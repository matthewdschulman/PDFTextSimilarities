Stability Analysis Method Independent of Numerical Integration for
Limit Cycle Walking with Constraint on Impact Posture

AbstractÑThis paper proposes the method independent of
numerical integration for analyzing the stability of a limit cycle
walker that falls down as a 1-DOF rigid body in the same
posture. We introduce the model of an underactuated rimless
wheel with a torso for analysis and show that the transition
function of the state error can be analytically derived from
the recurrence formula of kinetic energy immediately before
impact. We theninvestigate theaccuracy of thederived solution
through comparison with the numerical solutions and discuss
how the convergence property changes with respect to the
control parameter. Furthermore, we extend the method to an
underactuated biped and show that the stability analysis can be
conducted in a similar manner without performing numerical
simulations.
I. INTRODUCTION
Recent robotic walkers that are energy efÞcient and high
speed tend to generate a walking gait as a stable limit cycle
including discrete events but without adequate consideration
ofstabilityassurance.Thestabilityinherentinroboticlegged
locomotion as a limit cycle with impulse effects was orig-
inally discussed by Hosoe et al. [1] They applied a high-
gain PD feedback control to a planar linearized limit cycle
walker so that it falls down as a 1-DOF rigid body in the
same posture immediately before every impact (constraint
on impact posture), and showed that the equilibrium point
can be determined by conducting iterative calculation of the
angularvelocityatimpact.Afterthat,Grizzleetal.developed
more rigorous theory for nonlinear limit-cycle walkers with
constraint on impact posture and showed that the stability
of the generated gait is equivalent to that of the step-to-step
behavior [2].
The authors have also studied the problem [3][4] and
recently achieved to derive the analytical solutions to the
transition functions of the state error in limit cycle walking
with constraint on impact posture [5]. Assuming that the
walker achievesthe constraintonimpactposturebya strictly
outputfollowing control,we can reduce the redundantreturn
map to a scalar function of the stance angular velocity
immediately after impact to the next immediately before
impact. The analytical solution of the transition function,
ø
Q ? R for the stance phase, enabled us to mathematically
calculate the Poincar« e return map. It included, however, the
steady parameters in the generated gait such as the step
period and the angular velocity [3]. The stability of the
collision phase on the other hand can be easily proved
because the absolute value of the transition function of the

state error,
ø
R ?R, is less than 1. After these investigations,
we succeeded in eliminating the step period from
ø
Q [4].
Finally, we achieved to derive the analytical solution of
ø
Q
for a 1-DOF active walker as a function only of the control
parameters [5].
Based on these observations, in this paper we revisit
the problem of stability analysis for general limit-cycle
walkers with constraint on impact posture and show that it is
possible to analyze the stability of the generatedgait without
numerical integration. First, we introduce an underactuated
rimlesswheelmodelforanalysisanddescribethemethodfor
analytically derivingthe transition functionof the state error.
Unlike the previous method [3][4][5], the novel approach
for derivation is very easy and is based only on mechanical
energy balance. We discuss the accuracy of the analytical
ø
Q through numerical investigations. Second, we extend the
method to an underactuated biped model and show that the
stability analysis can be performed in a similar manner as
the previous one.

Fig. 1 shows the model of an underactuatedrimless wheel
with a torso [6]. This walker consists of an eight-legged
symmetrically-shaped rimless wheel (RW) and a torso link.
The relative angle between two adjacent leg frames, ?,is
¹/4 [rad]. The torso link is connected to the RW at the
central position and the moment of inertia about the joint is
I [kgám

].

Next, we outline the collision dynamics. We assume the
followings.
¥ The walker falls down as a 1-DOF rigid body or
achieves the condition of
ú
?

=
ú
?

immediately before
the next impact.
¥ The torso is mechanically locked to the RW during the
collision. This condition is mathematically represented
by
ú
?

?

.
On the above assumptions, the transition equation for the
angular velocity becomes

Under this condition,a strict output following control can be

gait the following relation holds.

Therefore the walker can strictly control y without including

We calculate the value of the analytical

following procedure.

(P4) Calculate

(P5) Increase T

In fast convergent gaits, the denominator of Eq. (34) con-
verges to zero as well as the numerator in a few steps, that
is, Eq. (34) becomes an indeterminate form. Therefore we
calculate the numerical solutions of
ø

the nonlinear models as the mean value for the Þrst three

V. EXTENSION TO UNDERACTUATED BIPED
A. Problem Formulation
This section discusses the case of a planar underactuated
bipedal walker shown in Fig. 6. Since this model has already
been used in our previous papers, we omit the details. We
assume the followings.
¥ This walker consists of two identical leg frames with
semicircular feet whose radius is r [m] and can exert
the hip-joint torque, u
H
.
¥ The walker controls the relative hip-joint angle, ?
H
:=
?
1
? ?
2
to strictly follow the desired-time trajectory,
?
Hd
(t), during every stance phase and ?
H
moves from
?2? to 2? [rad].

C. Stability Analysis
Fig. 7 shows the time evolutions of the total mechanical
energy of the nonlinear model and E(x) of the linearized
model in level dynamic walking where T
set
=0.7 [s] and
?=0.2 [rad]. The robotÕs physical parameters were chosen
as the same as in [3]. We can see that there is a certain
amount of error between the two orbits but the amounts
of their restorations are almost the same. The maxima of
the total mechanical energy and E(x) are almost the same
but the values before and after impact are a little different.
This comes from the differencebetween the inertia matrices,
M(?) and M
0
. The non-diagonal elements of M(?) are
functions of ?
H
and the approximation error becomes larger
as ?
H
increases.
Fig. 8 plots the analytical
ø
Q and the numerical solutions
with respect to T
set
. We can see that the analytical solution
ø
Q shows a high accuracy except the neighborhood of the
deadbeat mode. As in the underactuated rimless wheel,
the convergence property changes from the speed mode to
the totter mode through the deadbeat mode. The author
expects that this change tendencycan be observedin general
underactuated walking gaits.

VI. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper, we theoretically showed that the stability
of limit cycle walking with constraint impact posture can
be determinedwithout performingnumerical integration.We
can easily derive the analytical solution of
ø
Q by utilizing
symbolic manipulation tools such as Mathematica. The sim-
ulation results showed that the accuracy of the analytical
solutions is sufÞciently high.
Now we are attempting to extend the method to multi-
DOF models such as a kneed biped. The load of symbolic
manipulationwould become heavier and Þnding the solution
is left as a future work.
