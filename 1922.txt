Power Steering and Force Display Controls for a Cycling Wheelchair
using Servo Brakes
Yasuhisa Hirata, Kazuhiro Kosuge, and Eric Monacelli
Abstract—In this study, we present a new type of wheelchair
called the cycling wheelchair, in which the user moves the
wheelchair by pedaling with his/her legs and changes direction
using a steering handle. This wheelchair has great potential
not only as an effective rehabilitation device but also as a
mobility assistive device. However, the commercially available
model has several hardware limitations that affect the steering
operation. In this paper, we discuss these hardware limitations
before presenting methods for improving steering maneuver-
ability. Furthermore, we propose power steering and force
display controls based on environmental information. From the
perspective of safety, we employ servo brakes to control the
cyclingwheelchair,andtheassistivefunctionsarerealizedbased
on the feasible braking control region. The proposed control
methods are experimentally applied to a newly developed
cycling wheelchair with servo brakes, and the results illustrate
the validity of the control methods.
I. INTRODUCTION
Patients with impairment of their lower extremities ﬁnd
it difﬁcult to walk and may therefore use mobility assis-
tive devices such as wheelchairs. However, most standard
wheelchairs are operated by the arms via a hand rim. Thus,
muscular strength in the legs declines because of disuse, and
patients may also experience discomfort from exerting their
arms.
A new wheelchair has been developed for rehabilitating
patients with severe impairment of the lower extremities [1].
This wheelchair is known as the ”Cycling Wheelchair” as
shown in Fig. 1, and it is based on a pedal-driven system
similar to a bicycle. In [1], it was reported that by func-
tional electrical stimulation (FES), patients could use their
disabled legs to rotate the pedals of the cycling wheelchair.
Following extensive clinical tests, a medical doctor observed
that hemiplegic patients can move the cycling wheelchair
without FES [2]; the healthy leg could apply high torque
to one pedal of the system while the disabled leg did not
interfere with the rotational pedaling motion. Furthermore,
we asked many patients with a range of impairments of the
lower extremities, including paraplegia, to use the cycling
wheelchair. From these clinical tests, it was observed that
many patients can pedal the cycling wheelchair if they have
slight mobility in their legs.
The cycling wheelchair is now commercially available
from TESS Co. Ltd., Japan [3] and has encouraged user par-

ticipation in outdoor activities. Several patients with cycling
wheelchairs enjoy shopping in supermarkets, travelling, and
performing other such activities. By promoting enjoyment
in performing outdoor activities, the cycling wheelchair pro-
vides these patients with an effective means of rehabilitation.
However, patients with severe impairment of the lower ex-
tremities sometimes cannot maneuver the cycling wheelchair
in outdoor environments because of barriers such as steep
slopes, obstacles, and steps. Particular hazards include reach-
ing excessive downhill speeds and falling down the steps. To
minimize such risks, we have developed a method of braking
control that employs servo brakes [4], and realized several
assistive functions such as gravity compensation control and
obstacle avoidance control.
A further limitation of the commercially available de-
sign of the cycling wheelchair involves the steering han-
dle. Because of hardware limitations affecting the steering
operation, users perceive right and left turns differently and
require a high operating torque to change the direction of the
cycling wheelchair. In addition, unlike a traditional hand rim
wheelchair, the cycling wheelchair cannot easily be propelled
from behind by a caregiver.
To overcome these limitations we propose a power steering
control that can reduce the force required to steer the cycling
wheelchair. Additionally, we propose a force display control
that can guide the user in applying force to the steering
handle by providing environment-speciﬁc information. Gen-
erally, an active actuator such as a servo motor attached
to the steering handle realizes the power steering control.
However, in this study, we focus on the wheel braking control
of the cycling wheelchair. In our previous research [4], we
implemented a braking-based assistive control. The braking
system is an indispensable safety feature for real world
wheelchair use. Thus, our design utilizes a brake system
attached to the wheels to implement the power steering and

force display controls without using servo motors. In general,
the braking system cannot amplify human applied force. The
proposed power steering control is realized by appropriately
combining the braking force with a proportion of the human
pedaling force. That is, the pedaling force, which is much
greater than the force generated by the arms, compensates for
the insufﬁcient force of the arms for the steering operation.
In this paper, weﬁrst consider the hardware-based steering
limitations of the commercially available cycling wheelchair,
and then describe a new design of the cycling wheelchair
with servo brakes. Next, we propose a method for power
steering control using the servo brakes, and extend this
method to realize a force display control that provides user
guidance based on environmental information. Finally, we
apply the proposed method to the cycling wheelchair and
describe our experimental results, which illustrate the validity
of our design.
II. CYCLING WHEELCHAIR WITH SERVO BRAKES
A. Limitations of the Commercially Available Cycling
Wheelchair
The commercially available cycling wheelchair has a
steering wheel as shown in Fig. 1. The user can change
the angle of the steering wheel using the steering handle,
which is connected to the steering wheel via a wire. The
pedaling torque applied by the user is transmitted only to
the right wheel; the left wheel is passive. The right, left,
and steering wheels are in contact with the ground to give
the cycling wheelchair 1 degree of freedom (DOF) around
an instantaneous center of rotation. As the position of the
instantaneous center of rotation is determined by the angle
of the steering wheel, its angle changes the direction of the
wheelchair. However, as the pedaling torque is transmitted to
the right wheel alone, the user perceives right and left turns
differently, with right turns requiring more pedaling torque.
Furthermore, the user has to apply substantial torque to
the steering handle to change the angle of the steering
wheel. This necessitates a large offset between the steering
lever and the rotational point of the handle. However, if we
increase the offset of the steering lever, the user cannot use
the wheelchair in narrow spaces where obstacles such as
walls restrict steering operation. In addition, if the user has
an impairment of the upper extremities, he/she may not be
able to move his/her arms sufﬁciently to operate the steering
handle. As the result, the offset of the steering lever has to
be small and the user must apply high steering torque.
On occasions when the user cannot apply sufﬁcient driving
force to the wheelchair, a caregiver may assist the user
by applying force from the rear. However, as the cycling
wheelchair has 1 DOF of motion determined by the angle of
the steering wheel, the caregiver cannot change the direction
of the cycling wheelchair directly by applying moment to it.
That is, only the user can change the direction of the cycling
wheelchair, and the caregiver has to lift up the steering wheel
while turning the wheelchair if he/she wants to move it
without the operation of the user.

B. New Cycling Wheelchair
To overcome the above limitations, we have developed
a new cycling wheelchair to which a differential gear, a
steering caster, and servo brakes are attached. The differential
gear is attached to the axis of the right and left wheels, and
the pedaling torque is transmitted to each wheel equally. The
differential gear improves maneuverability and enables the
user to perceive right and left turns equally. Additionally,
we have changed the steering wheel to a caster with offset.
The standard wheel does not have an offset between the
wheel axis and its pivot shaft, so that the motion around
the pivot shaft is nonholonomic. Conversely, the caster has
an offset and the motion around the pivot shaft is holonomic.
Therefore, the cycling wheelchair can achieve translational
motion in the forward direction and rotational motion around
the center of the wheel axis without being disturbed by the
motion of the steering caster. This motion characteristic is the
same as that of a standard wheelchair, so that the caregiver
can propel the cycling wheelchair from behind.
To implement power steering control and display the force
to the steering handle based on environmental information,
we have attached servo brakes to the right and left wheels.
By applying braking torque to each wheel independently, we
can apply moment to the cycling wheelchair to change its
direction. This moment contributes to the assistive motion of
the steering handle to realize the power steering and force
display controls.
Power steering control is generally implemented using
active actuators such as servo motors. When focusing solely
on the directional control of the system, Cobot architecture,
as proposed in [5], is a good solution. It enables servo
motor control of the steering wheel angle. Conversely, the
methods of motion control presented in our previous research
employed servo brakes to implement multiple functions,
such as velocity and obstacle avoidance controls, for a
walking support system [6], an object handling system [7],
and a cycling wheelchair [4]. The proposed braking control
methods realized not only the velocity control but also the
rotational control of the system with mobility. In addition,

the angle of the steering caster.

By generating the moment n

from the servo brakes attached
to the wheels, we can achieve power assist control of the
steering handle.
In this study, we have assumed that the wire has elasticity;
as a result, the power steering control is achieved without
using a force/torque sensor. If the wire does not have
elasticity, we would have to design a steering system with
a compliance that mimics the elasticity of the wire. That is,
when we measure the relative angles between the steering
handle and the steering wheel, power steering control is
achieved using the proposed method. Thus, we can develop
an intuitive steering interface, similar to a joystick, to suit
the user’s level of disability by considering the compliance
of the interface. Certainly, if a force sensor is attached to
the steering handle, the power steering control is realized
without using the elasticity of the wire or the compliance of
the new interface.
B. Force Display Control
When the wheelchair is used in a complex environment
containing obstacles, the system should provide the user with
environmental information. While this could be presented via
an audiovisual interface, our system provides environmental
information by applying an intentional force to the steering
handle.
In addition, patients with severe impairments of the upper
extremities may not be able to apply appropriate force to
the steering handle. According to the observations of a
medical doctor, some patients moved the steering handle in
an oscillatory manner and could not keep the wheelchair
moving in a straight line. In such cases, it would be ben-
eﬁcial to display the force to the steering handle to avoid
steering the wheelchair in an unintended direction. Using
this force display control, we can implement path following
functionality.
To implement force display control, we determine the
direction of the cycling wheelchair from environmental in-
formation, and then generate a force for rotating the steering
caster in the intended direction. In our system we redesign
the apparent dynamics of the steering caster expressed in
eq.(7) as follows:

where k

From the above equation, we can calculate the braking
moment as follows:
n
cb
= k(?? 1)(?

(?

When we do not use the force display control, ?

is equal to
?

. In this case, the motion dynamics of the steering caster
is the same as that shown in eq.(7).
C. Braking Control Method
To implement the power steering and force display con-
trols, we have to derive the braking forces of the right and
left wheels of the cycling wheelchair F

using the JacobianJ as follows:
F
bw
=J
T
N

where N

T
denotes the braking moment deter-
mined by eq.(10).
In most cases using the above equation, the sign of the
braking torque for each wheel is the opposite for generating
the moment around the center of the cycling wheelchair.
However, the servo brake cannot generate active torque, that
is, the output direction of the braking torque is restricted
by the rotational direction of the wheel. Thus, we have to
consider a feasible braking control region and then determine
the appropriate braking torques of the wheels [7].
As explained above, to achieve rotational motion based on
the moment expressed by eq.(10), one of the wheels must
accelerate. However, the braking system cannot generate
wheel acceleration, and in this case, the desired moment is
outside the feasible braking control region A(U) as shown
in Fig. 4. Therefore, a wheel that can output an adequate
braking torque generates a high braking torque to achieve
the braking moment shown in eq.(10).
We determine the output braking force F

where T is the distance between the right and left wheels. As
the angular velocity of the left wheel is decreased and cannot

for this loss. Conversely, when the wheelchair turns right,
we have

There are multiple solutions for f

equations. We have to consider how the output braking
force/moment in the feasible braking control region can
be determined. As shown in Fig. 4, the braking moment
determined by eq.(10) is generated by combining the output
braking force/moment with a compensation force provided
by a part of the human applied pedaling force. This suggests
that steering assist control is achieved using the braking

moment generated by the servo brakes in combination with
the human pedaling force. In general, the user can apply a
large force to the pedal, and this can be used to compensate
for the insufﬁcient force provided by the arms for steering.
However, the greater the compensation force, the greater
the burden on the user. To reduce this burden, the braking
force/moment should be determined at the boundary of the
feasible braking control region as shown in Fig. 4.
IV. EXPERIMENTS FOR ASSESSING STEERING ASSIST
CONTROL
We modiﬁed a cycling wheelchair according to the pro-
posed methods and experimentally conﬁrmed their validity.
First, we evaluated the power steering control of the cycling
wheelchair, followed by the force display control, which
enabled path following functionality. To evaluate the ex-
periments, we attached a 6-axes force/torque sensor (WDF-
6A200-3, WACOH-TECH Inc.) to the steering handle and
measured the force applied by the user during the experi-
ments. This sensor did not user any controls of the cycling
wheelchair. The experiments were performed by a healthy
subject, who could operate the cycling wheelchair smoothly.
The results are presented in the following sections.
A. Power Steering Control
In this experiment, we assumed that the elastic coefﬁcient
of the wire k in eq.(8) was 2.5 Nm/rad, and conducted the
experiment by specifying the power assist ratio ?. First, we
speciﬁed the ratio as ?=1. This equation indicates that the
experiment was performed without power steering control.
Next, we speciﬁed the ratio as ?=2 to reduce the required
force by half.
In these experiments, the subject operated the cycling
wheelchair to generate rotational motion. Fig. 5(a) shows
the paths of the cycling wheelchair with ? =1 (without
control) and ? =2. The subject attempted to move the
cycling wheelchair along the same path in each experiment.
Fig. 5(b) and (c) express the absolute value of the forces
applied to the steering handle during the experiments. These
results indicate that the power steering control reduces the
force required for steering by approximately half.
As the proposed method requires both braking
force/moment and human pedaling force to implement
power steering control, the user must expend greater effort
in pedaling. However, the subject did not perceive his

he could apply greater force to the pedal relative to the
compensation force of the power steering control. We will
evaluate user exertion quantitatively in a future study.
B. Force Display Control
In this set of experiments, we displayed the force to the
steering handle based on environmental information. First,
we speciﬁed two types of paths to the cycling wheelchair:
straight and S-shaped. We did not use the power steering
control to evaluate only force display control. That is, ?=1.
The desired angle of the steering caster ?
cd
was initially
speciﬁed as zero. In this experiment, the cycling wheelchair
moved along a straight path. The subject turned the steering
handle in an oscillatory manner to mimic a patient with
severe impairment of the upper extremities. The results in
Fig. 6 show that the subject moved along a straight path,
although he applied a large force to rotate the cycling
wheelchair.
Next, we speciﬁed the desired angle of the steering caster
as ?
cd
= 45 sinx degree, where x is the moving distance of
the cycling wheelchair with respect to the forward direction.

line on the ground, we can calculate the desired angle of the
steering caster from the sensor data. In this experiment, the
subject did not apply a large force to the steering handle, and
moved his hand according to the force display information
at the steering handle.
The results of this experiment are shown in Fig. 7. Fig.
7(a) shows the actual path of the cycling wheelchair and Fig.
7(b) shows the force applied to the steering handle. Although
the cycling wheelchair achieved rotational motion, the human
force applied to the steering handle was very small compared
to that observed in the previous experiment shown in Fig.
5(b). This result shows that the force display guides the user’s
hand appropriately based on environmental information.
V. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
In this study, we designed a power assist control for the
steering handle of a cycling wheelchair. In addition, we
implemented force display control at the steering handle
based on environmental information. The proposed methods
were realized by controlling the servo brakes attached to the
wheels of the cycling wheelchair. We applied the proposed
methods to the newly developed cycling wheelchair and
experimentally veriﬁed their validity.
The cycling wheelchair has great potential not only as
a rehabilitation device but also as a mobility assist device
to improve participation in daily activities. Many patients
have already used cycling wheelchairs for rehabilitation, and
most of them want to use these wheelchairs in outdoor
environments. Medical doctors and therapists have also eval-
uated the cycling wheelchair. In future research, we intend to
further evaluate our proposed control methods by performing
extensive tests with patients, medical doctors, and therapists,
