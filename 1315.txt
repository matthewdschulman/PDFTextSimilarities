Dynamic Movement Primitives for Cooperative Manipulation and
Synchronized Motions
Jonas Umlauft, Dominik Sieber and Sandra Hirche
AbstractÑCooperative manipulation, where several robots
jointly manipulate an object from an initial conÞguration to
a Þnal conÞguration while preserving the robot formation,
poses a great challenge in robotics. Here, we treat the problem
of designing motion primitives for cooperative manipulation
such that the robots move in formation and are robust with
respect to external disturbances. Individual robot trajectories
are generated by Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMPs) and
coupled by a formation control approach enabling the DMP-
trajectories to preserve a given formation while performing
the manipulation. The proposed control scheme achieves an in-
creasedadaptabilityunderexternaldisturbances.Theapproach
is evaluated in a full-scale experiment with two prototypical
cooperative manipulation and synchronized motion tasks.
I. INTRODUCTION
Physical cooperation of robotic manipulators is important
in a wide variety of tasks such as joint object manipula-
tion under formation constraints and synchronized handover
tasks. Application domains are for example in manufactur-
ing, logistics, disaster relief, and service robotics. A coopera-
tivemanipulationtaskisconsideredeffectivelyaccomplished
when the multi-robot team jointly manipulates the object
from an initial conÞguration to a Þnal conÞguration without
damaging theobject, i.e. without exerting excessive forces. If
therobotsareabletomaintainarigidformation,,theinternal
forces are signiÞcantly reduced [1]. In order to achieve
successful task execution, a ßexible, robust, and distributed
control mechanism is required. The control architecture is
called distributed if there is no central coordinating entity,
i.e. each manipulator has its own local controller which
may communicate with other local controllers to achieve the
overall control goal.
Different control approaches have been proposed for co-
operative manipulation. A popular approach is based on
distributed impedance control, see for example [2]Ð[4].
Those approaches decouple the path planning and the con-
trol, i.e. individual trajectories are planned for each robotic
manipulator taking into account the object geometry and
grasp points [5], [6]. If feedback is missing in the path
planning, those approaches are very sensitive to the initial
conÞguration, the model accuracy, and in particular to ex-
ternal disturbances from the environment [7]. Embedding
the formation rigidity constraint in an LQR-like optimal
control problem is proposed in [8]. However, the approach
only considers the maintenance of the rigidity constraint

and is not suitable for establishing formations and synchro-
nized movements. A powerful tool for representing discrete
and periodic trajectories are Dynamic Movement Primitives
(DMPs)developedin[9]and[10].DMPsaremainlyusedfor
imitation and learning tasks of a single manipulator and are
therefore useful for representing and generating human-like
movements. To the best of the authors knowledge, multiple
dynamic motor primitives have not yet been investigated in
depth for cooperative manipulation except for preliminary
work in [11], where a bimanual task with force feedback is
considered without considering more than two DMPs.
The main contribution of the paper is a novel control
approach for cooperative manipulation and movement syn-
chronization. The approach is based on formation control
and coupled DMP-based trajectory planning. Here, DMPs
generate individual manipulator trajectories to a desired
Þnal conÞguration, which is in agreement with the initial
conÞguration of the multi-robot team. During the tracking
phase, it may happen that individual DMPs violate the
formation rigidity or disturbances occur on a single ma-
nipulator. The issue is circumvented in our approach by
using a formation-preserving feedback for each DMP. Minor
remaining deviations from the formation are accommodated
by local impedance control laws in each manipulator such
that they react compliantly to their environment. Our pro-
posed control and trajectorygeneration approach is evaluated
in experiments and its robustness against perturbations and
reduced internal forces on the object are demonstrated for
cooperative manipulation and synchronized motion tasks.
The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Sec-
tion II formally describes DMPs and formation control. The
proposed extension for DMPs for cooperative manipulation
is presented in Section III, the experimental evaluation is
presented in Section IV.

feedback in real-time [12]. The following attractor dynamic
ensures that the solution of the point attractive system, the
trajectory x(t), converges towards the goal g [13]

are the weights, the centers and the radii,
respectively, of the radial basis function distributed along
the trajectory. Those parameters are determined during the
learning process using Locally Weighted Projection Regres-
sion (LWPR) [14]. The parameters ?,? > 0 are set prior to
the learning process. The timing parameter ? > 0 is adjusted
before the execution of the movement to speed it up or slow
it down compared to the demonstration. A phase variable s
is used in (3) instead of time to make the dependency of
f(s) on time more implicit [13]. The dynamics of the phase
variable s are deÞned by a canonical system
? ú s =??s, ? > 0. (4)
The advantage of using the phase variable s instead of
explicit time is that we are able to modify the evolution of
time by appropriately adapting (4) during execution [13].
Thus by decelerating the canonical system, it is possible
to slow down the execution of the steering function f(s),
which reduces the speed of the movement, e.g. in case of
disturbances. Obviously, s ? 0 as t ? ° and therefore
the nonlinear function f(s) tends to zero as time increases.
Thus, theasymptotically stableequilibriumpoint ofthepoint

As a result trajectories x(t) generated by DMPs ensure the
discrete movement from the initial point x

to the goal g.
DMPs are also used to generate trajectories for periodic
movements. In contrast to discrete movements the steering
function f will not approach zero because it is a weighted
sumofperiodicfunctions?(?)multipliedbytheamplituder

(2) using the frequency of the oscillation ½ = 1/? yields
ú z = ½(?(?(g?x)?z)+f(?)) (6)
ú x = ½z. (7)
For periodical movements, the phase variable ? increases
constantly as opposed to s and is given by
ú
? = ½. (8)
B. Formation Control
A common approach to formation control is to use a
ArtiÞcial Potential Field (APF) in order to achieve a desired
distance d
ij
between two agents i and j [16]. Often a
quadratic potential ÞeldV
ij
(kx

has its global minimum at the desired distance d

is a positive parameter that is used to adjust the
speed of convergence to the desired formation. Under this
control law all agents converge to the desired formation [17].
C. Impedance Control
In order to accommodate for minor deviations of the
desired position trajectories from the formation constraints
weproposetoemployimpedancecontrolhere.Therefore,the
manipulator measures contact forces at its end-effector. The
Cartesian impedance control law is described as following
M¬ e+Dú e+Ke =?, (11)
where M,D,K ? R
n?n
are the mass, the damping and
the stiffness matrices, respectively. Here, n denotes the
workspace dimension, ??R
n
is the applied force and
e = ø x?x is the deviation of the actual end effector position
ø x?R
n
from the desired position x?R
n
. The trajectories
for the desired positions x, velocities ú x, and accelerations
¬ x are required as input to the impedance control law and
are generated using DMPs. The position x
i
is expressed in
a world coordinate system ?
w
which requires that each end-
effectorisawareofitstransformationtoacommonreference.
III. COOPERATIVE DMPS
The goal is to introduce a novel approach for DMP-based
formation control for generating cooperative movements of
N manipulators in a n-dimensional workspace. For the
proposed control law, rotational motions of each manipulator
are neglected so that the DMPs are represented by decoupled
dynamics for each Cartesian degree of freedom (DoF).
Foreachdegreeoffreedomweuseasinglepointattractive
system (1), (2) and one canonical system (4). Here, x
i
denotes the state of the manipulator i, which consists of
the Cartesian positions x
i,k
in each dimension k of the
workspace, thus x
i
= [x
i,1
,...,x
i,n
]
T
. The states of all
manipulators are concatenated into x = [x
T
1
,...,x
T
N
]
T
.
Note that, x
i,k
describes the single state of a manipulator
corresponding to the x used in (1),(2). The goal conÞgura-
tion g is an accordingly concatenated vector. The desired
trajectory x, ú x which is generated by n? N DMPs and
767
tracked by the impedance control law (11) requires to satisfy
the rigidity constraint among the cooperating manipulators.
Since each DMP only knows its own state, we establish a
communication link between neighboring DMPs and employ
a cooperative term to modify the individual states. A DMP
is called a neighbor of another DMP, if formation rigidity
requiresadesireddistancetobemaintained.Here,eachDMP
reliesontherelativepositiontoitsneighbors andisattractive
to the desired formation even under external disturbances.
The graph representing the communication structure among
thesystemsofDMPswhichisformulatedbytheneighboring
set is chosen such that the minimum number of neighbors
for rigidity of the formation is guaranteed. For more details
on formation rigidity the reader is referred to [18].
In order to extend DMPs for cooperative manipulation the
ability to react to the movements of other manipulators is
important. Therefore we introduce a cooperation feedback
term into the DMPs. Our approach is inspired by [9] where
DMPs are enhanced to react to external perturbations. Ac-
cording to [12] the point attractive system (1) and (2) can
be augmented to incorporate feedback as follows
? ú z = ?(?(g?x)?z)+f(s) (12)
? ú x = z +?
err
(÷ x?x), (13)
where ÷ x denotes the measured position of the manipulator,
whereas x is the desired position. The slowing of the
phase variable s until the error is reduced is a key feature
of this approach. Note that the phase variable s directly
controls the steering function f(s), which also decelerates
proceeding until the error is compensated. According to [15]
the canonical system is augmented to
? ú s =?
?s
1+?
err
(÷ x?x)
2
. (14)
Here, we propose to use a feedback term to enforce the
formation based on the input given by the formation control
law in (10). Therefore, a deviation in the relative distance
of the neighbors to the desired distance d
ij
is interpreted as
an error term and is compensated before further proceeding
to the goal. The point attractive system and the canonical
system of manipulator i in dimension k is reformulated as

where ?

Thus, the cooperation term is zero if the desired distances
to all neighbors are maintained and (15), (16), (17) are
equivalent to the original DMPs from (1) , (2) and (4),

In case the formation is violated, higher ?

functions. Increasing ?

affects the point attractive systems
to react faster to disturbances of the formation. Given
this enhancement, DMPs are applicable for a cooperative
manipulation task or the generation of synchronized periodic
movement. The schematic overview of the control scheme
and its references in this work are illustrated in Fig. 1.
A task plan provides the goal conÞgurations g and the
inter-robot distances d
ij
. The individual desired trajectories
are generated by DMPs and then tracked by the impedance.
A cooperative feedback term is introduced to enforce the
desired distance by a formation control law.
Equilibria and Domain of Attraction
Asthepointattractingsystem(15)and(16)andthecanon-
ical system (17) are modiÞed we investigate the equilibria
of the attractor landscape of the augmented system. Anal-
ogously to the argumentation in [9], the stability properties
of the canonical system are preserved, i.e. the equilibrium

cancel each other out, which is illustrated in the top row of
Fig. 2. A cancellation is possible if the vectors are linearly
dependent and point in opposite directions. This explana-
tion also provides an intuitive understanding of the domain
of attraction of the undesired equilibrium. The domain of
attraction describes the subspace, from which the agents
start and can end up in an undesired equilibrium. Here, the
domain of attraction of the undesired equilibrium is given by
a line through the goal conÞgurations with both agents being
in switched conÞguration (compared to the goal positions).
For practical application the undesired equilibrium is largely
irrelevant as small perturbations allow the agents to escape
this domain. For N = 3 one undesired equilibrium is
illustratedinthebottomrowofFig.2.Incaseofmoreagents
the approach is similar, however the undesired equilibria and
their domain of attraction is more complicated to compute;
its formal analysis is still part of ongoing research.
IV. EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION
A. Experimental Setup
The experimental setup consists of two commercially
available KUKA LWR 4+ (light-weight robot), see Fig. 3.
Both manipulators are assembled on top of the same mobile
platform in order to avoid issues such as communication and
kinematic uncertainties at this preliminary stage. A Carte-
sian impedance control scheme (11) is employed to ensure
compliance of the end-effectors. Both Cartesian positions are
captured by a QualiSys motion capture system. A workspace
extension by a mobile platform of both robotic manipulators
is accomplished according to the approach presented in [3].
The manipulator motion and the mobile platform motion
are kinematically decoupled in task-space with an employed
potential function. The parameters for DMPs are chosen
equally for each manipulator in all dimensions as exhibited
in Table I distinguished in discrete and periodic movements.

robotic manipulators. For this experiment, the robot per-
forms a planar cooperative manipulation task with two end-
effectors. The desired trajectory x
demo
is generated from
demonstrations by LWPR [14]. The task is to carry a beam
in a discrete movement. In order to demonstrate the efÞcacy
of our proposed approach, we remove the beam between the
manipulators and identify the effect of cooperation without
physical coupling. During the movement a disturbance is
imposed on one robotic manipulator by pushing against it.
Due to the impedance control law the manipulator deviates
from the desired trajectory x
2
.
The results of this experiment are shown in Fig. 4. It
is obvious that a disturbance acting on manipulator has no
effect on the other one if cooperation feedback is turned off.
When the cooperation feedback is turned on, the disturbance
affects both manipulators simultaneously. As desired, the
formation is restored by the cooperative DMP approach.
C. Motion Synchronization
Thesecondexperimentinvestigatestheideaofcooperating
DMPs for periodic movements. For this experiment both
manipulators oscillate in phase with the same frequency
and amplitude in one direction. During this experiment we
turn the formation feedback on and off and observe the
synchronizationoftwomanipulatorsafterbeingoutofphase.
We simulate a disturbance on one of the manipulators by
Þxing it manually for a short time. With this experiments,
we demonstrate that disturbances acting on one of the ma-
nipulator also affect the trajectories of the other manipulator.
The results of this experiment with and without coop-
eration are shown in Fig. 5. After one cycle (Å 8s) the
cooperation is turned off and the two manipulators are
drifting apart. At tÅ 18s manipulator 1 is Þxed at its
current position manually, simulating a disturbance. After
it is released at tÅ 22s it keeps oscillating but the two
manipulators are not in phase. So at tÅ 26s the cooperation
isturnedonagainandabothmanipulatorsaresynchronizing.
D. Reducing internal forces
In a further experiment we show the reduction of internal
forces acting on the object. In this experiment both manip-
ulators follow a discrete movement. A beam is rotationally
free Þxed at the manipulators. For the discrete movement
individual trajectories are generated using DMPs which
violate the formation constraint.
Using DMPs without cooperation results in signiÞcant in-
ternal forces acting on the object because both manipulators
follow trajectories that deviate from the desired formation.
Due to impedance control the deviation causes a force on
the object deÞned by (11). Using cooperative DMPs the
trajectories are adjusted such that they match the desired
formation. As desired, this results in reduction of forces
acting on the object as shown in Fig. 6.
V. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper we propose a novel control approach for
cooperative manipulation and synchronization based on co-
operative dynamic movement primitives (DMPs). A coop-
eration feedback term based on an artiÞcial potential Þeld
for formation control is introduced into the original DMP
formulation. The equilibria analysis provides desired and un-
desired equilibria, however, the undesired equilibria turn out
to be of no practical relevance. The effectiveness and quality
of the proposed controller with respect to disturbances is
successfully demonstrated in experiments.
