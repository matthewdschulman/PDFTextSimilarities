Abstract— This paper presents a 14-DOF robotic hand 
including 5 fingers and a wrist. The hand has a new 
tendon-driven mechanism which minimizes frictional loss and 
maximizes efficiency and backdrivability. In order to accomplish 
high efficiency and backdrivability as well as human-like 
payload and dexterity in a compact size, two novel mechanical 
concepts are proposed. Firstly, the actuators are placed 
according to the functions of fingers – high power grasping and 
precise manipulation - instead of positioning at each joint. For 
the high power grasping, 7 high payload motors are positioned in 
the forearm, and 5 small size motors are positioned in the palm 
for the precise manipulation. Secondly, a new tension decoupling 
mechanism is proposed to the 2-DOF wrist joint, which delivers 
wire motions of the forearm motors to the fingers without 
frictional loss or coupling with wrist motion. A total weight 
including the forearm is 1.59kg which is similar to human. The 
fingertip force is 15N which is sufficient for most of household 
work. High backdrivability enables the contact force sensing by 
measuring a motor current without additional sensors. A 
detectable minimum contact force was 0.735N. In order to 
enhance the contact force sensing capability, a friction 
compensation algorithm was applied, which resulted to the 
minimum contact force as 0.196N. Theoretical and experimental 
analyses are also performed. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
UMAN hands are one of the most versatile tools of 
organic devices. They can not only exert high forces 
when compliantly grasping various objects, but can also 
precisely manipulate small objects. Robotic hands have been 
evolved in order to mimic these two characteristics.  
Research on robotic hands can be roughly categorized into 
two groups: the dexterous robot hands with high degrees of 
freedom (DOF) and the compliant robot hands with an 
underactuated mechanism or flexible material. A high DOF 
dexterous robot hands have been developed over several 
decades, e.g. the MIT/Utah hand [1], Robonaut Hand by 
NASA [2], DLR hand [3], Dexterous Hand by Shadow Co., 
GIFU hand [4] and AIST hand [5]. These hands have from 12 
DOF to18 DOF and have the same number of actuators. Due 
to a large number of actuators, they are prone to have 
substantial size and weight or relatively low payload .

Small motors with high reduction gears can increase the 
payload, but the hand loses backdrivability and speed. Placing 
large size and high torque motors in the forearm has been 
frequently tried to reduce the size of hands. Wires and 
conduits are commonly used for the cable tension 
transmission from the forearm to the fingers, and torsion 
cables for transferring rotational motion as well [2]. These are 
simple and effective approaches to decouple the finger motion 
from the wrist. However, they can restrict the wrist range of 
motion and increase the frictional loss. 
The other category is on compliant robot hands with 
underactuated mechanisms [6]. The mechanical compliance 
enables grasping of various objects without complicated 
control with a large number of actuators. Moreover, payload 
can be easily increased by using a small number of high torque 
actuators. Recently, due to these advantages, the 
underactauted mechanism has been widely applied to the 
robot hands such as prosthetic hands or graspers for exploring 
field [7,8]. However, the downside is that precise 
manipulation is inherently difficult.  
Our goal is to develop a life-size robotic hand having both 
of the precise manipulability and the compliant power 
grasping capability. Our main reason developing human like 
robotic hands is for robots to share human tools and 
environment. From this point of view, we do not have to 
mimic the human hand anatomy. Instead, we adopt the 
advantages of human hands such as a size, shape, weight, and 
even payloads in the functional level. The developed robotic 
hand, named RoboRay hand, has 5 fingers with 12 DOF and a

wrist with 2 DOF. The new tendon driven mechanism 
minimizes frictional loss and increases efficiency and 
backdrivability. Linear actuators composed of motors and ball 
screws actuate fingers via wires and pulleys. In order to 
accomplish high efficiency and backdrivability, two novel 
mechanical concepts are applied. Firstly, the actuators are 
deployed according to the function of the finger instead of the 
joints. The grasping functions of the hand can be divided into 
power grasping by using whole hand and precision handling 
by using fingertips [11]. For the power grasping, 7 large-size 
motors are positioned in the wrist, and, for the precision 
handling, 5 small size motors are deployed in the palm. 
Secondly, a new 2-DOF tendon transmission mechanism is 
applied for the wrist joint, which facilitates tension 
transmission with low frictional loss and eliminates coupling 
between wrist motion and wire for the fingers. These high 
efficiency and backdrivability enables contact force sensing 
over whole contact points of fingers, while many other robotic 
hands rely on expensive force sensors.  
This paper is organized as follows: the design concepts are 
introduced in Section II. Section III describes the mechanical 
design in detail. In Section VI, a friction compensation 
algorithm was proposed in order to enhance the contact force 
sensing capability. The mechanical properties and the 
capabilities are investigated by the system analysis and 
experiments in Section V. Section VI concludes this paper. 
II. DESIGN CONCEPTS 
Fig.2 compares the size and shape of the developed robotic 
hand and the average adult male’s hand, where F1, F2, F3, F4 
and F5 denote the thumb, index finger, middle finger, ring 
finger and little finger, respectively. For 3-dimensional 
dexterous manipulation, 3-DOF for each of F1, F2 and F3 is 
indispensable, thus the hand was designed to have 3 DOFs for 
F1, F2 and F3. As shown in Fig.3(a), each finger of these has 3 
joints, named DIP, PIP, and MP joints. The DIP and PIP joint 
are coupled to flex together to have 1 DOF like human joints, 
and the 2-DOF MP joint is considered as 2 separated joints, 
named as MPP (MP pitch for flexion motion) and MPR (MP 
roll for abduction/adduction motion) joints. F4 and F5 have 
totally 3-DOF for underactuated grasping and adduction/ 
abduction motion. The size of the fingers and the palm was 
chosen similar to the humans, and the forearm is compact 
enough to be mounted on a robotic arm. The following 
describes the design concepts of the RoboRay hand: 
? Bio-mimetic mechanism based on functionality 
In order to adopt the advantages of the human hand without 
just mimicking the anatomy, we focused on the purpose and 
functionality of the human hand feature. A noteworthy feature 
of the human hand is that the large muscles for fingers are 
placed in the forearm as shown in Fig.2(b). The forearm is a 
useful place for both of the robotic hand and human hand to 
generate high force of fingers. In order not to sacrifice the 
efficiency and range of motion of the wrist while using 
forearm portion, we came up with a wrist mechanism different 
from humans, named 2-DOF tension decoupling mechanism, 
which will be explained in detail in Section III.A. 
Another feature worthwhile to consider is opposition 
between the thumb and other fingers. The high opposition 
enables delicate handling by using fingertips. Humans have 
highest opposability index 60 among primates followed by 
baboons 57-58 and orangutans 40 [12]. Therefore, we 
selected the thumb and finger configuration to achieve high 
opposability index 100 and completely opposing directions as 
shown in Fig.3(a) and it was verified in Section V.  
The other interesting feature of the human hand which can 
be overlooked is the configuration of MPR joints. Human 
fingertips can easily become adjacent as shown in Fig.3(b) 
because the MPR axes intersect the one point as shown in 
Fig.3(a), which is the key ability for 3 fingered manipulation 
of small objects. On the other hand, if the MPR axes are

parallel to each other, as many robotic hands, the fingertips are 
difficult to be touched each other near the center of palm. 
Therefore we designed the MPR direction for the axis to 
intersect one point as Fig.3(a) and it is verified in Section V. 
? Compactness and modularity 
Our goal is to use the robotic hands in the same 
environment for humans. As it must be mounted on a human 
-sized robotic arm, the compactness and modularity are also 
important factors. The forearm with 9 high force motors has 
the volume of 83mm? 76mm? 186mm, which is sufficiently 
compact to attach to a robotic arm with an elbow joint and a 
forearm rotation joint. The forearm includes the motor drivers 
and controllers, and the only electric connections are for the 
power and communication.  
For agile manipulation like humans, the robotic hand 
should be light-weight and the mass center is better to locate 
as close to the proximal position as human's hands and 
forearms. The implemented hand has 1.59kg which is similar 
to the human's weight 1.5kg and the mass center is one third of 
the total height. 
? Payload and Speed 
The fingertip force in a stretched pose as shown in Fig. 3(c) 
is one of the representative criterion of the robotic hand. 
Average adult can exert the peak fingertip force of about 40N. 
After investigating the conventional household works, we 
decided that more than 40N lifting force and 10N fingertip 
force are required.  
In addition to the payload, high speed is also crucial 
requirement for human like hand motion. The maximum 
finger joint speed is greater than 500deg/sec which is   
challenging for the mechanisms composed of small motors 
with high reduction gears. Therefore, in order to achieve the 
high payload and high speed, we utilized a forearm portion  
for high force motors with low reduction ratio and minimized 
the frictional loss throughout the transmission mechanisms.  
? Backdrivability 
Backdrivability implies more than energy conservation. 
The robotic hands with high reduction ratio have low 
backdrivability caused by the friction and damping of 
reduction gears. Thus, it is difficult to apply force control 
without force torque sensors or tactile sensors. Instead, they 
tend to utilize admittance control with aid of expensive force 
sensors or relatively unreliable tactile sensors. However, these 
approaches can restrict system bandwidth and it is difficult to 
deal with the contact on the hand surface where the sensors do 
not cover. In order to realize compliant manipulability like 
humans, backdrivability is essential.  
III. MECHANICAL DESIGN 
A. Actuator Configuration Based on the grasping functions  
Fig.4(a) illustrates the concept of conventional robotic 
fingers. For the convenience of explanation, it was simplified 
to 2-dimensional model where MPR joint was omitted. The 
motors are connected directly to the MP joint and the PIP joint, 
which simplifies the mechanism, but the motor payload is 
limited due to the size.  Especially, the small PIP motor in the 
finger frame severely hinders increasing the fingertip force.  
In order to overcome this problem, we propose a modified 
concept of the underactuated hands. As shown in Fig.4(b), the 
wire pair (blue and green line) from the high force motor is 
connected to PIP joint passing through a free rotating pulley 
on MPP joint, and the wire pair (red and purple line) from the 
small-size motor is connected to the MPP joint. If the 
small-size motor is turned off and the high force motor works, 
the fingers perform grasping motion as an underactuated hand 
as shown in Fig.4(c). On the other hand, if the high force 
motor is fixed and the small motor works, the pose of the

fingertip can be adjusted precisely as shown in Fig4.(d). Thus, 
considering the function of each motor, the high force motor 
and the small motor are named as grasp motor and pose motor, 
respectively.  
By mounting the pose motors and grasp motors properly in 
the palm and forearm (refer to Fig.2(a)), we can achieve a 
human-sized hand mechanism  which has the high force 
grasping capability as well as precise manipulation capability. 
Fig.5 shows the detailed design of the 3-DOF finger, which 
is actuated by the 3 wire pairs named grasp, pose and roll wire 
pairs and 1 wire pair for PIP and DIP joint coupling. In order 
to minimize friction, pulleys with bearings are used for the 
overall path of the wires. The mechanism of the grasp wire 
pair and the pose wire pair is conceptually the same as in 
Fig.4(b). However, the connection of the grasp and pose wire 
pair through the MPR joint is difficult to implement.   
Fig.4(a) and (b) illustrate the detail design and its 
conceptual diagram of the grasp and coupling wire pairs. The 
grasp wires pass through the MPR axis before connected to 
the actuator side. Thus the MPR motion does not affect the 
length of the grasp wires, instead they are slightly twisted. For 
the coupling between the DIP and PIP joints, a 8-shaped wire 
is used as shown in Fig.4(b). Fig.4(c) and (d) illustrate the 
detailed design and the conceptual diagram of the pose and 
roll wire pairs. As MPR axis center is already occupied by the 
grasp wires, an additional redirection pulley is used for the 
connection. As shown in Fig.5(d), the roll wire pairs actuate 
the MPR joint, whose actuator is also placed at the forearm 
portion.  
The three wire pairs are actuated by three linear actuators 
composed of ball screws and electric motors. If we denote the 
rotating angle of the roll, pose and grasp motors as

B. 2-DOF Tension decoupling mechanism for the wrist 
The proposed finger mechanism has high efficiency due to 
low frictional loss. However, the overall system can have low 
efficiency if the friction between the fingers and the actuators 
in the forearm and wrist is substantial. Moreover, wire 
connections between the fingers and the actuators are possible 
to limit the ranges of motion for the 2-DOF wrist.  
In order to minimize friction and maintain a human-like 
range of motion, we propose a new efficient and compact 
tension transmitting mechanism for the wrist. Fig. 6(a) shows 
a basic concept of a tension decoupling mechanism using a 
 
Fig. 6 Tendon decoupling mechanism 
 
Fig. 7 Detailed design of the wrist 
6715
  
rolling joint, where the joint is composed of two links with a 
cylindrical surface which has rolling contact and two freely 
rotating pulleys placed at the center of each cylindrical surface. 
The solid wire and dotted wire mean agonistic tendon and 
antagonistic tendon, respectively. Due to the rolling motion, 
the length of the two wires does not affect the motion of the 
joint.  
Another basic concept of tension decoupling mechanism 
uses an offset pivot, as shown in Fig. 6(b). The grooves of the 
three pulleys in this figure are on the pivot axis, and the wire 
going through these pulleys is collinear to the pivot axis. 
Therefore, the rotation of the pivot also does not affect the 
length of the wires. While rotating, the wires are slightly 
twisted. From repeated experiments, we obtained the safe 
range of motion for our system – approximately ±60°. 
By combining these two mechanisms, 2-DOF tension 
decoupling mechanisms was devised as shown in Fig.5(c). 
The rolling contact motion keeps the rotating angles in a fixed 
ratio:

. It satisfies our target range 
? ? ? ? ? 90 90

and ? ? ? ? ? 45 45
r
? for the wrist as shown in Fig.7(b). 
Multiple wires can be transmitted by stacking the proposed 
mechanism in parallel. The tension decoupling mechanism for 
7 wire pairs were implemented as shown in Fig.7 (a). Because 
every actuator has common rotation axes for   
1 p
? and 
2 p
?
 
motions, but a different rotation axis among the others for 
r
? 
motion. Thus, when the wrist is in 
r
? motion, some of the 7 
actuators do not only rotate, but also translate slightly up and 
down direction. Therefore, the forearm frame was designed to 
secure the room with proper guiding structure for the 
translational motions. The wrist is actuated by two parallel 
links, balls crews and motors as shown in Fig.7 (b) because the 
wrist is occupied by the tension decoupling mechanism.  
Similar to the finger mechanism, every pulley in the 
forearm and wrist mechanism has a bearing to minimize 
friction. Therefore, the implemented hand achieves high 
efficiency and backdrivability, which enable the sensitive 
contact force measurement capability by using motor current 
sensing without expensive force-torque sensors or haptic 
sensors.  
IV. FRICTION COMPENSATION 
In order to further enhance the contact force measuring 
capability, we propose an online friction compensation 
algorithm. Fig.8 shows experimental results of the frictional 
torque by measuring motor current where the blue curve and 
red curve denote the result of a grasp motor and a pose motor 
of F2, respectively. Because there was no external contact or 
gravitational effect in these experiments, this means the 
internal frictional loss. From these graphs, we can notice that 
the Coulomb friction is dominant compared to the stiction or 
viscous friction, and the amount of the Coulomb friction is not 
symmetric according to the direction. From repeated friction 
tests for the actuators, we found that the asymmetry comes 
from the actuators.  
If all the Coulomb friction parameters of the fingers are 
obtained and compensated, the contact force measuring 
capability can be improved. Fig.9 shows a schematic drawing 
describing the friction points of a finger.  The frictions of the 
DIP joint and the PIP joint were merged into a single friction 
IP
f and the frictions of roll actuator and the MPR joint also 
can be considered as one friction 
roll
f for the convenience. 
Therefore, the Coulomb friction parameters to be obtained 
for each finger are

 (totally 8), where 
IP
f and 
MPP
f denote symmetric 
Coulomb frictions of the joints, and the others mean the 
asymmetric Coulomb frictions of the actuators in both 
directions. One hand has 30 parameters because each of F1, 
F2 and F3 has 8 parameters and F4 and F5 have totally 6 
parameters considering 3 actuators for F4 and F5. The main 
challenge of the compensation is to obtain these many 
parameters easily and rapidly.   
Now let us focus on one of 3-DOF fingers. If we define a 
matrix  J as a 3?3 Jacobian matrix from the actuator speed to 
the joint speed, it has the same elements as (1) except the last 
raw. Considering the virtual work, the relationship between 
the actuator torque and the joint torque as follows:

torque exerted to the MPR, MPP and the sum of PIP and DIP 
joints. The signs (±) in (2) can be determined according to the 
rotation directions of joints and actuators. Once 8 parameters 
are obtained, (2) can be used as a friction compensation 
algorithm. For a stable compensation, an algorithm for 
compliant transmission [13] was applied. Hereafter, the 
parameter identification algorithm is explained. 
If the finger moves without external force , 
MPR

IP

on the measured actuator torques

. As the 
number of signs in (2) is 5 and in each case, the number of 
equations is 3, we can get 96 equations ( 
5
2 3? ) by changing 
the rotation directions of joints and actuators. However, in 
actual case, many of these motions are practically infeasible. 
Thus, representative motions were selected as Table I 
considering the feasibility and the enough range of motion, 
where the number of motions is 8 including the corresponding 
inverse motions. After carrying out these 8 motions, 24 
(3equations? 8 motions) equations are obtained and these can 
be expressed as a matrix form as:

Fig.10 (a) shows the experimental setup of the friction test. 
Due to a load cell with a lever, the actual contact force can be 
measured with 0.023N sensitivity. After repeated experiments, 
we obtained that the finger can detect 0.2N reliably while it 
can detect 0.74N without compensation. Fig.10 (b) shows 
snapshots of pinching test by using the proposed 
compensation algorithm. The bottle weighed 230g is placed in 
arbitrary position and the joint level impedance control was 
applied for pinching. Without the friction compensation, the 
hand failed to pinch it because the hand could not detect the 
contact properly. With the friction compensation, on the other 
hand, the hand could pinch the bottle without fail.  
The proposed compensation algorithm has an advantage 
that the parameters can be obtained rapidly by performing 
simple calibration motion as shown in Table I, which requires 
about 4 seconds. Therefore, even though the parameters have 
changed due to the change of lubrication condition or wire 
pretension, the hand can be easily recalibrated just before 
handling objects.  
V. EXPERIMENTAL VALIDATION 
Table II summarizes the specification of the RoboRay hand. 
Please note that the speed of all the joints is sufficiently high 
enough to perform agile and dexterous hand motions. The 
relatively low reduction ratio also helps achieving high 
backdrivability due to minimizing amplifications of the 
friction, damping and inertia of the motors. Most of the frames 
were made from aluminum alloy (AL 6061T6) and steel wires 
which have 7x19 constructions and 0.8mm diameters were 
used for actuation. The ball screws for the fingers and the 
wrist have 1 mm lead. 
Fig.11 shows several motions of the RoboRay hands. As 
shown in Fig.11(a)~(d) all fingers have high opposition 
capability. Fig.11(e) shows the advantage of the proposed 
MPR configuration that facilitates small object manipulation. 
Fig11(f) is a snapshots of a dynamic paper cup manipulation, 
which needs more than 400deg/sec joint speed. Fig.12 shows 
several snapshots of dual hand-arm motions. The robot 
demonstrates a manipulation of L-shaped wrench in Fig.12 (a), 
(b) and (c), where a joint space impedance control was applied 
for pinching the small object. Fig.12(d),(e) and (f) shows the 
ball manipulation motion, where an actuator space impedance 
control was applied for compliant grasping.  
VI. CONCLUSION 
A highly efficient and backdrivable robotic hand, named 
RoboRay hand, was introduced. It has 12 DOF for 5 fingers 
and 2 DOF for the wrist. The human-like size and shape, 
weight and performance enables handling the objects and 
tools for human in the human environment. By placing the

actuators according to the grasping functions, it can have the 
inherent capabilities of compliant high-power grasping and 
high precision manipulation. In order to placing high payload 
motors in the forearm without increasing friction and coupling, 
a unique tendon transmitting wrist mechanism  was developed. 
A total weight including the forearm is 1.59kg similar to 
human, and the peak fingertip force is 15N which is sufficient 
for most of household work. High backdrivability enables the 
contact force sensing by measuring motor current without 
additional sensors. It can detect the minimum contact force as 
0.196N with the proposed online friction compensation 
algorithm.  
For future research, tactile sensors will be tested and 
applied, and continuous improvements, such as contact shape 
optimization, durability improvement and water resisting 
function, will be performed.
