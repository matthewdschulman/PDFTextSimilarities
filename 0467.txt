Abstract— Internal impedance is one of the key factors
determining the quality of embodied perception and action in
biological organisms and robots. Though the role of impedance
control in robotic actuation has been well studied, its signiﬁ-
cance in the accuracy of proprioception with embodied sensors
is not well known yet. Therefore, it is important to characterize
the relationship between the entropy of sensor information and
the impedance of their physical embodiment, through which
sensors feel the internal state of the body and the environment.
In this paper, we address the role of internal impedance in
the accuracy of embodied perception. To investigate this, we
pose the problem of using only torque data measured at the
stationary base of a two link planar manipulator, to estimate the
deﬂection caused by an external torque in the McKibben type
pivot joint with variable stiffness. Based on analytical modelling
and experimental validation, this paper presents, for the ﬁrst
time, that non-linear static memory primitives relating internal
impedance, internal kinematic variables, and forces felt at the
base of the manipulator - similar to the functionality of tendon
organs of biological counterparts - can be used to tune optimal
internal impedance parameters to maximize the accuracy of
internal state estimation during external perturbations.
I. INTRODUCTION
Embodied sensing in a biological system such as
mechanoreceptors in the hand [1], are modulated by the
physical changes of the body [2]. This in-turn inﬂuences
the sensorimotor coupling network resulting in changes in
behavior [3]. For instance, as we are required to estimate the
weight of an object, we would not hold it with a stiff hand.
Instead, we bring the internal impedance of the hand to some
optimal state and gently bob the object up and down to use
proprioceptive feedback to estimate its weight. This can be
skilfully utilized to maximize information gain in sensing to
control underactuated robots. As signiﬁed in recent ﬁndings
in passive compliance of biological musculoskeletal systems
[4], control of dynamic interactions with the environment
can be simpliﬁed through its embodiment itself. Therefore,
recent ﬁndings in the emergence of adaptive behaviors of
muscular-hydrostats like octopus due to its ability to control
the stiffness distribution and morphology of the body [5],
has caught a lot of attention among the robotics research
community [6], [7].

perception through its embodied sensor can differ from that required to
take appropriate action. Taken action with an appropriate impedance could
likewise effect the quality of perception of the environment.
were ﬁrst laid down by Hogan in [8]. Hogan’s theory pro-
poses that a body in dynamic contact with the environment
should be able to adapt its internal impedance (stiffness,
damping, and inertia parameters) in order to maintain a
stable dynamic coupling with the environment. However, the
main focus of the robotics community has so far been on
internal impedance control for effective actuation than its
role in perception, especially in proprioception. For instance,
impedance control in the joint space has been achieved for
rigid body robotic digging [9], direct contact with humans in
robotic massage systems [10], companions for humans [?],
human motor rehabilitation [11], adaptive prosthetic limbs
[12], adaptive exoskeletons [13].
Robotic active perception has also attracted recent atten-
tion especially in the context of vision [14]. Though active
exploration for visual cues in the external world has been
widely studied for instance in recognition and exploration
of robot’s activities while interacting with environment [15],
active exploration in the internal impedance domain for
enhanced proprioception has not been studied so far.
Passive dynamics based locomotion is another interesting
area of research that views embodiment as a powerful
infrastructure to emerge behavior with no sensing at all.
Passive dynamic walkers presented in [16] use solely the
interaction between the walker and the environment to
emerge a metastable walking behavior. In fact, it seems
that biological evolution too solve the problem of energy
efﬁcient locomotion through tuning the embodiment to be
able to harness energy from the environment as shown
in an experiment where a dead trout swimming against a
water stream [17]. As opposed to a fully actuated robotic
ﬁsh [18]; an underactuated robotic ﬁsh that utilizes the
passive dynamics of the embodiment with single actuator
and multiple passive variable stiffness joint, is proven to
be more energy efﬁcient while being able to emerge more

In general, the implications of the embodiment concept
are mostly studied in the context of enhancing the actuation,
visual perception, or as an assistive element in granting, or
enhancing stability in locomotion. They take advantage of
passive body dynamics and the interaction with environment
to achieve the required goals without a rather high-level
cognitive processes [20].
From embodied perception perspective, a major challenge
in this study is to investigate how body’s internal impedance
can be regulated to gain the accurate perception. This paper
focuses on the role of internal impedance modulation in the
embodied perception of a simple planar 2-links manipulator
system with variable joint stiffness. The experimental results
are used to approximate the stiffness calibration curve for dif-
ferent pre-tension states of the stiffness element. We use the
transfer entropy from Kullback Leibler divergence approach
as an indicator to the information gain across pre-tension
state of the stiffness element. Newton-Raphson optimization
and Hooke-Jeeves pattern search are compared to search for
the best pre-tension state that maximizes transfer entropy to
arrive at a best estimate for angular displacement of a joint
between two links given the torque measured at the base.
This paper is structured as follows. First the experimental
platform is described, including the joint stiffness model’s
numerical simulation, followed by the methodology em-
ployed in the experiments. Thereafter, results and analysis
are exhibited. Lastly, the paper is discussed and concluded.
II. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP
A. Manipulator Platform with Variable Joint Stiffness
A design of the antagonistic manipulator used in the
experiment consists of two manipulator links - base link of
length l
1
= 15 cm, and an upper link of length l
2
= 17 cm.
The design of the variable joint stiffness in this platform is
based on the ’Mechanically Controlled Stiffness’ approach
[21].The stiffness of the McKibben type pivot joint between
these two links can be adjusted by moving the anchor point
of the two springs as shown in ﬁgure 2 and ﬁgure 3. As
depicted in ﬁgure 3, the angle  between each lever arm
and the centre of link 2 can be pre-conﬁgured; and the
springs can be preloaded by changing the position of the
anchor point. The system is mounted on a table and ﬁxed
with a clamp underneath. Apart from ball bearings, the
whole system is designed in SolidWorks and fabricated from
ABS plastic using the Dimension SST768 3D-printer. In this
experiment, we focus mainly on the perception of the angular
displacement 
2
of the upper link relative to the base link
based on the torque
f
sensed at the base of the manipulator
around z-axis using a ATI Mini40 six axis force/torque (F/T)
transducer at 100 Hz. For veriﬁcation of the accuracy of
estimating 
2
, we used an XSENS MTx wireless motion
capturing sensor sampled at 100 Hz as shown in ﬁgure 2.
B. Joint Stiffness Model
From ﬁgure 3, the distance between the axis of the pivot
joint and the anchor point of the two springs at rest is denoted

in order to ascertain the landscape of the
torque felt at the base

as a function of relative angular
displacement 

of the upper link and the pre-tension state
x of the stiffness element. From ﬁgure 4 we can note that
the level of non-linearity in this landscape tends to decrease
to almost a linear one when the angular conﬁguration of the
two lever arms  reduces.
Therefore, in order to study the role x of the stiffness
element in the information gained by measuring the torque
felt at the base 
f
to estimate 

, it is important to have
a reasonable level of non-linearity in the above relationship
shown in ﬁgure 4. In our experiments,  was set to be 55

III. EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS
The main purpose of our experiment is to examine the
role of body internal impedance in an accurate embodied
perception. In this case, we limit our study to embodied
perception during slow movements, so that a static calibra-
tion of sensors can be used in a dynamic condition as static

The relative angular displacement of the upper link and the
torque felt at the base in a static condition are denoted
by 
2
sta
and 
f
sta
respectively, and those in a dynamic
condition are denoted by
2
dyn
and

respectively. Here
we investigate as to how the non-linear relationship between

2
sta
and
f
sta
can be exploited to search for the optimalx to
maximize information gained about
2
dyn
during a dynamic
movement of the upper link (action).
A. Static Movement
As described and illustrated in section II-B, there is a non-
linear characteristic presented in our design of variable joint
stiffness. In order to identify the landscape of this nonlinear
relationship and to construct the static memory primitives for
internal state estimation, the data was recorded for 10 trials
for each conﬁguration of the stiffness element for statistic
evaluation. The static torque
f
sta
was measured at different
pre-tension states,x = 4; ; 8 cm at different
2
sta
values.
Measurements were taken after leaving the system to settle
down to a steady state (ex. after the vibrations in the springs
were damped out). For each trial, the recorded data is mapped
using a third order best ﬁt polynomial function. Figure 5 (a)
show the variability of the ﬁtted torque data across 10 trials
for each conﬁguration of stiffness element, x = 4 cm to
x = 8 cm.
The average torque proﬁle 
f
sta
, from all 10 trials is
shown in 5 (b), from which the corresponding contour
representing the non-linear static memory primitives can
be constructed. It should be noted that the experimental
results shown in ﬁgure 5 (c) is comparable to that obtained
in numerical simulation shown in ﬁgure 4 (a) (average
probability of the hypothesis that the columns of ﬁgure 5
(c) are the same as those in ﬁgure 4 (a), is statistically
signiﬁcant in Mann-Whitney U test), conﬁrming the validity
of our analytical model.
From the relationship between the torque experienced at
the base and the relative angular displacement of the upper
link, the joint stiffness, K(
2
sta
), can be obtained from the
tangent of the function of torque with respect to the angular
displacement at any given 

B. Dynamic Movement
As stated earlier, the main objective of our experiments is
to explore the inﬂuence of internal impedance on dynamic
behaviour of perception. Therefore, the dynamic torque,

f
dyn
, and angular displacement, 
2
dyn
were recorded at
different pre-tension states x, during dynamic movement.
The dynamic movement trial is carried out by releasing the
upper link from a certain angle, i.e. 
2
= 75

. Data were
recorded until the system is settled down to its steady state
where
2
= 0. An example of such movement is illustrated in
ﬁgure 6. The measured torque versus rotational displacement
trajectory is mapped using a third order best ﬁt polynomial
function as shown in ﬁgure 7 (a) for each joint stiffness
conﬁguration, x = 4; ; 8 cm.
C. Perception Information Gain with Transfer Entropy
If we consider 
f
as a random variable, its entropy for
a given 
2
depends on the pre-tension state x. Therefore,
the transfer entropy deﬁned in equation 11 - additional
information gained about the relationship between 
f
and

2
by changing the pre-tension state x - is a good indicator
to search for an optimum x [22].

D. Results: Optimization of Joint Stiffness for Perception
In this paper we compare Newton-Raphson optimization
method (requires gradient information) and the Hooke-Jeeves
Pattern search method (does not require gradient informa-
tion) to search for the bestx that maximizes transfer entropy
G to arrive at a best estimate for 

measured at the base

.
1) Newton-Raphson Optimization: Newton-Raphson op-
timization method is a technique to ﬁnd an extrema in a
solution space of a funtion based on a local gradient [23].
Figure 8 depicts this approach in ﬁnding the optimum gain

algorithm for the optimum parameter jump around across
iteration and the solution for the ’x

Search is a directional search algorithm to obtain the point
in the solution space with best ﬁtness. The algorithm was
developed by Hooke and Jeeves in 1961 and can be found
in Appendix B of their paper [24].

Hooke-Jeeves Pattern Search is suitable for only unimodal
search spaces. Handling a multimodal function with this
method may cause the algorithm to get stuck in local

internal impedance can maximize information gain in pro-
prioception by searching for an optimal stiffness under a

nonlinear relationship between the entropy of sensor in-
formation and the impedance of the physical embodiment.
In order to investigate this, we used a laboratory made
two link planar manipulator with a McKibben type pivot
joint (elbow) with controllable stiffness. Then, we posed the
problem of using only torque data measured at the ﬁxed
base manipulator, to estimate the deﬂection at the McKibben
type elbow caused by an external force at the free end.
There was a unimodal nonlinear relationship between the
transfer entropy of proprioception under varying stiffness -
determined by the pre-tension statex - of the McKibben type
pivot joint. We call it a nonlinear internal memory primitive
that the robot can use to enhance proprioception.
In this paper, we provide analytical results and experi-
mental evidence as to how we can exploit such nonlinear
memory primitives of embodiment and kinematic variables
to enhance the accuracy of the estimation of the internal
states of the system during the dynamic behaviours through
modulating the internal impedance. Transfer entropy of em-
bodied perception of the internal state - deﬂection angle of
the McKibben type pivot joint in this case - is used as an
indicator in searching for an optimal level of pre-tension
state for accurate perception. We have compared alternative
approaches to enable real-time search of the optimal internal
impedance level, namely: Newton-Raphsons Optimization;
and Hooke-Jeeves pattern search approach.
The performance of each algorithm is evaluated by the
average error in approximation of the
2
state. Hooke-Jeeves
pattern search method outperforms the Newton-Raphsons
optimization approach in term of the average error of approx-

as shown in ﬁgure 10 (a). Furthermore, though
Hooke-Jeeves optimization requires on average more itera-
tions to converge, its corresponding error deviation (shown
in error bar) is overall smaller than that of Newton-Raphson
Optimization as shown in ﬁgure 10 (b).
Based on our results, we speculate that biological counter-
parts may also be using nonlinear memory primitives similar

to the one demonstrated in this study to tune embodied
proprioception. Therefore, it would be interesting to study
whether embodiment of muscle spindles (position and speed
sensing) and tendons (force/torque sensing) beneﬁts from
some real-time internal impedance regulating strategy, and
the shapes of the corresponding memory primitives.
