REMODE: Probabilistic, Monocular Dense Reconstruction in Real Time
Matia Pizzoli, Christian Forster and Davide Scaramuzza

AbstractÑ In this paper, we solve the problem of estimating
dense and accurate depth maps from a single moving camera.
A probabilistic depth measurement is carried out in real time
on a per-pixel basis and the computed uncertainty is used to
reject erroneous estimations and provide live feedback on the
reconstruction progress. Our contribution is a novel approach
to depth map computation that combines Bayesian estimation
and recent development on convex optimization for image
processing. We demonstrate that our method outperforms state-
of-the-art techniques in terms of accuracy, while exhibiting
high efŞciency in memory usage and computing power. We
call our approach REMODE (REgularized MOnocular Depth
Estimation). Our CUDA-based implementation runs at 30Hz
on a laptop computer and is released as open-source software.

I. INTRODUCTION
We present a method to compute an accurate, three-
dimensional reconstruction of the scene observed by a mov-
ing camera and provide, in real time, information about the
progress and the reliability of the ongoing estimation process.
This problem is highly relevant in robot perception, where
cameras are valuable and widespread sensors. From a single
moving camera, it is possible to collect appearance and range
information about the observed three-dimensional scene. In
a multi-view stereo setting, the uncertainty on the depth
measurement depends on the noise affecting image forma-
tion, on the camera poses, and the scene structure. Knowing
how these factors affect the measurement uncertainty, it is
possible to achieve arbitrarily high levels of conŞdence by
collecting measurements from different vantage points. Such
a capability is particularly valuable in robotics. For instance,
if the camera is mounted on a robotic arm, the available high
level of mobility can be exploited to disambiguate scene
details and occlusions at a wide range of distances. The
monocular setting is also an appealing sensing modality for
Micro Aerial Vehicles (MA Vs), where strict limitations apply
on payload and power consumption. In this case, the high
agility turns the platform into a formidable depth sensor, able
to deal with a wide depth range and capable of achieving
arbitrarily high conŞdence in the measurement. Inevitably,
this high ßexibility comes at a cost. The pose of the camera
must be known and its accuracy inßuences the reconstruction

Fig. 1. In monocular dense reconstructions, the probabilistic approach
to depth estimation produces compact and efŞcient representations. Highly
parallelizable implementations are achieved by estimating the depth for
every pixel independently. A smoothing step is nonetheless required to
achieve robustness against noise and mitigate the effect of erroneous
measurements. Figures (a) and (b) show the result of Bayesian depth
estimation from multiple views; (c) and (d) show the same result after the
de-noising step that we propose in this paper.
quality. For a camera, information resides in the changing
of the intensity gradient and this modality naturally fails in
presence of low informative scenes that produce untextured
images. It is therefore crucial to know how reliable each
measurement is.
A. Related Work
The problem of reconstructing the scene from images
collected by a moving camera has been studied for more
than two decades and is known as Structure from Motion
in computer vision [1] and Monocular SLAM in robotics
[2]. The growing interest for dense reconstructions has
renewed the attention in multi-view stereo techniques [3],
[4], [5], [6], where the involved computational complexity
used to prevent applications in robot perception. In robotics,
the use of RGBD cameras is favouring the development
of techniques for highly-detailed [7] and spatially-extended
reconstructions [8], their applicability being limited to short
range measurements and indoor environments. The literature
in dense stereo is vast and we refer to [9] for a comparison.
However, few relevant works have addressed real-time, dense
reconstruction from a single moving camera and they shed
light on some important aspects. Figure 1 illustrates the

problem we address in this paper. If, on one hand, estimating
the depth independently for every pixel leads to efŞcient,
parallel implementations, on the other hand the authors of
[10], [11], [12] argued that, similar to other computer vision
problems, such as image de-noising [13] and optical ßow
estimation [14], a smoothing step is required in order to
deal with noise and spurious measurements. In [11], smooth-
ness priors were enforced over the reconstructed scene by
minimizing a regularized energy functional based on aggre-
gating a photometric cost over different depth hypothesis
and penalizing non-smooth surfaces. The authors showed
that the integration of multiple images leads to signiŞcantly
higher robustness to noise. A similar argument is put forth
in [12], where the advantage of photometric cost aggregation
[15] over a large number of images taken from nearby
viewpoints is demonstrated. Regularized energy functionals
also play an important role in recent methods for volumetric
reconstruction [16], [17], [18], where the three-dimensional
surface of a scene is generated by fusing several depth maps
obtained from multi-view stereo. Depending on the scene
appearance and the used stereo baselines, the computed depth
maps are potentially noisy and a robust fusion method helps
mitigate the effect of wrong depth estimations.
However, despite the ground-breaking results, these ap-
proaches present some limitations when addressing tasks
in robot perception. Equally weighting measurements from
small and large baselines, in close and far scenes, causes the
aggregated cost to frequently present multiple or no minima.
Depending on the depth range and sampling, these failures
are not always recoverable by the subsequent optimization
step. Furthermore, an inadequate number of images can lead
to a poorly constrained initialization for the optimization and
erroneous measurements that are hard to detect. It is not
clear how many images should be collected, depending on
the motion of the camera and the scene structure. Finally,
the number of depth hypotheses controls the computational
complexity, and the applicability is, thus, limited to scenes
bounded in depth.
B. Contributions and Outline
The discussed limitations are overcome by probabilistic
approaches handling measurement uncertainty. A compact
representation and a Bayesian depth estimation from multi-
view stereo were proposed in [19]. We build on their results
for per-pixel depth estimation and introduce an optimization
step to enforce spatial regularity over the recovered depth
map. We propose a regularization term based on the weighted
Huber norm but, differently from [12], we use the depth
uncertainty to drive the smoothing and exploit a convex
formulation for which a highly parallelizable solution scheme
has been recently introduced [20]. The contributions of this
paper are the following:
 a probabilistic depth map, in which the Bayesian
scheme in [19] is integrated in a monocular SLAM
algorithm to estimate per-pixel depths based on the live
camera stream;
 a fast smoothing method that takes into account the
measurement uncertainty to provide spatial regularity
and mitigates the effect of noisy camera localization.
The outline of the paper follows. In Section II we detail our
method for depth estimation from monocular views and in
Section III we provide the implementation details. Section IV
is dedicated to the discussion on the experimental evaluation.
Finally, in Section V, we summarize our contribution and
draw the conclusion.
II. MONOCULAR DENSE RECONSTRUCTION
A. Considerations
The solution we propose to compute a dense reconstruc-
tion from a single moving camera is motivated by the
following considerations.
a) A measure of uncertainty is needed in robotic per-
ception: many reconstruction pipelines previously proposed
in computer vision and graphics literature aim at providing
visually appealing maps. In contrast, we are interested in
accurately mapping the environment in order to allow robotic
tasks, such as autonomous navigation and exploration, active
perception or situation awareness in the case of human-
operated systems. As a passive sensing modality, measure-
ment uncertainty in monocular multi-view stereo is related
to the camera motion and the amount of visual information
present in the scene (e.g. texture). A probabilistic depth
map handles measure uncertainty, thus, allowing efŞcient
updating, optimal sensor placement, and fusion with different
sensors.
b) A dense reconstruction is needed to interact: sparse
visual maps based on image features have been successfully
used in robotics, e.g. to solve the SLAM problem. However,
feature deŞnitions change between sensing modalities and
tasks; dense representations are, thus, required to actually
solve the problem of registering data among largely different
vantage points based on the three-dimensional structure
[18]. When the task involves physical interaction with the
environmentÑas in obstacle avoidance, path planning and
manipulationÑthe highest achievable level of detail is de-
sirable in order to estimate the surfaces involved in the
interaction.
c) Perceptionmustbefast: differently from many state-
of-the-art systems, in order to be useful in robot perception
our pipeline must run in real-time using the robotÕs on-
board computing power. Depth estimation must be updated
efŞciently and the uncertainty in the estimation must improve
according to the information conveyed by the image and the
current camera pose.
In the designing of the monocular multi view stereo algo-
rithm, these considerations naturally bring to the formulation
of the following requirements: depth estimation must take
into account the uncertainty arising from the scene and the
camera pose and the estimation must be carried out on-
line and updated sequentially. Bayesian estimation offers
a natural way to deal with measure uncertainty, to handle
sequential measurement updates and to reject unreliable
estimations in an on-line fashion.

B. Depthmap from Multi View Stereo
We formulate the depth computation as a Bayesian es-
timation problem. Each observation provides a depth mea-
surement by triangulating from the reference view and the
last acquired view. The depth of a pixel is described by a
parametric model that is updated on the basis of the current
observation. Finally, smoothness on the resulting depth map
is enforced by minimizing a regularized energy functional.

The sequence of d

distribution that mixes a good measurement (normally dis-
tributed around the true depth
^
d) and an outlier measurement
(uniformly distributed in an interval [d

known to contain the depth for the structure of interest):

where  and

the measurements d

with p(
^
d;) being a prior on the true depth and the ratio
of good measurements supporting it. A sequential update is
implemented by using the estimation at time stepk  1 as a
prior to combine with the observation at time stepk. To this
purpose, the authors of [19] show that the posterior in (3) can
be approximated by the product of a Gaussian distribution
for the depth and a Beta distribution for the inlier ratio:

where a
k
and b

are the parameters controlling the Beta
distribution. The choice is motivated by the fact that the
BetaGaussian is the approximating distribution minimiz-
ing the Kullback-Leibler divergence from the true posterior
(3). Upon the k-th observation, the update takes the form

and the authors of [19] approximated the true posterior (5)
with a BetaGaussian distribution by matching the Şrst

for a

and 

original work in [19] for the details on the derivation.
2) Regularized Posterior: We now detail our solution to
the problem of smoothing the depth map D(u). For every
pixel u2

the k-th observation are given, respectively, by 

depth map F (u) as the following minimization:

where is a free parameter controlling the trade-off between
the data term and the regularizer, and G(u) is a weighting
function related to the ÒG-Weighted Total VariationÓ, intro-
duced in [21] in the context of image segmentation. We pe-
nalize non-smooth surfaces by making use of a regularization
term based on the Huber norm of the gradient, deŞned as:

We chose the Huber norm because it allows smooth re-
construction while preserving discontinuities at strong depth
gradient locations ([12]). The weighting function G(u) in-
ßuences the strength of the regularization and we propose to
compute it on the basis of the measure conŞdence for u:

for the speciŞc pixelu. The weighting function (8) affects the
strength of the regularization term: for measurements with
a high expected value for the inlier ratio  the weight is
controlled by the measurement variance 
2
; measurements
characterized by a small variance (i.e. reliable measurements)
will be less affected by the regularization; differently, the
contribution of the regularization term will be heavier for
measurements characterized by a small expected value for
the inlier ratio or higher measurement variance.
The solution to the minimization problem (6) is computed
iteratively based on the work in [20]. The algorithm exploits

III. IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
The monocular reconstruction pipeline is designed to run
in real time on a commodity laptop, using a CPU and a
GPU. The proposed probabilistic depth map and convex
optimization lead to highly parallel algorithms and we based
our implementation on CUDA
1
.
A. Camera pose estimation
At every time step k, the pose of the camera T
k;r
in
the depth map reference frame r is computed by a visual
odometry routine that is based on recent advancement on
semi-direct methods for camera localization [22]. The algo-
rithm operates directly on the image intensity, eliminating
1
http://www.nvidia.com
the need for costly feature extraction and resulting in sub-
pixel accuracy at high frame-rates. Three-dimensional map
points are estimated making use of the probabilistic method
described in Section II-B, which proved at the same time
highly robust, accurate and computationally efŞcient. Our
implementation is characterized by an average drift in pose
of 0:0038 metres per second for an average depth of 1
metre and a computing time of 3:3 milliseconds per acquired
image on the experimental platform detailed in Section IV.
The visual odometry algorithm is run by the CPU, and its
accuracy and efŞciency support the simultaneous execution
of the monocular reconstruction pipeline.
B. Measurement update
The parametric model in (4) is a compact representa-
tion, as it stores our conŞdence in the depth measurement
corresponding to a pixel in only four parameters: a, b, 
and . When a reference frame is taken, the estimation for
every pixel is initialized and updated with every subsequent
view. We set the initial parameters a
0
= 10, b
0
= 10,

0
= 0:5(d
min
+d
max
) and 
0
= 
max
, where 
max
is
such that 99% of the probability mass lies in the interval
[d
min
;d
max
]. Upon the acquisition of the k-th view, the
update introduced in [19] is performed for every pixel of
the reference view. We perform the update until the depth
estimation converges or diverges. At this point, we can either
consider the measurement reliable or discard it. We check
the convergence and divergence conditions by looking at
the variance of the depth posterior 
2
k
and the estimated
inlier ratio 
k
. Let 
inlier
and 
outlier
be thresholds on the
estimated inlier ratio and
thr
be a threshold on the variance
of the depth posterior. We have three cases:
 if E

[q] > 
inlier
and 
2
k
< 
2
thr
, then the estimation
has converged;
 else if E

[q] < 
outlier
, then the estimation has di-
verged;
 otherwise, the estimation continues.
The parameters
inlier
,
outlier
and
thr
control the estima-
tion convergence and can be set according to the accuracy
and robustness requirements for the application at hand.
In order to deal with higher depth ranges, we base our im-
plementation on the inverse depth [23] and use the currently
estimated variance to limit the search for correspondence on
the epipolar line.
C. Measurement uncertainty
When triangulating matched points to estimate the depth
from multiple views, frames taken from nearby vantage
points are less affected by occlusions and allow high quality
matches. On the other hand, a large baseline enables a more
reliable depth estimation but with a higher chance to incur
in occluded regions.
Referring to Figure 2, let
r
p be the current estimation of
the scene point corresponding to the pixel u in the image
I
r
. The variance on the position of
r
p is obtained by back-
projecting a constant variance of one pixel in the image I

We chose the dataset presented in [24] in order to quanti-

generated through ray-tracing from a three-dimensional syn-
thetic model. Along with each view, the related exact camera
pose and depth maps are made available. Table I summarizes
the details for the sequences used in the evaluation.
Over table identiŞes a sequence of views collected down-
looking on a desktop scenario. The sequence is characterized
by a frame rate of 30 frames per second and smooth camera
motion. The sequence identiŞed as fast motion is a collection
of views generated at 60 frames per second with large and
sudden changes of vantage point. The evaluation is based on
comparison with the ground truth depth map corresponding
to the view taken as reference in the reconstruction process.
Two depth maps are compared by computing the sum of
the per-pixel absolute difference. Since we are interested in

evaluating the depth measurements that have been identiŞed
as reliable by our algorithm, we only take into account those
measurements that have converged according to Section III-
B. We therefore use the converged measurements to create
the masks (e) in Figure 3 and Figure 5, which are used in
the comparison. We deŞne two evaluation metrics: precision,
namely the percentage of converged measurements that fall
below a certain error when compared to the relative ground
truth, and completeness, namely the percentage of ground
truth depths that have been estimated by the proposed method
within a certain error. In order to show the effectiveness
of our approach, we compare our results with depth maps
computed according to the state-of-the-art method introduced
in [19]. This work is at the basis of our probabilistic
treatment and, so far, its applicability has been demonstrated
only for reconstruction of small objects. For our comparison

and  = 0:3, and 200
iterations of the primal-dual update in (10) were run.
Figure 4 reports the result of the evaluation on the over
table sequence. Our approach is capable to recover a number
of erroneous depth estimations, thus yielding a sensible
improvement in terms of accuracy and completeness. To
verify the robustness against noisy camera pose estimation,
we corrupted the camera position with Gaussian noise, with
zero mean and one centimetre standard deviation on each
coordinate. The results show that the completeness drops.
This is inevitable due to the smaller number of converged
estimations. However, the computation of the depth map
takes advantage of the de-noising step. This trend is even
more evident in the fast motion sequence, depicted in
Figure 5. Here, according to the results in Figure 6, the

advantage of our approach is clearly demonstrated in terms
of both precision and completeness. Handling measurement
uncertainty, the probabilistic treatment of depth allows us to
select the optimal trade-off between precision and accuracy
by varying the 

In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
approach on real time reconstructions, we present our re-
sults on the City of Sights stage set [25]. We computed a
point cloud from different depth maps acquired by a single
hand-held camera. Our reconstruction pipeline was fed with
images and camera poses computed by the underlying visual
odometry (cfr. Section III-A) at 30 frames per second.
Figure 8 depicts the process of a live depth map ac-
quisition. During the reconstruction, the convergence and
divergence of estimations are displayed as a live feedback
for the user (blue and red respectively in the Şgure), guid-
ing the motion of the camera to acquire portions of the
scene for which the estimation has not yet converged or
diverged. A qualitative evaluation of the results can be drawn
from Figures 8 and 9. The minimization in (6) imposes
a smoothness constraint on the resulting surface and acts
as a prior when the estimation is uncertain. Wrong depth
computations, caused by shadows or matching errors (see
Figure 8b), cause the respective estimations to diverge (red
points in Figure 8d). The de-noising step propagates the
depth value produced by converged measurements to those
neighbours yielding low conŞdence, which are characterized
by diverged measurements. The Şnal result, in the form of a
coloured point cloud rendered from two different viewpoints,
is depicted in Figure 9.
Finally, the proposed method is suitable for real time
execution, as can be seen in Table II, where we have
reported the computing time for the evaluation sequences.
The computational cost of the proposed method is dominated
by the search for correspondences on the epipolar line. When
the motion of the camera is smooth, like in the cases of the
over table dataset and live acquisition, the region selected
for the search is small; when the camera motion forms
large baselines, then the candidate search area is wider,
affecting the computing time as in the case of the fast
motion dataset. The depth range characterizing the volume
of interest for the reconstruction also plays an important
role, as the measurement uncertainty is higher for distant
points (cfr. Section III-C). This causes the depth estimation
to require a larger number of views to converge. Nonetheless,
the estimation update runs in real time on the live 30 fps
camera stream, for a camera resolution of 752 480 pixels.
The computational cost of the optimization step depends
only on the image size and number of iterations, and is
thus constant among an evaluation sequence. Optimization
was run several times during the live acquisition, triggered
by the instantiation of new reference frames, while for the
ground truth sequences the single optimization step that is
performed motivates the 0 variance entries in Table II.
An open-source implementation, along with a video
demonstrating the reconstruction of scenes acquired by a
hand-held camera and a ßying robot, are available at the
website http://rpg.ifi.uzh.ch/software.
V. CONCLUSION
In this paper we presented REMODE, a probabilistic
approach to monocular dense reconstruction for robot per-
ception. Our method computes depth maps by combining
Bayesian estimation and recent developments in convex
optimization for image processing. We showed how a prob-
abilistic update scheme can produce a compact and efŞcient
representation of a depth map and its related uncertainty.
In order to achieve real time execution on a live camera
stream, we parallelized the computation of a depth map
by considering each pixel independently. Afterwards, we
introduced a fast smoothing step that takes into account
the measurement uncertainty to enforce spatial regularity
and mitigates the effect of noisy camera localization. We
evaluated our method in terms of accuracy and completeness,
showing a sensible improvement with respect to the current
state-of-the-art. By handling measurement uncertainty, our
method provides real time information about the progress

and the reliability of the ongoing reconstruction process. This
information is highly valuable to drive the reconstruction,
that is, to determine what views are most informative for the
task at hand.
