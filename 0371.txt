Abstract—Screw path drilling is an important process a-
mong many orthopedic surgeries. To guarantee the safety
and correctness of this process, a model-based drilling state
recognition method is proposed in this paper. The thrust force
in the drilling process is modeled based on an accurate 3D
bone model restructured by means of Micro-CT images. In
theoretical modeling of the thrust force, the resistance and the
elasticity of the bone tissues are considered. The cutting energy
and elastic modulus are deﬁned as the material parameters in
the theoretical model, which are identiﬁed via a least square
method. Some key parameters are proposed to support the
state recognition: the peak forces in the ﬁrst and the second
cortical layers, the average force in the cancellous layer and the
thickness of each layer. Based on these key parameters in the
model, a state recognition strategy with a robotic orthopedic
surgery system is proposed to recognize the switch position
of each layer. Experiments are performed to demonstrate the
effectivenessofthemodelingapproachandthestaterecognition
method.

I. INTRODUCTION
In many orthopedic surgeries, bone drilling is one of the
most important procedures for inserting bone screws [1].
As many important vessels and nerves surround the bones,
incorrect screw path drilling may cause patients irreparable
damage. Using a robotic surgery system to perform this
drilling process can help surgeons to improve their accuracy
and lower the risk.
The requirements of bone drilling are different in different
surgeries. For example, in operations with interlocking in-
tramedullary nailing, the screw path crosses the entire bone
layers [2]; while in transpedicular ﬁxation operations, the
screw path stops at the second cortical layer of the vertebral
bone[3].Therefore,torecognizethedrillingstateinthebone
drilling process, real-time thrust force feedback is being used
in robotic systems by many scholars.

Most existing studies in drilling state recognition focus
on a general model of the drilling thrust force, which is
obtained via an analysis of a large number of experiments.
Examples of this are the bone drilling systems developed
by Bouazza-Marouf and Ong from Loughborough University
(UK)[4], Louredo et al. from the University of Navarra
(Spain) [5], Lee et al. from Lunghwa University of Science
and Technology (Taiwan) [6], etc. However, these kinds of
drilling state recognition are not aimed at each single screw
path. In current clinical manual operation, surgeons will
estimate the depth of the planned screw path. This estimation
provides a previous prediction for drilling processes. Based
on this idea, Wang et al. from Beihang University (China)
developed a 3D navigation and monitoring system for spinal
milling operation based on the registration between multi-
planar uoroscopy and CT images [7]. We have proposed an
image-force fusion method for state recognition in previous
research [8]. However, the model in the approach is based on
normal CT or MR images, which can only provide the shape
of the bone without the inner microstructure of the bone.
That causes the low recognition rate between the cortical
and cancellous layers in the bone. An accurate 3D model of
the bone can help to improve the drilling state recognition.
Formodelingtherelationshipbetweenthe3Dmodelofthe
bone and operation force feedback of the drilling process, a
number of approaches for bone modeling have been present-
ed [9-11]. Agus et al. [9] propose a patient-speciﬁc volumet-
ric object model to represent the bone, and the thrust force
is presented based on the Hertz contact theory. Petersik et al.
[10] represent a bone model by volumetric pixels (voxels),
and the spherical drill bit is illustrated by an array of sample
pointsthatcoveritssurface.Amulti-pointcollisiondetection
approach is introduced in their research. Mohammadreza et
al. [11] present a voxel representation of the virtual bone,
and the drill bits are modeled as a set of small chips with an
estimated thickness and known material stiffness. The total
force is calculated by integrating all forces over all thrust
chips. These volume-based or voxel-based methods are all
built on graphic simpliﬁcation of the real structure of bones,
and they can hardly show the complex microscopic bone
structures. However, the mechanical characteristics of the
bone are signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by the inner microstructure.
Considering the above challenges, in this paper, a new
methodformodelingthrustforceofbonedrillingisproposed
based on an accurate 3D point cloud model. The 3D point
cloud model is gained by Micro-CT scanning so that the
inner microstructure of the bone remains. For modeling
the theoretical thrust force, resistance and elasticity issues

are considered. Furthermore, a model based drilling state
recognition algorithm is proposed. The key parameters in
the pre-operative model simulation are used in the intra-
operative state recognition. The experiments to demonstrate
the effectiveness of the modeling method and the recognition
algorithm are performed on a piece of lamellar pig bone.

II. DRILLING PROCESS MODELING
A. Description of Drilling Process
Inbonescrewinsertionoperations,themostimportantpro-
cess is screw path drilling in that the screw path determines
the position, orientation and depth of screw insertion. Fig.
1 shows a Micro-CT scan of a typical bone structure. Two
layers of cortical tissues cover the surface of the bone and
cancelloustissueisinside.Insomeoperations,thescrewpath
crossesallthesethreelayersandpenetratesthroughthebone.
In other conditions, like e.g. spinal surgeries, the path should
endnearbythesecondcorticallayer.Thecontrolofthedepth
in these cases is a challenge in clinical operations. However,
the real-time thrust force performs differently in cortical
and cancellous layers due to their different microscopic
structures, and can be used to recognize the different states
in the drilling process to check the correctness of the screw
path.

B. Bone Modeling via Micro-CT Images
The traditional modeling method using CT scanning can
only achieve a surface or a solid model of the bone. The
microscopic structures of the cortical and cancellous bone
are hardly present in the model [12, 13]. For bone drilling
process modeling, in this paper, a 3D model of the bone is
obtainedviaMicro-CTimagestoattaintheaccuratestructure
of the bone. The 3D point-cloud model is restructured via
the arrays of Micro-CT images. Through this process, the
microstructureofthecorticalboneandthecancellousboneis
illustrated by the distribution of the points. The point density
is higher in the cortical layer and lower in the cancellous
bone.
C. Theoretical Modeling of Thrust Force
In the drilling process, two components inﬂuence the
thrust force F
t
of screw path drilling: resistance generated
by the machining process, and elasticity from the elastic
deforming of the test bone. Equation (1) illustrates the thrust
force with the two effects, where F
c
and F
e
respectively
present the resistant and elastic components of the thrust
force, and a 2 (0,1) is the parameter to manage their ratio.

The resistance is inﬂuenced by the geometric shape of the
drill bit, the feed speed and the material parameters of the
bone [14]. The ﬁrst two inﬂuencing components are easy
to attain: the diameter and vertex angle of the drill bit are
standard, and the feed speed is previously set. However,
the material parameters are hard to acquire. To simplify the
modeling process, the cutting energy, which can be gained
through experiments in a certain rotational speed, is used to
represent the inﬂuence of the material parameters. As shown
in Fig. 2, when the drill bit gets into contact with the 3D
model of the vertebra, the cutting force is generated by (2).

The elastic component of the drilling bone is modeled by
the Hertz contact theory. The drilling process with the twist

where d is the depth of the drill bit penetrating in the bone,
and h is the height of the tip of the drill bit.
D. Parameter Identiﬁcation
The material parameters, cutting energy K and elastic
modulus E are determined by means of the microstructure
and density of the bone. They feature different properties
in different layers of the bone. To simplify the modeling
process, the material parameters are sectionally identiﬁed
in each bone layer. K = K
p1
, K
s
or K
p2
represent the
cutting energy in the ﬁrst cortical layer, the cancellous layer
and the second cortical layer. As the elastic deformation
of the bone is mainly generated in the cortical layers, the
elastic component is considered only in the cortical layers
and E = E
p1
or E
p2
represent the elastic modulus in the
ﬁrst and the second cortical layers.
Fig. 4. Boundary detection between different materials; (a) Distribution of
points along screw path; (b) Actual thrust force measurement
The bone layers are separated by means of the distribution
of the point-cloud in different layers of the bone. The density
of the point-cloud in the cortical bone is higher than that
in the cancellous bone so that the cortical bone and the
cancellous bone can be distinguished by the point-cloud
distribution along the screw path. The approach for obtaining
distributionalongcertainscrewpathisintroducedin[8].The
boundaries of each bone layer are detected with point-cloud
density thresholds. Fig. 4a shows the point distribution on
one screw path. Positions of the boundaries are recorded and
the thickness of each layer can be calculated.
The experiments with the same screw path planned in the
3D bone model are performed to gain the actual thrust force
in the real drilling process, as shown in Fig. 4b. The least
squares method is used to solve the parameter identiﬁcation,
as shown in (4).

III. STATE RECOGNITION STRATEGY
A. Key Parameters of the Simulation Force
To apply the simulation results to the state recognition,
some key parameters of the simulation thrust force are
proposed. Fig. 5 shows the simulation results of the thrust
force and the related key parameters, including the peak

B. State Recognition Strategy
In order to guarantee the safety and correctness of the
drilling process, the appropriate depth of the screw path
must be carefully determined. In our previous research with
the robotic orthopedic surgery system, an experiment-based
drilling state recognition algorithm was proposed to control
the depth of the screw path [17]. However, this previous
work on controlling the depth of the screw path is not aimed
at each planned screw path. Based on the aforementioned
model simulation and related key parameters, the drilling
states of different screw paths can be recognized in real-
time. The state recognition algorithm is described in Fig. 6.
The symbols in the following ﬂowchart are described as:

IV. EXPERIMENTS AND DISCUSSIONS
A. System Description
The experiment system for the model-based drilling state
recognition with a robotic orthopedic surgery system is
shown in Fig. 7, which includes four main hardware and
software modules: the pre-operative modeling module; the
simulation module, the robotic orthopedic surgery system
and the state recognition module.
Fig. 7. System structure of model-based state recognition
In the 3D modeling module, a Micro-CT is used to scan
andgainanarrayofimagesofthetestbone.Anda3Dmodel
in the image coordinate frame O
image
is obtained by 3D
restruction process. The test sample in the experiments is a
piece of the lamellar bone of a pig. For different screw paths
3541
on the bone, the thickness of the test bone is different, as
shown in Fig. 8a. Fig. 8b is one of the Micro-CT images,
and Fig. 8c shows the restructured 3D model.

Fig. 8. Images in different stages
In the simulation process, the prepared 3D model is
imported in the simulation module. The surgeon ﬁrst designs
the screw path in the image coordinate frameO
image
, and
thenperformsthesimulationofthethrustforceinthedrilling
process along the planned screw path. The model of the
thrust force in the entire drilling process is recorded, and
the key parameters are extracted.
The intra-operative drilling process is carried out by a
surgical robot, which consists of a 6 Degree-of-Freedom
(DoF) surgical robot, a drilling tool with a force sensor, and
a navigation system with a tracking device. The navigation
system tracks and navigates the surgical robot positioning
on the test bone. The navigation information is in the bone
coordinate frame O
bone
. In the bone drilling process, the
navigation information is gained via the planning screw path
inO
image
, therefore, a transformation matrix
bone
T
image
between O
bone
and O
image
is obtained via a point-based
registration. Then, the pre-planned screw path in the simu-
lation module is transformed into the navigation path and
sent to the surgical robot for positioning on the test bone. A
6-DoFs force/torque sensor is mounted on the drilling tool
to sense the thrust force in real-time.
In the state recognition module, the key parameters and
the real-time thrust force are imported. Based on these data,
the drilling states are recognized and fed back to the surgical
robot for control of the depth in the drilling screw path.
In all groups of experiments, the simulation force and
the actual thrust force are all inﬂuenced by the geometrical
parameters of the drill bit. A twist drill bit with diameter
of ?3mm are chosen. The feed speed is 0.5mm/s and
rotational speed is 8000rpm.
B. Modeling experiments
To demonstrate the effectiveness of the modeling ap-
proach, comparative experiments are carried out. A screw
path is designed in a model simulation. With the navigation
system, the robot moves and positions the drilling tool on
the planned screw path. The entire screw path, penetrating
the lamellar bone, is drilled and the thrust force during
this process is sensed. By comparing the simulation and
experimental force and thickness of layers, the correctness
of the 3D model can be veriﬁed. Fig. 9 shows two groups of
comparison experiments on different screw paths. The upper
ﬁgures show the model based simulation results of the path
andtherelatedkeyparameters.Theresultsoftherealdrilling
process are shown in the lower ﬁgures. The states 1, 2, 3,
4 and 5 are well recognized, and the related parameters are
obtained.
Fig. 9. Two groups of comparison results of modeling experiments
From the ﬁgures, to evaluate the precision of the model,
the thickness errors of each layer between simulation actual
thrust forces are measured and compared. The maximal
thickness error in the experiments is within 0.3mm. As
the tolerant error of the orthopedic operation is less than
0.5mm, a value which was identiﬁed through interviews
with surgeons, the precision of the 3D model satisﬁes the
operation requirements.
C. State recognition experiments
Similar to the modeling experiments, based on the pre-
vious simulation and navigation system, the drilling tool is
located on the planned screw path. To verify the result of
state recognition, the drilling process is stopped when the
drill bit reaches the switch positions. Fig. 10a and Fig. 10b
show two groups of experiments that stop at P
s3
and P
s4
,
respectively. The X-ray images show the depth of the screw
paths.
V. CONCLUSION
In this paper, the screw path drilling process in orthopedic
surgeries is focused on and a model-based drilling state
recognition method is proposed. The actual bone drilling
state recognition is combined with a previous model and
simulation.

A 3D model of the bone is restructured with Micro-
CT images which can illustrate the microstructure of the
cortical and the cancellous bone. The issues of resistance
and elasticity are considered in the theoretical modeling
of the thrust force. By ﬁtting theoretical data with trust
force in practical drilling, the material parameters in the
theoreticalmodelareidentiﬁed.Themodelofthethrustforce
and the related key parameters along certain screw paths
can be obtained. Moreover, a state recognition algorithm
based on the aforementioned model and the key parameters
are proposed and realized on a robotic orthopedic surgery
system. The recognition process combines the predicted
results from the model based simulation and the real-time
drilling.
In the test experiments for verifying the accuracy of the
modeling approach, key parameters in simulation and actual
drilling are compared. The results show that the trend of the
thrust force and the thickness of each layer are similar along
the same screw path. This demonstrates the effectiveness
of the proposed modeling method. The state recognition
experiments also verify that the model based recognition
algorithm is available for identifying the drilling states and
can be used for controlling the depth of the screw path.
Based on this work, the effectiveness of the pre-operative
planning on the 3D model can be previously predicted. And
the intra-operative operation state of each single screw path
canalsobedetectedbasedonanindividualmodeltoimprove
the recognition precision.
These are some limitations in our works. For example,
the scanning range of the Micro-CT used in this paper is too
small to scan a living human; and the scanning time is also
too long. These should be overcome in the future researches.
