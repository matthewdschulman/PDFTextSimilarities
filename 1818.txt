AbstractÑ This paper describes a simple strategy for a robot
hand to grasp and lift a deformable 3D object resting on a table.
Inspired by the human hand grasping, the strategy employs two
rigid hemispherical Þngers to Þrst squeeze the object until a
secure grip is achieved under contact friction, and then translate
vertically upward. During the squeeze, a lift test is repeatedly
conducted to determine if the maximum hypothetical liftable
weight of the object reaches its real weight. Actual lifting
follows when the test is passed. The objectÕs deformation and
conÞguration of contact with the Þngers and the plane are
tracked using the Þnite element method (FEM) in an event-
driven manner, based on varying contact displacements induced
by the Þnger movements. The gravitational force acting on the
object is accounted for. Slips inside the contact regions are
determined from solving quadratic systems. Experiment has
been conducted to demonstrate the efÞciency and accuracy for
this sensorless grasping approach.
I. INTRODUCTION
The human hand is experienced at handling soft objects
in the daily life. To pick up such an object from the table,
for instance, the hand usually squeezes it Þrst with two or
more Þngers to achieve a Þrm grip, leveraging the tableÕs
support to ensure stability. The hand starts to lift the object
at some point. During the lift, as an increasing portion of
the objectÕs weight is felt, the hand may apply some extra
squeeze to prevent slips.
Inspired by the human hand grasping, in this paper we
introduce a simple strategy for a robotic hand with no use of
tactile sensing to pick up 3D deformable objects. Two rigid
Þngers squeeze an object, and after every extra amount of
squeeze, they perform a quick test (free of physical action) to
check if the object can be lifted. Once the test is passed, the
Þngers stop squeezing to pick up the object via an upward
translation. Throughout the process, the object is constrained
by the Þngers, with or without the supporting table.
Our recent work [8], [10] investigated squeeze grasping of
deformable 2D objects as well as some optimal squeezing
strategies. One of the ideas, reßecting a key difference
from rigid body grasping, was to specify Þnger movements
rather than Þnger forces. This is because force and torque
equilibria are guaranteed over a deforming body that is fully
constrained, following the elasticity theory [5], [3]. Another
idea was to update deformation in an event-based manner
during the physical action.
Grasping deformable 3D objects differs from the 2D
version of the task in several aspects beyond just adding one
more dimension. Gravity can no longer be ignored given the
volume (and thus the weight) of a 3D object. First, it directly
affects the shape of the object as it rests on the supporting
surface. Second, when the object is being lifted, complex
interactions take place in the contact regions inside which
every contact could slide in a continuum of directions.
Like our handling of the 2D grasping task before, we
will sequence the entire operation into periods within each
of which the contact conÞguration under a Þnite element
discretization does not change. During a single period, the
displacements of the contact nodes are either known or
estimable from the Þnger movements. From them we can
uniquely determine the objectÕs deformation, which in turn
causes new change in the contact conÞguration to begin the
next period. A Þnite element analysis based on the linear
elasticity theory will be given in Section II, extending the
2D result from [8].
Section III will focus on the design of the aforementioned
pickup strategy. We will offer an iterative procedure to
compute the objectÕs initial deformation as it rests on a table,
determining the region of support. Then, we will present a
lift test to be carried out simultaneously during the squeeze
of the object by two Þngertips. Modeling of the object
deformation and the contact conÞguration during the action
will generalize over three-Þnger squeezing in 2D [10].
Section IV will describe our simulation and experiment
on four different objects in real life to validate the pick-up
strategy, in an effort to demonstrate accuracy and efÞciency
of the approach.
In this paper, we assume that the entire operation causes
small deformations of the object which can be described
within the scope of linear elasticity. Units from the metric
system will be used.
To constrain the object from any rigid body movement,
the initial Þnger placement needs to be force closure [13] on
a rigid body assuming exactly the objectÕs resting shape. For
literature on rigid body grasping, we refer to the survey [2].
On deformable body grasping, much less effort [16], [9], [7]
is known.
Within the framework of Þnite element method (FEM),
the problem of elastic contact with friction had iterative
solutions [14], [4] which updated the contact zone and
the modes of individual nodes. Our handling of contact
has a similar event-driven ßavor but takes as input contact
displacements for deformation update rather than loads under
some imposed constraints that are not always realizable.

II. DEFORMED SHAPE UNDER CONTACT
This section will begin with a brief review of linear elastic-
ity for 3D solids, and a characterization of all displacement
Þelds that represent rigid body transformations. It will then
describe an FEM formulation of deformation under gravity
and external loads. It will end with solution of the deformed
shape of a solid from speciÞed contact displacements, to
prepare for a grasping strategy to be detailed in Section III.

Theorem 1: Under linear elasticity, any displacement Þeld
(u,v,w)
T
that yields zero strain energy is linearly spanned
by the following six Þelds: (1,0,0)
T
, (0,1,0)

can establish the vanishing of all strains, i.e., ?

above yields six partial differential equations (PDEs) with
zeros on the right hand sides. Integration of the Þrst three
yields u = u(y,z), v = v(x,z), w = w(x,y). Plug them
and (1) into the last three PDEs for integration. We obtain
two equivalent forms for each of u,v,w. Further reasoning
over the equivalences will lead to

. Hence the conclusion.
The Þrst three displacement Þelds in the theorem represent
unit translations in the x-, y-, and z-directions, respectively.
The next three Þelds represent rotations about the x-, y, and
z-axes under linear elasticity, respectively.
B. The Finite Element Method with Gravity
For convenience, we assume that the object has uniform
mass density, and set the origin at its center of mass. The
FEM [6] is applied to evaluate the strain energy (2), which
generally has no closed form. Represent the solid as a
tetrahedral mesh with n vertices p
1
,...,p
n
, where p
i
=
(x
i
,y
i
,z
i
)
T
, for 1² i² n. When the body deforms, every
node p
k
is displaced by ?
k
to the location ÷ p
k
= p
k
+?
k
.
Inside a tetrahedron, the displacement of a point is linearly
interpolated over those of the four vertices. The deformed
shape is thus described by? = (?
T
1
,...,?
T
n
)
T
, referred
to as the displacement vector. The total strain energy takes
the form U =
1
2
?
T
K?, where the 3n? 3n matrix K is
referred to as the stiffness matrix. Let F = (f
T
1
,...,f
T
n
)
T
be the vector of the external forces applied at the n nodes.
We can infer from Theorem 1 that the stiffness matrix has
a null space spanned by six 3n-vectors: t
x
, t
y
, t
z
, r
x
, r
y
,
and r
z
. The Þrst three vectors describe unit translations of
all nodes along thex-,y-, andz-directions, respectively. The
next three displace every node (x
i
,y
i
,z
i
)
T
by (0,?z
i
,y
i
)
T
,
(z
i
,0,?x
i
)
T
, and (?y
i
,x
i
,0)
T
, respectively.
On the 3D solid, the gravitational force can rarely be
ignored. Under uniform mass distribution, every element has
mass proportional to its volume. We charge the elementÕs
mass evenly to its four vertices. Let the vector G gather
all nodal gravitational forces. It is easy to verify that G is
orthogonal tot

but nott

is the gravitational acceleration.
The potential energy of the system is

?
T
K???
T
(F+
G). At equilibrium, it reaches the minimum value with
K? =F +G.
The stiffness matrixK is symmetric and positive semidef-
inite. The matrix has a spectral decomposition [15, p. 273]
K = V?V
T
, where V = (v
1
,...,v
3n
) and ? =
diag(?
1
,...,?
3n?6
,0,...,0). Here ?
1
,...,?
3n?6
are pos-
itive eigenvalues corresponding to the unit eigenvectors
v
1
,...,v
3n?6
. The unit eigenvectors v
3n?5
,...,v
3n
are
orthogonalized over t
x
, t
y
, t
z
, r
x
, r
y
, r
z
using the Gram-
Schmidt procedure.
Due to the singularity of K, boundary conditions are
needed to solve K? = F +G. They will come from the
displacements of the contact nodes with the squeezing Þngers
and the supporting plane.
C. Deformation from SpeciÞed Contact Displacements
The set of contact nodes will not vary during a very small
period of squeeze on the solid by the Þngers. As in our
recent work [8] on grasping 2D objects, the starting point
of modeling is to compute the deformation of the 3D object
from speciÞed displacements?
i1
,...,?
im
of some boundary
nodesp
i1
,...,p
im
, which are supposed to be in contact with
the grasping Þngers or the supporting plane. We refer to the
set C ={i
1
,...,i
m
} as the contact index set. Zero external
forces are applied at the non-contact nodes, that is, f
k
= 0,
for k = 1,...,2n and k6?C.
Denote by ø a the vector that selects the entries from a 3n-
vectora indexed at 3i

. For instance,
ø
? = (?

T
,
which is referred to as the contact displacement vector.
We can solve for the contact force vector
ø
F and the
displacement Þeld? from
ø
? by performing a procedure
similar to the one in [8]. Substitute K = V?V
T
into
3657
K? =F +G, and left multiply both sides of the resulting
equation with V
T
. This yields the projections of? onto
v
1
,...,v
3n?6
. Let the 6-vector b gather the projections of
? onto the v
3n?5

3n
. We reconstruct? in terms of
v
1

3n
and b. Next, extract from? the expressions
for ?

and the
3m? 6 matrix B = (ø v

square matrix on the left hand side in (3). In the above
process, the displacement vector can be written as

When m = 1,2, we can easily show that B is singular.
The singularity of M immediately follows from that its last
six rows (B
T
,0) are linearly dependent.
Proposition 2: rank(B) = 6 when m³ 3 if and only if
the contacts are non-collinear.
Proof: (Sketch) Note that the column space col(B)
of B is the same as that of the matrix Q =
(
ø
t
x
,
ø
t
y
,
ø
t
z
,ø r
x
,ø r
y
,ø r
z
). Thus, rank(B) = rank(Q).
We Þrst focus on the case of three distinct contact points
p
i
,p
j
,p
k
. To determine the rank of the 9?6 matrix Q, for
l = 1,2,3 we subtract row l from rows l + 3 and l + 6.
In the resulting matrix, the Þrst three columns contain the
3? 3 identity matrix at the top and zero entries below.
We can show that, when p
i
,p
j
, and p
k
are collinear, rows
7 to 9 are scaled by the same factor from rows 4 to 6
(which are linearly independent themselves), respectively.
This implies that Q and B all have rank 5 when the three
points are collinear. The conclusion generalizes easily to
m> 3 contacts in that rank(B) = 5 when p
i1
,...,p
im
are
collinear. Geometrically, the object is free to rotate about the
line through these points.
If p
i
,p
j
and p
k
are not collinear, we can establish that
the matrix

has rank 3 via subtractions of (scaled) rows

) and (x

) are in the same direction.
Collinearity of all the m contacts implies singularity of
B and thus of M. When the m contacts are not collinear,
by a reasoning similar to that in [8], we can show that
M(
ø
F
T
,b
T
)
T
6= 0 if
ø
F6= 0 or b6= 0.
Theorem 3: The matrix M is non-singular if and only if
the m contact points are not collinear.
Therefore, when the m ³ 3 contacts are not collinear,
the system (3) has a unique solution; in other words, the
deformation is uniquely determined. We multiply both sides

III. GRASPING TO PICK UP A SOLID
Having studied deformation under contact, we move on to
consider the task of using two Þngers to pick up a deformable
3D solid on a table, which is a (horizontal) planeP. The
objectÕs initial resting conÞguration is determined from a
surface triangle?p
q
p
r
p
s
in contact withP. The vertical
projection of the objectÕs center of mass lies in the interior
of the triangle. The object deforms under gravity over the
triangle, causing the contact region to grow from?p
q
p
r
p
s
.
The Þngers have identical hemispherical tipsF
1
andF
2
for simplicity. Making contact with the resting object at the
nodes p
i
and p
j
in their current locations under gravity,
the Þngertips Þrst squeeze the object and later lift it via an
upward translation, breaking its contact with the plane.
In the current state of our work, the Þngers are assumed
to be translating during the squeeze in constant directions,
denoted by unit vectors
ö
d
1
and
ö
d
2
, respectively. Without loss
of generality, letF
1
be the moving Þngertip. For every unit
distanceF
1
translates in
ö
d
1
,F
2
translates in
ö
d
2
by s³ 0.
Thus, the squeeze action can be represented by ?(
ö
d
1
,s
ö
d
2
),
where ?³ 0 is referred to as the squeeze depth.
As? increases, the contacts will grow fromp
i
andp
j
into
regions on the Þngertips. The contact region with the plane
will also change and later shrink during the lift. Denote by
I,J,K the (varying) sets of the indices of the nodes that
are in contact withF
1
,F
2
,P, respectively. Their unionC =
I?J?K consists of the indices of all contact nodes.

uses a procedure from [11] to check ifp

of?p

would be force closure on a rigid body with
the same shape of the resting object.

If no force closure,
the object will not deform and the algorithm will fail.

Since the triangle is small, the contact is approximated by its center.
3658
Below we will Þrst describe step 2 on modeling of the
objectÕs resting conÞguration (when it is in contact withP
only), then step 4 on testing whether the object can be lifted
after some squeeze (by considering its contacts withF
1
and
F
2
only), and Þnally step 3 on squeezing the object (when
it has active contacts with all ofF
1
,F
2
, andP).
A. Initial Resting ConÞguration
Before grasping the object, we need to estimate its resting
conÞguration on the table. Clearly, I = J =? and C = K
since the object has not yet made contact with the Þngertips.
We describe an iterative procedure that computes the initial
resting conÞguration. At the start of each iteration, a node
p
k
, 1² k² n, has been displaced to the location ÷ p
k
and
receives forcef
k
if it is in contact with the plane. Let the set
P collect the indices of sliding nodes. The following steps
are carried out in the iteration.
1: P??.
2: Compute the change?

4: If no new contact node is found and, for every k? K,
f
k
is inside the friction cone, terminate the algorithm.
5: Otherwise, handle new contact if any.
6: Identify sliding nodes and add their indices to P.
7: Recompute the displacements of all sliding nodes.
In step 2, we Þx every contact node p
k
at ÷ p
k
, k?C. by
setting its change in displacement ?
?
k
? 0. The change
ø
?
?
in the contact displacement vector, which consists of all ?
?

,
k? C, is thus zero. Evaluate
ø

?
and?
?
according to (5)
and (4) after substitutions of ?

?
for ?, F ,
ø

respectively. Set ÷ p
k
? ÷ p
k
+?
?
k
, for 1²k²n, as described
in step 3.
In step 4, a new contact exists if some node on the object
would be displaced below the plane. Among all such nodes,
let p
t
be the one that is the furthermost belowP. Step 5
addsp
t
as the new contact; namely,C?C?{t}, and scale
down ?
?
t
such that ÷ p
t
+?
?
t
lies inP.
Step 6 determines if any existing contact p
k
, k? C and
k6=t, has slid by checking iff
k
is outside the friction cone.
If the condition holds, add k to P. The sliding direction of a
sliding node is opposite to the projection off
k
onto the plane.
The extra displacement ?
?
k
due to sliding is thus determined
by the sliding distance d
k
.
Step 7 evaluates

again as in step 2, this time
from the updated ?

and the table. There are|P| equations in|P| variables d

method

[1]. Move on to the next iteration.
B. Lift Test
When the squeeze depth is small, the friction between the
object and the two Þngertips is not enough to hold the object
if it is picked up. We need to perform a quick lift test in order
to check if the object can be picked up. This corresponds to
step 4 in Algorithm 1.
A straight forward strategy is to approximate the defor-
mation after the lift in one shot. We Þrst set C? I?J, as
if the supporting planeP were suddenly removed. Then,
the contact force vector and the displacement Þeld are
recomputed by specifying the displacements of only the
nodes in contact with the Þngertips. Finally, we identify the
sliding nodes. If some Þnger slides or the portion of the
sliding nodes is beyond some threshold, we consider the test
as a failure.
However, dramatic change in the contact set from C?
I?J? K and the corresponding constraints will make it
almost impossible to keep track of the sliding distances. We
need a strategy that could preserve the incremental nature
and still be interleaved with the squeezing action well.
Imagine we hypothetically increase the weight of the
object from zero. Beyond certain value w, one Þnger will
slide on the object. We call w as liftable weight. Here we
assume thatw increases continuously with the squeeze depth
?. As the squeeze goes on and ? increases, we keep track of
w(?). Initially,w(0) = 0. At each step l update w(?
l
) based
on the current contact conÞguration and w(?
l?1
). We iterate
to test w(?
l?1
)+h, w(?
l?1
)+2h, ..., until the object is no
longer liftable at some w(?
l?1
) +kh, where h is the step
size. Set w(?
l

l?1
) + (k? 1)h. Once w reaches or
exceeds the actual weight of the object, the lift test is passed.
Otherwise, more squeeze is needed. And the lift test fails.
Since the test is repeated for every small increment in ?,
small change takes place which avoids the loss of tracking
sliding distance.

directions.

the modiÞed (5) and (4).
There are four events: contact establishment (A), contact
break (B), stick-to-slip (C), and slip-to-stick (D). The contact
index setsI,J,K do not change until the next event. Event A
is detected when a node is to penetrate into F

P. Event B happens when the contact force at a node is
pointing outward from the object. Event C takes place when
the contact force at a node is out of its friction cone. Event D
occurs when the change rate of the sliding distance of some
node in terms of ? becomes zero.
Between two events, the movements of all sliding nodes
need to be tracked. Their indices are collected in the setP. If
p

slides in the planeP, its sliding distance d
k
is a variable
as described in Section III-A.
The situation that p

quadratic equations in the forms of (6), (7), or (8) in the same
number of variables. Solve the system to update all contact
slips using the homotopy continuation method.
Instead of combining the above system with the condition
for each event test to determine the next squeeze depth at
which an event happens, we take small increments in the
squeeze depth and check after each increment if any event
happens. Upon such an occurrence, we can use NewtonÕs
method to polish the corresponding squeeze depth value. The
contact index sets I,J,K,P are updated accordingly.
In step 5 of Algorithm 1, once the lift test is passed,
the two Þngers translate upward. During the lift, the nodal
contacts with the planeP will break gradually, and some
contacts with the Þngertips could also break under gravity.
Modeling, however, is no different from that of squeezing.
If all the contact nodes on one Þnger are sliding, the object
slides on the Þnger and the pickup fails. Otherwise, the
pickup is a success when the object leaves the plane.
IV. SIMULATION AND EXPERIMENT
Simulation was done on a PC with Intel Core i7-3770 Pro-
cessors and 8 GB system RAM. Experiment was carried out
to validate Algorithm 1. A triangular mesh for every object
used in the experiment was Þrst acquired by a 3D scanner
from Next Engine, Inc., and then simpliÞed using MeshLab
(http://meshlab.sourceforge.net/). The genera-
tion of tetrahedral meshes and transformation of the objects
were implemented using Computation Geometry Algorithm
Library (http://www.cgal.org).
Table I listed the parameters of four deformable objects,
shown in the Þrst row of Table II, which were used in
experiment: w is the weight of the object, E is the YoungÕs
modulus, ? is the PoissonÕs ratio, and ? is the coefÞcient of
friction.

Table II shows successful pickups of four objects. The

Two Þngers of Barrett Hand equipped with hemispherical

Once the liftable weight determined by lift test exceeded
the weight of the object, the Þngers switched the action to
lifting. The third row shows the four objects picked up by
the Barrett Hand driven by Algorithm 1. The fourth row

shows the corresponding simulation results. The last row lists
the relevant values: number of contact nodes in the Þnal
conÞguration, squeeze depth ? before lifting, and running
time(s) of the simulation for prediction.

Also, we compared the grasping results with those of
grasping four rigid bodies that have identical shapes of the
four objects in Table II. Table III shows the total normal force
needed to balance the gravity and pick up an object in both
cases. The comparison shows that picking up deformable
objects takes less effort than rigid bodies. This is mainly
because that smaller normal force is needed to generate
enough friction for deformable objects due to increased
contact area under deformation.
V. DISCUSSION AND FUTURE WORK
We have described a simple squeeze-and-lift strategy for
grasping 3D deformable objects. The idea is to model
changes in shape and contact geometry during the action,
and repeatedly conduct lift tests to predict when to switch
the action from squeezing to lifting. To support the modeling,

we have extended our contact-based Þnite element analysis
to 3D, with gravity taken into account. Contact slips are
handled via root Þnding of quadratic systems derived under
CoulombÕs friction law and linear elasticity.
The next step is to obtain more understanding about
several factors that contribute to a successful pickup: global
shape, geometry of contact regions, normal vs. tangential
contact forces in balancing the objectÕs weight, etc. Experi-
ment on same shape with different softness and objects with
complex geometry will be conducted.
In the near future, our efforts will be on optimizing
Þnger placements and squeezing directions, and turning the
operation into a reactive one by incorporating tactile data in
the modeling for reliable slip detection/prediction.
