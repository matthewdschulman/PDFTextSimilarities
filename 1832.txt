Supernumerary Robotic Limbs for Aircraft Fuselage Assembly: Body
Stabilization and Guidance by Bracing
Federico Parietti and H. Harry Asada, Member, IEEE
Abstract— A new type of wearable robot that assists the
wearer with extra arms secured around the hips is presented.
Supernumerary Robotic Limbs (SRL) can hold objects, clamp
them to a ﬁxture, guide and support human hands, and assist
the wearer in performing a task as a close co-worker. This
paper focuses on a class of tasks where SRL physically interacts
with the environment through contact. SRL makes contact
with a wall and thereby braces the human body against the
environment. SRL also guides the human hands by placing a
drill jig over the drilling location. Bracing the human body
and guiding the hands, SRL can enhance the drilling task
stability and accuracy. The SRL technology is applied to
aircraft assembly, where conventional industrial robots failed
to perform effectively.
First, the basic design concept of SRL is summarized, and
task strategies using SRL and their functional requirements are
described. Kinematic and static properties resulting from the
structural closed loops formed around the SRL, the human,
and the environment are analyzed, and effective strategies
for physical disturbance rejection and ﬁne positioning are
discussed. A prototype robotic arm grasps the aircraft fuselage
structure. Another robotic arm places a drill jig precisely on
the fuselage structure, and guides and stabilizes a hand drill
held by the human user. An optimization method is developed
in order to identify the SRL kinematic conﬁguration and joint
torques that stabilize the drill and at the same time minimize
the human workload.
I. INTRODUCTION
Imagine that one-day humans have a third arm and a third
leg attached to their body. The extra limbs will help them
hold objects, support the human body, share a workload, and
streamline the execution of a task. Supernumerary Robotic
Limbs (SRL) secured around the hips represent one type of
co-robot having an intimate relationship and highly coordi-
nated activities with the human [1] [2] [3]. The robot-on-
the-human approach has the potential to change the standard
of manual labor; productivity and work quality may be
improved, fatigue and injury may be reduced, and human
mistakes can be minimized.
The development of SRL was motivated by the needs of
the aircraft manufacturing industry. Aircraft manufacturing
is largely dependent on manual labor due to the complexity
of tasks, stringent inspection requirements, difﬁculties in
installing a conveyor line, and small lot size. In a typical
aircraft assembly factory, a number of scaffolds are used to

Developing such special robots that can climb up a large
aircraft body remains a technical challenge [4]. Although
special mobile robots can be developed for the future, manual
labor cannot be eliminated and scaffolds will remain, which
may interfere with the mobile robots.
These problems in aircraft manufacturing motivated the
authors to explore a new approach to bringing robots to the
type of environment where a) the site is difﬁcult for robots to
access, and b) works are predominantly performed by manual
labor, and are difﬁcult to eliminate. While exploiting the
superb human abilities, including mobility, ﬂexibility, task
knowledge, and manipulative skills, supernumerary robotic
limbs can supplement the human’s limitations and improve
productivity and efﬁciency.
Exoskeletons have been studied for extending the human
ability of muscular works since the early development at
General Electric (Hardiman, 1960s) [5], and more recently
extensive works have been conducted [6] [7] [8] [9]. The
SRL is fundamentally different in kinematic structure and
functionality. Unlike exoskeletons, the SRL has independent
manipulators and extra legs that are not attached to the
human arms and legs for strengthening the corresponding
joints. Instead, the robotic arms branch out from the human
body, and take an arbitrary conﬁguration. Contacting various
surfaces and bracing the body against a wall, rails, and the
ﬂoor allow the SRL to effectively support the human body
and provide a variety of function beyond load bearing.
The current work explores a promising application for
the SRL’s bracing functionality. The SRL can provide the
human with positional references, jigs, and tools for assisting
the human in executing tasks that require high accuracy or
robustness to disturbances. For example, a SRL carrying
a drill jig can place the jig at a desired position, guide a
hand drill held by a human worker, and stabilize the drilling
operation. Exploiting bracing for stabilization and guidance
requires strategic task analysis and synthesis. The kinematic
and static behaviors of the SRL and the human are complex,
forming kinematic loops due to bracing. In the following, we
will model the SRL system and formulate a task synthesis
problem where the robot arm posture, bracing positions, and
robot joint torques will be optimized.
II. APPLYING THE SRL TO AIRCRAFT FUSELAGE
ASSEMBLY
Figure 1 shows a typical assembly task inside a large
aircraft fuselage. A beam, called inter-coaster, is placed
between two vertical frames, and secured with special bolts.
This assembly task requires many steps of operations, in-
cluding picking up a workpiece, positioning it against the
fuselage frame, clamping the workpiece to the fuselage,
making holes with a drill, installing bolts, and fastening the
bolts. Currently, the work is executed completely by human
labor. For complex installation two workers must collaborate
to complete the job.
This task procedure can be streamlined with the use of
the SRL. Figure 1 shows a prototype SRL system developed
at the MIT d’Arbeloff Laboratory. It consists of two 4 DOF
robotic limbs, a waist bracket for securing the robot around
the waist, and end-effectors attached to the tip of the arms.
The SRL system is equipped with a motion capture system
placed above the backpack frame. One SRL may be equipped
with a clamp at its end point, as shown in Figure 1, and
secure the beam temporarily against the fuselage structure,
rather than the human picking up and setting the clamp. Then
the human can immediately move on to drilling. Another
SRL can assist the human in positioning the drill against
the frame. As shown in Figure 1, the second SRL may be
equipped with a drilling jig at its end point, and place it
precisely at a speciﬁed position by using proximity sensors
at the tip or other types of sensors detecting the location of
the fuselage structure. Furthermore, the drilling jig can keep
the drill bit perpendicular to a beam surface and guide it to
the exact location where a hole must be made. The human’s
work load is substantially reduced, since his/her job is simply
pushing the drill towards the surface, i.e. 1 DOF motion. The
SRL with the drilling jig can support the drill in other 4 DOF:
x and y translations and pitch and yaw rotations.
In this example task, the ﬁrst SRL clamps the beam against
the fuselage structure. Note that, in turn, the human body is
physically constrained by the SRL connecting the human
body to the fuselage. In other words, the human body is
braced against the fuselage structure. This can secure and
stabilize the human body while performing the laborious
task. Assembly tasks of a large aircraft fuselage are often
performed in an unsecure environment with only partially
covered ﬂoors. Bracing the human body will contribute to
stabilizing the body and improving safety.
In the drilling task considered in this study, the SRL has
two goals. The ﬁrst one is to indicate the correct hole location
to the user. This is achieved by placing the drill jig on
the aircraft frame surface, so that its central bushing will
guide the drill bit towards the desired position. Using the
motion capture system and endpoint feedback control, the
SRL is able to position the bushing more accurately than an
unaided human worker, guaranteeing also task repeatability.
The second goal of the SRL is to hold the drill jig in
place during the drilling process. This anchoring phase is
critical, because the bushing must be ﬁxed to the hull
surface despite the presence of several potentially large
disturbing forces. The main perturbations are the human-
induced disturbances (involuntary movements, postural sway,
breathing), the vibrations produced by the drill, and the
unwanted force components (perpendicular to the dilling
axis) that the worker may generate while pushing the power
drill.
Since the drill jig has no gripper, it can be anchored to
the hull in only one way: by pressing it on the aircraft
wall with a force which is perpendicular to the contact
surface. This perpendicular force will then generate static
friction components which will be able to absorb distur-
bances parallel to the contact surface, as long as they are
within the friction cone. This drill jig anchoring strategy
has several advantages: ﬁrst, the robot does not need any
pivots or special features to hold on to. The drill jig is

simply put in contact with the surface that needs to be drilled,
on the desired location. Another advantage is the very fast
and reliable engaging/disengaging process. The anchoring is
realized by reaching the desired contact force, and is quickly
released by moving the end effector away from the aircraft
hull. No complicated end effector or grasping systems need
to be used, making the holding system more reliable. In the
following section, we will present three strategies to generate
a perpendicular holding force and secure the drill jig during
the drilling task.
III. DRILL JIG ANCHORING STRATEGIES
The main challenge presented by the drilling task is how
to minimize the human effort while producing the required
holding force at the drill jig. The base of the SRL is the
human hip. This means that if the robotic conﬁguration
is unbalanced, the human must exert a restoring hip force
in order to keep his/her position. The goal of the SRL is
therefore that of generating a large drill jig contact force,
while minimizing the required human workload. This can be
achieved by using the free SRL arm (the one without the drill
jig) to contact the environment in a convenient location. This
SRL arm can then generate ground reaction forces aimed to
secure the drill jig and relieve the human.
The structure of the problem is as follows (see Figure 2
and Table 1). The position of the SRL base (human hip) and
the position and orientation of the drill jig are known. They
are given parameter values determined by the task (hole that
must be drilled) and by the current worker position. The
goal of this analysis is to determine the best point where the
free SRL arm must make contact with the environment. We
also want to ﬁnd the SRL joint torques that will originate
the required drill jig anchoring force, while minimizing the
human workload. Table I summarizes the parameters and
unknowns of the problem (refer also to Figure 2).
A. Basic Strategy
The simplest drill jig anchoring strategy consists of gen-
erating with the free SRL arm a force which is equal and
opposite to the holding force required at the bushing (Figure
3). In order to maintain static balance, the system needs a
compensation torque 
C
.

C
=f
AR
d (1)
This torque can be provided by the SRL wrists (they are
in contact with the environment and can therefore shape the
ground reaction torques). If 
C
surpasses the limits of the
robot wrists, the exceeding part must be generated by the
human hip.
The compensation torque 
C
depends on the magnitude
of the holding force f
AR
– which is a ﬁxed parameter of
the problem – and on the distance d between the holding
force axis and the parallel axis passing through the other
contact point (Figure 3). In order to reduce 
C
, this strategy
requires reducingd. It is very convenient when it is possible
to place f
AR
and f
AL
on the same axis. In most cases,
however, reducingd entails decreasing the distance between
the two robotic end effectors. This would place both robotic
hands in the drilling area, creating unwanted obstacles to the
movements of the worker. It is therefore necessary to develop
an anchoring strategy that allows the SRL to generate the
drill jig holding force without invading the drilling area.
B. Leaning Strategy
For a human, generating a strong continuous hip torque is
uncomfortable and causes fatigue. In fact, this requires the
constant contraction of the hip muscles. Conversely, for a
standing human is simple and effortless to generate a static
linear force in the horizontal plane. This can be achieved
by leaning in the direction where the force must be created.
Using the Linear Inverted Pendulum Model [10], this leaning
force can be expressed as F

It is therefore possible to develop a drill jig anchoring
strategy that constrains the human compensating force to
be exclusively linear. The considered situation is shown in
Figure 4: in order to generate the holding forcef

to use a robot contact forcef

Since d
R
is ﬁxed (it depends on the given drilling and
human locations), the hip forcef
C
provided by the user can
be reduced by increasing as much as possible the distance d
between the two robotic end effectors. This is an advantage
of the current strategy, because it means that the free robotic
arm does not obstacle the movements of the worker in the
vicinity of the drilling location. However, the limit of this
strategy is that the required human forcef
C
is still large. In
other words, the human effort is comparable (for admissible
values of d and d
R
) to the anchoring effect that we want
to achieve. Moreover, the human can generate only the y
component of f
C
by effortlessly leaning forward. There is
thus the need for a general drill jig anchoring strategy, able to
identify the general ground reaction forces and torques that
realize the desired holding force while minimizing human
workload.

, while maintaining the system
in static equilibrium. Section IV will present an optimization
technique to select the most convenient solution, and use its
results to identify the best robot conﬁguration.
It is important to point out that the results of this section
hold in general for any wearable robot that has two contact
points with the environment. These results do not depend on
the speciﬁc number of links or joint types of the wearable
robot. The kinematic structure of the robot will come into
play when determining the necessary joint torques (Section
V).
IV. OPTIMIZATION
The system found applying the general drill jig anchoring
strategy has inﬁnite solutions. The optimal solution is the one
which minimizes the user workload required to anchor the
drill jig. The human workload is determined by the forces
and torque that the hip must exert in order to keep the system
in static balance:F
xC
,F
yC
,
C
. In this analysis, we include
all of these values in a single scalar measure of human
workload: the compensation energyE
C
. This quantity is the
equivalent energy that the human hip would have to provide
if it was a passive element composed by three springs (two
linear and one rotational). The deﬁnition ofE

The values of the three hip spring constants can be adapted
from the biomechanical literature [11]. When a human is

assuming small displacements (leg lengthL

Since the goal of the optimization is to ﬁnd the solution

the only elements with relevant weights are the ones that
determine E

This solution contains the ground reaction forces and
human hip forces that anchor the drill jig to the ground,
while minimizing the human workload. The linear system
on which the solution is based (equations 4-6) was derived
assuming that the contact point of the free SRL arm (a
L
,
b
L
) was ﬁxed. It is therefore possible to repeat the same
optimization for every contact point within the workspace of
the SRL. The results (optimalE
C
that can be achieved given
a particular contact point) are visualized in Figure 5.
In a manufacturing environment, though, the number of
available contact points is limited. The free robotic arm can
only make contact with the environment in the intersection
between the aircraft structure surface and its workspace.
Such a situation is represented in Figure 6. When limited
contact points are available, the ground reaction forces (and
associated optimal E
C
) are calculated only for those points.
The best overall ground contact is then the one that yields
the smallest optimal E
C
(see Figure E
C
).

optimal contact points, outlined with dot markers, are the ones that minimize E

. The magenta and green SRL conﬁgurations in A) and B) correspond
to these two minima.
The general anchoring strategy, combined with the op-
timization method described above, is able to select the
most convenient SRL conﬁguration because it does not
pose any constraints on the ground reaction forces (unlike
the basic strategy and the leaning strategy). Figure 7 and
Table II visualize two optimal SRL conﬁgurations, with
their associated ground reaction forces and hip forces. It is
evident that the anchoring force is generated by the robot
with negligible human effort (small F
xC
, F
yC
and 
C
).
Table II reports the ground reaction forces and hip forces
in the two optimal cases (see also Figure 7). It also shows
the coordinates of the optimal ground contact points.
V. DISCUSSION
The optimization process described in the previous section
determined the SRL conﬁguration and external forces that
anchor the drill jig to the aircraft while minimizing human
workload. We now ﬁnd the robot joint torques that must be
applied in order to realize the optimal static equilibrium. The
values of the ground reaction forces and torque are known
for both robotic arms. These values are either contained
in the vector x
opt
or can be determined from the problem
parameters (F

Knowing the ground reaction forces (equal and opposite to
the end effector forces) allows us to write the following
expressions for the joint torques

The same expression is applied also to the other robotic
arm (with subscriptR).J

andJ

are the Jacobian matrices
of the two SRL arms in the kinematic conﬁguration that
corresponds to x
opt
.
Up to this point, we did not make any assumption on the
particular structure of the wearable robot. These results hold
for any wearable robot with two end effectors (the drill jig
and a gripper). In the case of the SRL prototype (Figures 1
and 2), the robotic arms have 3 degrees of freedom in plane
xy.
The solution for the joint torques 
L
and 
R
is unique.
The SRL joint torques for the two considered conﬁgurations
(magenta (1) and green (2), see Figures 6 and 7) are reported
in Table III. If the robotic arms had a different number or type
of actuators, the Jacobian matrix would change accordingly.
The optimization method presented in this study does not
take explicitly in account the limitations to the joint torques,
or to the electromagnets gripping force. If the maximum
values of these quantities are surpassed, the drill jig holding
force must be decreased until all constraints are met.
The results shown in Section IV conﬁrm that the General
Strategy is superior to the Basic and Leaning Strategies. The
general method always minimizes the human workload, for
any environment proﬁle. The examples reported in Table
II and III show that the human workload is one order of
magnitude less than the holding force exerted on the drill
jig. Conversely, the other two methods are effective only in
particular situations (gripper close to the drill jig for the basic
strategy, and gripper far from the drill jig for the leaning
strategy) and require high human workloads in the other
cases. The basic and leaning strategies can be viewed as
particular cases of the general strategy, which the optimiza-
tion algorithm will select if their particular conditions are
met. This is evident in the case of conﬁguration 2 (Figure

Fig. 7. Visualization of the ground reaction forces and human hip forces in the two optimal conﬁgurations identiﬁed in Section IV (see also FIgure 6).
The points and forces are deﬁned in Figure 2. The length of the vectors is proportional to the magnitude of the forces and torques (see box for scale).
Conﬁguration 2 achieves the minimum possible E

given the available points. It also requires smaller joint torques on the SRL joints (wrist torques
plotted; for the other joints, see Table III).

which is
similar in magnitude but opposite in sense (compare with
section III.A).
The optimization method can also be adapted to com-
pensate for the weight of the SRL. In this case, it sufﬁces
to modify system Ax = b by imposing the value of

= mg (F
xC
becomes a ﬁxed parameter). This way,
the optimization algorithm will ﬁnd the SRL conﬁguration
and joint torques that anchor the drill jig, compensate for the
weight of the machine, and minimize the user workload.
VI. CONCLUSIONS
The Supernumerary Robotic Limbs (SRL) are two wear-
able robotic arms that augment the skills of their human
user, enabling the execution of complex or fatiguing tasks
that would normally require the collaboration of two or more
workers. The SRL has been designed to address the needs
of the aircraft manufacturing industry, where productivity
is limited by difﬁcult tasks and an aging workforce. Our
vision for the SRL is to become a functional extension to the

human workers, conjugating robotic accuracy and strength
with human intelligence and adaptability.
In this paper, we focused on a drilling task where the
goal of the SRL is ensuring that the hole respects positional
and orientation tolerances despite the presence of disturbance
forces. This is achieved by using a drill jig equipped with
a central hole (bushing). Once the robot has positioned and
anchored the drill jig on the aircraft surface, the worker uses
the bushing to guide the drill bit. The anchoring effect is
achieved by pressing the drill jig on the surface of the aircraft
structure.
The results presented in Section IV and V show that the
SRL is effective in aiding the user during the considered
drilling task. Our algorithm is able to select the optimal robot
conﬁguration given a limited number of available contact
points with the environment. The algorithm can identify the
ground reaction forces that secure the drill jig to the aircraft
structure, while minimizing the human workload. It also
computes the joint torques necessary to create the desired
static equilibrium.
This paper demonstrated a novel application for wearable
robotic arms that are kinematically independent from the
user. The SRL is free to select the conﬁguration and joint
torques that are most effective in assisting the user during a
drilling task.
