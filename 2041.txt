Low-cost Fingertip Sensor for Robotic Manipulation
Zhe Xu, Svetoslav Kolev and Emanuel Todorov
Abstract— We describe a low-cost 3-axis ﬁngertip force
sensor for robotic manipulation. Our design makes the most
of 3D printing technology, and takes important factors such
as maintainability and modiﬁcation into consideration. The
resulting sensor features a detachable ﬁngertip made of 3D-
printed materials, and a cantilever mechanism that allows
the detection of contact forces via three off-the-shelf, low-cost
force sensors. To improve our design concept, optimization on
the conﬁguration of the ﬁngertip sensor is performed under
statistical analysis of the hysteresis performance. The optimized
ﬁngertip sensor is experimentally investigated and calibrated.
At the end, through a case-study, we demonstrate that our
proposed design can measure the direction of contact forces in
the radial plane of the ﬁngertip sensor.
I. INTRODUCTION
During manipulation and exploration tasks, robotic
hands/grippers are often required to respond effectively to
unknown objects and obstacles. Without detailed models
of the operating environment, real-time measurement of
the contact force is essential for the success of a robotic
hand/gripper to perform dexterous tasks. As thoroughly
summarized in a recent review [1], many different types
of force/torque sensors have been developed over the past
decade in order to equip the robotic hands with the tactile
sensing ability in various applications.
When it comes to choosing the suitable ﬁngertip sensors
for a robotic hand/gripper, besides taking into consideration
the sensing ability, the cost still plays an important role. So
far, high-end ﬁngertip sensors have been widely employed by
many advanced robotic hands [2]–[5]. However, the cost of
those sensors accounts for large portions of the robotic hand.
The price of a commercially available 6-axis force/torque
sensor starts at $2000. Although the performance of those
advanced tactile/force-torque sensors are very appealing,
there also exist situations where the researchers have to
comply with their limited budgets on ﬁngertip sensors and
would like to reasonably relax the sensing requirement.
Durability and maintainability are the other two parame-
ters that were often ignored during the design of ﬁngertip
sensors. The skin of the human hand can regenerate itself,
and therefore normal wear and tear won’t cause permanent
damages to sensing modalities. The increasing roles of robots
in human environments require robotic hands to be operated
in harsh conditions where a ﬁngertip sensor may be exposed
to corrosive chemicals, metal objects with sharp edges, and

coarse surfaces of certain objects that can all cause severe
damages to the ﬁngertip sensors beyond the normal repair.
However, most of existing ﬁngertip sensors have either
embedded sensing elements [6] at the contact region or
layered ﬂexible circuit [2], [7] under the elastic materials
of ﬁngertips. These features can potentially raise the risk of
broken sensors. Therefore, important factors such as low-
cost, maintainability and durability have to be taken into
consideration during the design of future ﬁngertip sensors.
In recent years, many researchers have started using 3D-
printed parts directly for their robots, or sometimes fabricat-
ing the entire working prototype using only 3D printed parts
with a few fasteners [8], [9]. 3D-printed molds and frames
were also developed for making different soft skin textures
[7], [10], [11]. Therefore, it is of our interest to investigate
the possibility of designing and fabricating a 3D-printed
ﬁngertip sensor, and to understand essential characteristics
that may potentially affect the performance of ﬁngertip
sensors.
To this end, we describe a ﬁngertip sensor that makes the
most of the appealing features of low-cost force sensors, in-
novative mechanism, and 3D-printing technology. In contrast
to conventional approaches, our proposed design moves the
sensing components away from the contacting areas to the
base of the ﬁngertip and keeps only the low-cost, compliant
ﬁngertip for direct contact with objects. These changes can
potentially reduce the cost, allow more task-oriented design,
and make the maintenance of the ﬁngertip sensors easier than
using complicated/expensive sensors.
In the following sections, the design concept of the ﬁn-
gertip sensor is explained, the important components are
detailed, and then we optimize the conﬁgurations of our
proposed ﬁngertip sensor based on the hysteresis analysis.
An optimized ﬁngertip sensor is then used for calibration. At
the end, based on what we learn from the 3D-printed ﬁngertip
sensor, we demonstrate a case study of our proposed design
adapted to a robotic manipulation task with little modiﬁcation
efforts.
II. DEVELOPMENT OF THE FINGERTIP SENSOR
This section describes the working principle, the mechani-
cal structure, and the electronic components of our proposed
ﬁngertip sensor.
A. Sensor description and the working principle
As shown in Fig. 1, the working principle of the ﬁngertip
sensor is based on a cantilever mechanism. The ﬁxed end is
located at the bottom of the base; the free end is attached

to the bottom of the ﬁngertip through a central steel ball.
The central steel ball is then supported by three symmetri-
cally arranged Honeywell FSS015WNSX force sensors (FSS
sensor hereinafter) via three pairs of sphere contacts. The
three FSS sensors are placed at the inclined opening of the
well structure of the base. The external forces applied at the
ﬁngertip will result in a combined reaction force from the
three sensor balls and get detected by three FSS sensors.
As represented as a beam structure in Fig. 1, important
parameters that are related to manipulation task contains the
radius (r) and the height (h) of the ﬁngertip. The diameter
of the central steel ball decides the size of the base structure
which is designed to not have contact with external objects,
and therefore won’t be considered as a design parameter.
Additionally, because the exposed surfaces of the central
steel ball and three sensor balls are all plated, the contact
between them can be retreated as frictionless sphere contacts,
thus the sensor reading should mainly reﬂect the change from
the normal forces (F
1
, F
2
, and F
3
) at the contact sites.
B. Mechanical design of the ﬁngertip sensor
As shown in Fig. 2, our proposed ﬁngertip sensor is
composed of ﬁve components, namely, a ﬁngertip (can be
coated with silicone rubber), a plated central steel ball, a
force sensor enclosed base, a cantilever-bolt mounted bottom
cap, and three FSS force sensors. Except for the extended
cantilever-bolt (a M2.5 steel screw), the central steel ball (9.4
mm in diameter) and the FSS sensors, all the other parts were
3D printed by the Dimension BST 768 (Stratasys Corp., Eden
Prairie, MN) within one hour.

The Honeywell FSS sensor is powered by 5V DC source.
Its output is then fed into an instrumentation ampliﬁer
LT1920 from Linear Technologies, where the signal is dif-
ferentially ampliﬁed by a factor of 5. The output is fed to
a NI-DAQ PCI 6229 card where it is digitized as shown in
Fig. 3. And the detail speciﬁcations of the FSS sensor are
listed in Table I.

III. DESIGN OPTIMIZATION OF THE FINGERTIP SENSOR
According to the factory’s speciﬁcation, the performance
of the Honeywell FSS sensor is very good (as detailed in
Table I), and therefore they are often adopted by medical
devices [12]. However, due to the special structure we
adopted for our design, once the three FSS sensors are
installed inside the ﬁngertip sensor, the central steel ball
would exert compression force through the three contacting
balls of the FSS sensors. It is of interest to understand
how the FSS sensors behave under pre-loading. Besides, the
overall performance of our proposed ﬁngertip sensor relies
heavily on its mechanical design. Important factors such
as the friction between the central steel ball and the three
sensor’s contacting balls, and the elastic behavior of the ABS
plastic used for 3D printing can all be greatly affected by the
conﬁgurations of the ﬁngertip sensor. In order to investigate
how the mechanical design will affect the performance of our
proposed ﬁngertip sensor, we conducted hysteresis analysis
with respective to two groups of forces (G1-type and G2-
type) under six different rotational conditions as illustrated
in Fig. 4.
At the beginning of each loading test [13], a small tray
was hanged from the ﬁngertip (ath1:::h9 orr1:::r5) through
a pair of strings. The tray and strings weigh 5 grams in
total. During the experiments, known weights were added

and removed from the tray manually, and force readings
from the FSS sensors were recorded by NI DAQ PCI-6229 at
2KHz. In order to obtain the hysteresis curves we initialized
the ﬁngertip sensor with the empty tray. We then successively
added weights to the tray so that we obtained measurements
at different weights. After that we removed the weights in the
reverse order. After each addition/removal we waited until
the weight stabilized and marked the time in our recording
with the corresponding weight. We then averaged the values
from the 3 seconds after the time marker and treated that
number as the voltage output of the sensor under the loaded
weight.
Group 1 and group 2 each have distinctively nine and ﬁve
testing locations. And for every testing location, loading and
uploading experiments were conducted with eight different
weights. The information of the tested ﬁngertip sensor is
listed in Table II. Examples of processed data are as shown
in Fig. 5. Due to the small non-linearity effects found from
the data, we chose to use the following, simpliﬁed equation
to calculate the midpoint hysteresis for every testing location:
Hysteresis% =j
S

 S
mn

 S

j 100% (1)
where S
start
and S
end
are the sensor readings from the
start and end points of the hysteresis loop; S
mp
and S
mn
are the readings in a positive and negative going directions,
respectively. Based on Eq. (1), the mechanical hysteresis of
the ﬁngertip sensor was statistically analyzed as shown in
Fig. 6.
In both group 1 and 2’s experiments, a cantilever effect is
formed when the external forces (P
xy
or P
z
) are applied at
the ﬁngertip (the free end) of our 3D-printed force sensor.
The readings of the three FSS sensors located at the base
(the ﬁxed end) will increase if they are on the compression
side, or decrease if they are on the tension side.
A typical loading/unloading process is shown in Fig. 5(a)
for group 1’s data. An exponential decrease of the hysteresis
with the height of the ﬁngertip was observed. This can be
resulted from the decreasing torque effect on the mechanical
hysteresis as the loading/unloading forces moving towards
the based of the ﬁngertip sensor. When the external forceP
is applied according to the group 1’s setup, in the x-y plane
of the ﬁngertip sensor, torques are simultaneously generated
at the contact sites between the central steel ball and three

FSS sensors’ contacting balls. Although the friction between
two plated metal balls is seemly small compared to the force
applied to the ﬁngertip, the induced friction could still cause
the reading of a compressed FSS sensor (see the blue curves
in Fig. 5(a)) to increase from 2.46 to 2.56 mV under the same
maximum loading force, accounting for a 33.9% of the total
increasing force from 0 to 2.27 N, as shown in Fig. 5(a) from
moving the test location from h9 to h1.
Interestingly, a similar but smaller, 9.6% increase of the
sensor reading under the maximum compression force was
observed in group 2’s data (see the red curve in Fig. 5(b))
as the z-direction forces P
z
moving from r1 to r5. This is
because the change of moment arm decreases by two times
when the same amount of testing forces are moved from
group 1 to group 2.
On the contrary, the lowest, averaged hysteresis for group
2’s data (2.19%) still appears to be over two times larger
than the lowest one from group 1’s data (0.98%)(see Fig. 6).
This is because the total span of the sensor readings (the
denominatorS
start
-S
end
in Eq. (1)) in group 2 becomes very
small (about 0.005 mV) for the sensors on the tension side
of the ﬁngertip during the six different rotations (see blue
curve in Fig. 5(b)).
Based on the above analysis, we found that the height
of the 3D-printed ﬁngertip sensor will affect the hysteresis
performance of the sensor most, therefore we redesigned an

The comparison between applied and estimated forces is
shown in Fig. 9. It is interesting to ﬁnd that our proposed
ﬁngertip sensor is able to estimate the rotation of the external
force in the x-y plane quite well, but has difﬁculties of
measuring the force (

is that the direction of the

is coincident with, but opposite
to the direction of the pre-loading force, thus the bigger the

, the more the pre-loading bolt is pushed out (in a non-
detectable way). It is out of the scope of this design paper, but
will be addressed for future version of the ﬁngertip sensor.

V. A CASE STUDY – DESIGNING FINGERTIP SENSORS FOR
PHANTOM ROBOTS’ MANIPULATION TASKS
In this section, our goal is to equip a group of 3-DOF
Phantom robots (SensAble Technologies, Inc., Wilmington,
MA) with adjustable ﬁngertip sensors so that Phantom robots

can perform manipulation tasks cooperatively. The design
requirements are listed below:
1) The ﬁngertip sensor needs to be connected to the end-
effector of a 3-DOF Phantom robot with a 1-DOF
adjustable base.
2) The ﬁngertip used for manipulation objects are expected
to be compliant, and can be easily changed to other
shapes with little effort.
3) During manipulation tasks, only the radial side of the
ﬁngertip sensor is expected to contact with the objects.
Therefore the ﬁngertip sensor should be able to detect
the directions of the external forces coming sideways.
The resolution should be within 60 degrees in the radial
plane.
4) The replacement of the ﬁngertip should be easy and fast;
the budget of each ﬁngertip should not exceed $20.
At this stage, the design requirements of the ﬁngertip
sensor are all met for the manipulation tasks of the Phantom
robots as shown in Fig. 10. More information about the
sensor can be found in our video submission. In the rest
of this section, we are going to validate the efﬁcacy of our
proposed method through experiments.
As illustrated in Fig. 11, a fully assembled ﬁngertip sensor
for the Phantom robot was tested in the experiments. A MLP-
25 load cell (Transducer techniques, CA) was attached to a
probe stylus. Infrared markers were used to track the motion
of the stylus. The 3D marker coordinates were measured
at 480 Hz using a 7-camera system (PhaseSpace Inc., San
Leandro, CA) with respect to the camera (global) frame. The
direction of the contact force applied to the ﬁngertip in the
radial plane was ﬁrst calculated in the ﬁnger frame and then
transformed to global frame for comparison.
The magnitude and the orientation of the contact force
were recorded by the the load cell and collected by the
motion capture system, respectively. Those values were used
to label and validate our experimental results. The FSR
sensor changes its resistance based on the force applied to
it. We measured the resistance using a voltage divider that
divides the 5V supply voltage between 10K
 resistor and the
sensor. We then converted the voltage reading to resistance

for reporting.
As shown in Fig. 11, the force vectors measured from the
probe stylus were ﬁrst projected onto the X-Y plane (the
radial plane) in the sensor-frame. Then the projected angles
were calculated based on their X and Y coordinates. The
projected angle is equivalent to the  value as modeled in
the section IV , and therefore its value can be calculated by
using Eq. (3) and (4).
2755
The comparison result between the measured and the
estimated projected angles is shown in Fig. 12. Note that
the readings from the load cell are only used as the contact-
event indicator. When the contact occurs, a spike would
be observed in the load cell data. The differences between
measured and estimated angles are all within 60 degrees.
This means the ﬁngertip sensor could successfully meet our
design requirements for the Phantom robot. The sources of
the discrepancies between the measured and estimated angles
most likely result from the hysteresis and non-linearity of
the FSRs [14]. In addition, the contacts between the probe
head and the silicone rubber coated ﬁngertip seemed to
be more complicated than we expected – the effect of the
deformation of the silicone rubber around the probe head
combined with the relatively large friction made it hard to
accurately measure the direction of the applied force.
VI. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
We have detailed the design of a low-cost, 3-axis ﬁngertip
sensor that is made of 3D-printed materials. Our proposed
ﬁngertip sensor is composed of a ﬁngertip, a FSS sensor
enclosed base, a cantilever-bolt, and a set of low-cost sensors.
In order to improve our design concept, experiments were
conducted on optimizing the effects of conﬁgurations on the
performance of the ﬁngertip forces. In total, over 2000 load-
ing/unloading tests were conducted for collecting data used
in statistical analysis. We found that there was no obvious
effects on the linearity of the sensor by pre-loading the FSS
sensors with the cantilever bolt. However the height of the
3D-printed ﬁngertip appears to be an important factor that
affects the hysteresis performance of the FSS sensor. Thus,
an optimized ﬁngertip sensor was used for the calibration in
the later experiments. The results of the calibration prove
that our proposed ﬁngertip sensor can detect the normal
component of the contact forces. However it was challenging
for the ﬁngertip sensor to estimate the forces acting along
the axial direction of the ﬁngertip sensor, the discrepancy
is likely from the elastic deformation of the bottom cap. In
our future work, we are planning to add this effects into the
ﬁngertip model.
At the end, a case study was presented to validate the adap-
tive feature of our design concept. Four Phantom robots were
equipped with modiﬁed ﬁngertip sensors. And each of them
costs less than $20 to fabricate. Design requirements such
as compliance, resolution, and low-cost were all achieved
through combining 3D-printing technology and innovative
design. Next we are going to perform manipulation with
those Phantom robots.
As for improving the functionality of the 3D-printed
sensor itself, we are interested in incorporating three more
sensors into the design so that the resulting sensor will
have the potential to measure all the six degrees of freedom
of a contact force. As we demonstrated in our case-study,
similar design concept can be easily adapted to different
applications with little effort. Due to its compact size, our
optimized ﬁngertip sensor will be implemented into a 20-
DOF anthropomorphic robotic hand that was previously
developed in our lab [9]. Eventually, we would like to make
our 3D model of the ﬁngertip sensor an open-source sensor
so that more researchers can beneﬁt from the convenience
and low-cost of the 3D printing technology.
