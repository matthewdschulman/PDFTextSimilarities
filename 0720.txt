I. INTRODUCTION
EfÞcient interpretation and perception of 3-D medical data
is crucial to surgeons during the clinical intervention [1].
Commonly the direct volume rendering (DVR) technique is
employed for visualization by projecting the volume data in
a projected image without the data misclassiÞcation in the
segmentation stage [2]. DVR is also used in other procedures,
such as surgical training, diagnosis and surgical planning.
In order to deÞne the meaningful visualization and em-
phasize the regions of interest in the volume data, transfer
functions (TFs) are used for mapping from voxels with
the scalar information to color and optical properties [3].
Compared with the simple TF using the scalar value only,
multi-dimensional TFs are commonly designed based on
several features, such as gradient magnitude, curvature and
statistical measures, to enable more accurate perception for
surgeons.
As shown in Fig. 1, multiple features in TF domain are
extracted, and stored in a vector every voxel. However,
as the dimensionality of TF domain increases, the direct
interaction with the transfer function becomes impractical. In
this case, we have to Þnd a low-dimensional representation of
high-dimensional features to enable the effective interaction.
One solution to this problem is dimensionality reduction

(DR) which is the transformation from the high-dimensional
data to a representation in the reduced dimension without
signiÞcant information loss [4]. Another advantage of di-
mensionality reduction is that the redundant information can
be Þltered out simultaneously.
Conventional approaches of dimensionality reduction are
primarily divided into two categories: linear and non-linear
methods. Linear dimensionality reduction is characterized by
the linear mapping, e.g. principal component analysis (PCA)
[5], and the nonlinear methods, e.g. Isomap [6] and locally
linear embedding (LLE) [7], perform better by taking into
account the nonlinearity of the original data. However, both
methods incur the problem of heavy computational load on
the large data set. For example, assume the dimension of TF
domain is 5, and a CT volume with the size of 256 256
128 is given, the input to dimensionality reduction methods
is in R
58388608
. Nevertheless, the fast implementation of
transfer function design is required in both pre- (diagnosis
and surgical planning) and intra-operation.
Recently, the rapid development in the Þled of sparse
representation (SR) paves another way to the dimensionality
reduction. This method is achieved based on the assump-
tion that the signals are compressible, and have a sparse
representation in a basis set (also a.k.a dictionary). It has
been proven practical in many applications [8]Ð[10]. In [11],
Nguyen et al. proposed a sparse embedding (SE) framework
by combing dimensionality reduction and sparse learning
together. It enables the sparse representation (sparse coding
and dictionary learning) in the reduced dimension with lower
computational load. However, current SR based methods are

still time-consuming as the mapping matrix is optimized
together with SR, especially for the medical data with the
large size.
The objective of this paper is to propose a dimensionality
reduction method with the capability to process the large
data set efÞciently for the transfer function design in the
direct volume rendering. In this paper, a novel framework
of Geometry Constrained Sparse Embedding (GCSE) is pro-
posed. To improve the efÞciency of dimensionality reduction,
the mapping matrix is separated from the framework of
SR in NguyenÕs work, and it is obtained by applying the
conventional method (i.e. PCA, Isomap and LLE) to the
dictionary under the assumption that if the features vectors
can be described well over an overcomplete dictionary, the
mapping derived from the dictionary can embed the entire
features in the target dimension. Therefore, the problem
is reduced to the optimization of dictionary. To this end,
the intrinsically geometrical structure based on a geometry
distance are taken into account. The geometry distance is
to measure the similarity and Þnd the geometry relationship
amongst data, while Euclidean distance just computes the
pairwise metric between data. Moreover, to achieve faster
implementation, the sparse representation in the proposed
method is implemented based on the stochastic gradient
descent [12].
II. GEOMETRY CONSTRAINED SPARSE EMBEDDING
As aforementioned, the transfer function design in DVR
is reduced to the dictionary learning. To obtain a better
dictionary, the intrinsically geometric structure of feature
vectors are taken into account in GCSE in this paper.
As shown in Fig. 2, for each datum in a high dimensional
data set, a group of neighbors are selected according to a
geometry distance of the datum to the hyperplane in the high
dimensional manifold, and a neighbor graph is constructed
to encode the geometrical information into GCSE. The learnt
dictionary can better describe the features with the similar
pattern, so that such dictionary can act as a surrogate for the
entire features. The framework of GCSE is summarized in
Algorithm (1). Steps 2 and 3 are to be discussed in details
in following sections.

III. NEIGHBOR SELECTION USING GEOMETRY
DISTANCE
A neighbor graph is constructed to describe the locally
geometrical relationship of the feature vectors. As a measure,
Euclidean has shown good performance in the neighbor
selection. Nevertheless, Euclidean distance is limited as only
the pairwise distance to the target data is considered. It is
desired that the local relationships in the cluster are also
taken into account. The fundamental problem in neighbor
graph construction is how to deÞne the distance in selecting
neighbors for each feature vector. In this section, a geometry
distance is computed to measure the geometrical similarity of
the features. DeÞning this geometry distance as the neighbor
criterion, we can explore the geometry relation of features.

also avoids the inverse of singular  whose eigenvalues are

measurement in Eq. (5), the neighbors of each data point are
selected incrementally until the neighbor number is satisÞed.
IV. DICTIONARY LEARNING
In this section, the dictionary is learnt by encoding the geo-
metric relation of feature vectors, and the stochastic gradient
descent method is employed to speed up the implementation
of dictionary learning.

on this basic objective function, an extra item is integrated to
preserve the geometrical structure ofX. To achieve it, we can
construct a neighbor graph G with n vertices according to
the geometry distance in Section III. Each vertex represents
a feature vector of medical data, and it is associated with
a element in the weight matrix W of G. If x

the neighbors of x

difference with the graph constructed by Euclidean distance
is that the weight matrix W is an asymmetric matrix.

In this paper, stochastic gradient descent is employed to
handle the large amount of features of medical data. The
dictionary learning algorithm is summarized in Algorithm
2. The dictionary and coefÞcients can be optimized alterna-
tively by minimizing over one while keeping the other one
Þxed [16]. To improve convergence rate further,  feature
vectors are selected randomly each iteration. Then the sparse

B. Sparse Coding
In this section, the sparse coding problem is solved by
Þxing the dictionary D. According to Algorithm 2, each
sparse coefÞcient vector 
t;i
is updated individually, while
the rest are Þxed. In order to optimize 
t;i
individually, Eq.
(9) should be formulated in a vector form. The combination
of residual item and sparse regularizer can be denoted as

In this paper, the above problem is solved using the

block-coordinate descent by minimizing residual error in

V. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
In this section, three sets of experiments were performed to
evaluate the performance of GCSE on both synthetic and real
CT data sets. The GCSE Þrstly employed the synthetic data
to compare with the existing methods, including linear and
non-linear approaches. The convergence and the robustness
of related parameters were also studied. The second exper-
iment was to test the capability of handling a large data
set using a partial CT volume extracted from the golden
standard data set [19]. For the effect of volume rendering
using different transfer functions, there is no quantitative way
to measure that. Thus, we presented the rendered images that

successfully emphasize the region of interests to compare the
difference for visualization. Human tooth CT data was used
in the last test.
The speciÞcations of data sets used in the experiments
are summarized in Table I. Toroidal Helix data set is used
directly as the input of dimensionality reduction methods.
For the real CT data sets, corresponding feature vectors
are both in 6 dimensions. The Þrst vector is related to the
intensity for each voxel. To discriminate the voxels next
to the boundaries. The following 4 ones are the gradient
information, including gradient magnitude and three com-
ponents in the gradient vector. The last one is the Hessian
measure, which can capture the edge information to deal with
complex conÞgurations. The target dimension is set to 2 for
all experiments.
A. Comparison with Conventional Methods
In this experiment, Toroidal Helix data set was used to
compared GCSE with conventional methods, including PCA,
Isomap and LLE. As shown in Fig. 3a, all conventional
methods project the input data into a symmetric and ßower-
like shape, and preserve the structure and distribution of
the helix. The number of neighbors were 40 and 60 for
Isomap and LLE, respectively, while PCA does not need
any parameters for the dimensionality reduction.
Fig. 3b shows the results of GCSE on Toroidal Helix data
set. When the learnt dictionary D was ready, we applied
PCA, Isomap and LLE toD, respectively. In this experiment,
the size of dictionary was 50, the numbers of neighbors
for Isomap and LLE were 3 and 4. We can see that much
less neighbors are required to achieve the similar effect
compared with the conventional methods. It also preserves
the geometric information of the input.
To explain the less number of neighbors in GCSE, Fig.
4 illustrates the distribution of Toroidal Helix data set and

dictionary used for dimensionality reduction. The dictionary
is better able to keep the topological structure with the less
atoms, so that the local structure can be presented using less
points in the dictionary, while more neighbors are needed to
express the same geometric information.
We also studied the convergence and robustness of GCSE
based on the stochastic gradient descent algorithm. Following
the convergence analysis of stochastic gradient descent in
[20], it is obvious that the dictionary can approximate to a
stationary point asymptotically. To verify this, we set differ-
ent sizes of dictionary and numbers of neighbors indicating
the geometric structure in the objective function. In the test,
the sizes of dictionary were f50; 100; 150; 200g, and the
values for the number of neighbors were f5; 10; 15; 20g.
GCSE is performed with the iteration number of 100, and the
batch size in each iteration is also set to 100. The residual
errors are shown in Fig. 5. In all cases, the average residual
error is 0:29.
B. Comparison with Sparse Embedding
This experiment was implemented to test the capability of
large data set handling using NguyenÕs SE and GCSE. We
tried to do the dimensionality reduction on gold standard data
set and human tooth CT. However, SE failed using both data
sets due to the memory limit. The same problem occurred
when we apply the conventional methods to these data sets.
GCSE can deal with this case, the evaluation of GCSE on
the large data set is presented in next section.
To compare the performance of GCSE and SE, a partial
CT volume extracted from gold standard data was used.
The feature vectors are in 6D, and the target dimension
is 2. In SE, the iteration number was set to 5, and a

polynomial kernel of degree was 4. For GCSE, the size of
target dictionary was set to 200, the iteration number was
100, and the size of batch processing in each iteration was
400. LLE was used to perform the dimensionality reduction
on the dictionary.
In order to facilitate the visualization of feature vectors
in the reduced dimension, the regions were assigned with
different colors according to the intensity information. Fig.
6 shows the results of SE and GCSE. Both of them can
discriminate the regions correctly. The difference is that
GCSE preserves the additional geometric information in the
original data, while SE just embedded the features into
different areas. For the computing time, GCSE takes around
3:74 s each iteration, and SE requires about 862:93 s for
every round. Although the number of iteration for SE is
less than GCSEÕs, SE is time-consuming when the total
computing time is taken into account.

C. Evaluation of Transfer Function in DVR
In this section, the rendering quality of boundaries in the
direct volume rendering is mainly evaluated using different
transfer functions on human tooth CT. Conventional methods
and SE can not handle this data set with the size of 6
1180170. One transfer function (TF-IG) is designed based
on the intensity and gradient information, the other one (TF-
GCSE) is obtained in the GCSE domain.
The rendering results are shown in Fig. 7. One of the
disadvantages for DVR using TF-IG is that some regions
close to the boundary can not be isolated exactly. As shown
in Fig. 7a, when the background/dentin boundary is labelled
with the desired color and opacity, the pulp/dentin and
background/enamel boundaries are also colored. Because
they belong to the same range deÞned by the intensity and
gradient. In Fig. 7b, TF-GCSE provides a clearer view on the
boundaries. Because the Hessian measures are involved in the
resultant features obtained by GCSE. Materials involved in
the human tooth can also be identiÞed based on TF-GCSE,
such as enamel, dentin and pulp.
VI. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, a novel scheme for dimensionality reduction
is proposed by encoding the geometrical structure based on
a geometry distance. GCSE performs well by learning a
good dictionary as a problem of SR. To the best of our
knowledge, it is the Þrst time to introduce SR into the design
of transfer function in direct volume rendering. More impor-
tantly, GCSE enhances the capability to deal with the large
data set and enables fast implementation based on stochastic
gradient descent. Experimental results show the convergence
and robustness of GCSE on the synthetic data. We also
have tested GCSE on the CT data containing millions of
samples, and the features in the reduced dimension are able
to discriminate the materials and boundaries in the volume.
