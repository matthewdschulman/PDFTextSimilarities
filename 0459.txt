Abstract— In this paper, a new type of large-dimension
reconﬁgurable suspended cable-driven parallel robots (CDPR)
is introduced as a means to substitute for conventional methods
of handing large and heavy parts across wide workspaces.
The reconﬁgurability of the proposed CDPR offers better
performances in term of workspace, ﬂexibility and power con-
sumption. A systematic procedure to solve a complex nonlinear
optimization problem to ﬁnd optimal reconﬁguration for the
robot is presented. Critical issues regarding various constraints
and performance criteria are addressed. The robot can operate
in ofﬂine reconﬁguration or online reconﬁguration modes which
offer wide range of solutions to the end-users.
I. INTRODUCTION
In the past twenty years, cable-driven parallel robots have
been extensively studied in favor of their appealing advan-
tages, compared to parallel manipulators with rigid links,
such as: light weight, large workspace, high load capacity,
ease of construction, ease of reconﬁguration and low cost.
Possible applications of CDPR in the manufacturing, con-
struction and aerospace industries are positioning and han-
dling of large and heavy parts across wide workspaces. For
example, Fig. 1 shows a conventional method to handle large
and heavy parts in a workshop by using multiple cranes to
manipulate the parts. This solution has several limits includ-
ing limited ﬂexibility and orientation capabilities. Most of
the time when the operation requires a change of orientation
of the part, there is a need of involving workers which causes
safety issues. Another example in the aerospace industry is
the airplane maintenance operations which is illustrated in

eral telescopic platforms are used to carry the workers across
the airplane fuselage. Each telescopic platform offers 4
degrees of freedom (three translations in Cartesian space and
one rotation around the vertical z-axis) which allows the task
to be done quite efﬁciently. However, this solution has some
disadvantages. First of all, each telescopic platform weights
from 9 to 11 tons which implies high costs for the building
construction to sustain such heavy systems. Furthermore, the
workers sometimes need to work in hazardous environment
where the operation requires to use chemical material like
paint or stripping products. Our motivations in this paper
comes directly from the need of looking for alternative
solutions in such situations to replace conventional methods.
By using large-dimension reconﬁgurable CDPR we could
reduce the cost of construction and improve the ﬂexibility as
well as the capacity of the systems and offer a wider range
of applications to the end-users.
Most of the past research efforts focused mainly on
conventional CDPR with winches and cable exits points
ﬁxed at given locations in the base frame. Among them,
several studies on large-dimension CDPR have been made
[1]–[14]. Notable CDPR prototypes which can handle heavy
payloads are the early NIST RoboCrane [1], the large-
dimension CDPR in FAST project [8]–[10], the Marionet
crane robot [15] and CoGiRo [16]. In [17], a solution using
cable robots to handle heavy parts in airplane maintenance
has been implemented. The introduced AMP cable robot
uses NISTs RoboCrane technology in which six hoist cables
from three upper support points tautly support, stabilize, and
maneuver the work platform. To our best knowledge, there
is no published technical paper about the AMP.

Recent studies [15], [18]–[20] deal with reconﬁgurable
CDPR where the geometry structure of the CDPR can be
reconﬁgured by changing its cable layout. Such reconﬁg-
urability could greatly increase the CDPR capability. Mean-
while, it adds redundancy and increases the complexity of
the system. For the design of such CDPR, in [18], Rosati
introduced the concept of adaptive cable-driven systems. He
discussed a systematic procedure to determine the design
solution for planar cable-driven systems which minimizes
or maximizes some local performance indices such as cable
tension based criteria and dexterity of the CDPR. Later on,
Xiaobo Zhou in [19] presented an analysis framework for
cooperating cable mobile robots. The proposed method to
solve the reconﬁguration of such systems is similar to that
of Rosati in the sense that the solutions were derived from
optimizing certain criteria. In [20], Zhou et al. proposed
a generalized modeling framework for systematic design
and analysis of cooperative mobile cable robots. They deal
with the redundancy resolution by optimally repositioning
the mobile bases to maximize the so-called tension factor
which is the ratio between minimal and maximal values of
cable tensions along a given trajectory. However, all these
previous studies only consider planar robot systems where
important constraints such as cable interferences are not
taken into account. Moreover, critical issues while using
standard optimization tools to solve the redundancy of the
robot system such as:
 the continuity of the performance indices with respect
to the deciding parameters
 the continuity and differentiability of the constraints
have not been addressed. In fact, the continuity of the
tension based performance indices can be dealt with by using
tension distribution method such as the one in [21]. However,
it is difﬁcult to address the second issue since there are
different types of constraints including wrench feasibility
(continuous nonlinear constraints) and cable interferences
(non-differentiable constraints). Furthermore, the problem
becomes more complex for a highly redundant CDPR. Be-
cause of these issues, the implementation of the existing
methods in solving the reconﬁguration of a 6-DOF CDPR
is an issue, especially under real-time constraints.
The contributions of the present paper are mainly focused
on the use of gradient-based optimization tools to solve the
CDPR reconﬁguration. First, we introduce a particular type
of large-dimension reconﬁgurable suspended CDPR which
offers alternative solutions to the conventional methods of
handling large and heavy parts across wide workspaces.
Then, a systematic procedure to solve the reconﬁguration
of such systems is proposed. The CDPR reconﬁguration
is divided into two sub-optimization problems. The ﬁrst
problem consists of ﬁnding the bounds on the reconﬁguration
parameters in which all the nonlinear constraints including
wrench feasibility and geometric constraints are satisﬁed.
The CDPR reconﬁguration is thereby transformed into a
classical box-constrained problem which can be solved with
standard optimization tools. Two reconﬁguration strategies
are considered: ofﬂine reconﬁguration and online reconﬁg-
uration. Two criteria are introduced to quantify the robot
performance in term of power consumption: the sum of cable
tensions (used in ofﬂine reconﬁguration) and minimal energy
consumption of the CDPR (used in online reconﬁguration).
The procedure provides a straightforward approach which is
familiar to engineers and could be implemented in real-time
software environments.
The paper is organized as follows. Section II presents
the general architecture of the new type of reconﬁgurable
CDPR considered in this paper. Section III recalls the usual
modeling of CDPR. The procedure to solve the reconﬁg-
uration is discussed in Section IV . Simulation examples
are presented in Section V . Finally, some remarks on our
proposed methodology are made in Section VI.
II. LARGE-DIMENSION RECONFIGURABLE
CDPR ARCHITECTURE
Fig. 3 shows the general concept of large-dimension
reconﬁgurable suspended CDPR considered in this paper to
replace conventional cranes or telescopic platforms as those
shown in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2. The winches that drive the cables
are attached onto two overhead bridge cranes to form a large-
dimension CDPR. The positions of the winches or cable exit
points can be changed by mobile bases that ride on each
crane. The overhead bridge cranes can move along the side
walls of the workshop building. In this way, each CDPR
should cover any area in the workshop. Depending on the
size of the workshop, multiple CDPR can be used to perform
different tasks across wide workspaces.
In fact, this idea is derived originally from the experiences
of partners involved in the CableBOT
2
consortium. Firstly,
the general suspended architecture of the reconﬁgurable
CDPR is similar to that of the ﬁxed-conﬁguration redundant
suspended CDPR CoGiRo prototype [16] since CoGiRo’s
geometry structure has shown some great potential. Sec-
ondly, the moving cranes are adapted from the overhead
bridge crane systems that carry heavy parts in workshops.

By attaching the winches on the cranes, there will be mostly
vertical forces acting on the two side walls of the building.
Lateral force components created by cables tensions which
are orthogonal to the side walls are minimized. However,
horizontal force components in the cables that tend to bring
the two overhead bridge cranes together may need to be
avoided. One solution is to connect the two cranes with
some support beams to sustain these horizontal forces. In
this manner, the robot system loses one degree of redundancy
but, in return, becomes more stable.
In the general scenario, the 6-DOF mobile platform of the
CDPR is driven by 8 cables and two overhead bridge cranes.
Each cable exit point is driven by an actuator. If all the cable
exit points could move freely along the bridge cranes, the
number of total actuators would be 18 (here, 10 actuators are
used to reconﬁgure the robot geometry structure). It results
in a highly redundant robot system. We propose to move the
cable exit points by pairs along the bridges to reduce the total
number of actuator from 18 to 14. If we ﬁx the cable exit
points and also the positions of two overhead bridge cranes,
the total number of actuators that drive the mobile platform
is reduced to 8. In this latter case, the CDPR becomes
one similar to the ﬁxed-conﬁguration redundant CDPR (e.g.
CoGiRo prototype).
In the most complex case considered in this paper, the
reconﬁgurability of the proposed CDPR is determined by
a maximum of 6 actuators that drive the 4 pairs of cable
exit points (r
1
;:::;r
4
) and the 2 overhead bridge cranes
(r
5
;r
6
), as shown in Fig. 3. Hence, (r
1
;r
2
;:::;r
6
) are the
reconﬁguration parameters. Note that the positions of the two
overhead bridge cranes can be ﬁxed in order for the CDPR
to perform at speciﬁc areas in the workshop. In such cases,
there are only four reconﬁguration parameters r
1
;r
2
;r
3
and
r
4
.
It is worth noting that, by keeping the general suspended
redundant structure similar to the CoGiRo prototype [21]
(using 8 cables to drive the mobile platform), the Cartesian
workspace and orientation workspace of the CDPR are
increased substantially, compared to 6-cable CDPR such as
the AMP [17]. Furthermore, reconﬁgurability should improve
the CDPR performances and offers more ﬂexible choices to
the end-users (in the present paper, reconﬁgurability means
the ability to change the locations of the cable exit points of
the CDPR).
The CDPR can operate in two modes, ofﬂine reconﬁgu-
ration and online reconﬁguration. In ofﬂine reconﬁguration,
appropriate positions of the cable exit points are determined
ofﬂine. Thereby, the geometric structure of the CDPR is
adapted to the tasks at hand. After the reconﬁguration of
cable exit points has been performed, the cable exit point
positions are ﬁxed and the robot starts the given tasks.
Meanwhile, online reconﬁguration consists in changing the
positions of the cable exit points along a trajectory followed
by the CDPR mobile platform.
III. MODELING
Fig. 4 shows the general structure of a CDPR which
includes the cable and winches driving the mobile platform,
the cable exit pointsA
i
, the cable anchor pointsB
i
and the
mobile platform. By controlling the length of each cable, a
CDPR can directly position its end-effector.
A. Solving the cable tension distribution of a CDPR
For large-dimension CDPR handling heavy payloads
(could be over 1 ton), hefty steel cables are used because
of high safety factors. The sagging of cables may affect
the robot performances [11]–[13]. Cable models with non-
negligible mass and elasticity must be taken into account. By
using the simpliﬁed cable model derived in [13], [14], one
can solve the tension distribution problem of a CDPR with
hefty steel cables using efﬁcient methods such as the one in
[21]. The cable tensions satisfy the equilibrium equations of

IV. CDPR RECONFIGURATION SOLUTION
A. Reconﬁgurability general concept
In our view, the reconﬁgurability of a cable-driven parallel
robot is the capability of changing its cable layout to increase
the robot ﬂexibility and obtain better performances under
certain constraints. It can be formulated as the following
nonlinear constrained optimization problem:
”Finding a set of reconﬁguration parametersr which mini-
mizes several performance criteriaf(r) = (f

r2C
r
where r
l
and r
u
are the lower and upper bounds on the
reconﬁguration parameters r. Each criterion f
i
is computed
with respects to one or several platform poses. C
r
is the
set of reconﬁguration parameters that satisfy all nonlinear
constraints including geometric constraints and wrench fea-
sibility constraints.”
In this general problem, there are two types of constraints.
The ﬁrst ones are geometric constraints which are the limi-
tations on Cartesian workspace and orientation workspace of
the CDPR. Satisfying these constraints means that the CDPR
pose at hand is collision free. The second type are tension
based constraints which involve the dynamic modeling of the
mobile platform to compute the cable tensions of the CDPR.
In this paper, the considered objective functions to be
optimized are cable tensions based performance indices. To
ensure the conditions of continuity and differentiability of
these criteria, the method in [21] is used to solve the tension
distribution of the CDPR.
In order to reduce the complexity of this general optimiza-
tion problem, we divide it into sub-optimization problems
and solve them separately using readily available optimiza-
tion tools.
B. Desired CDPR performances
In practice, for a certain task, expected working space
of a CDPR with desired performances should be deﬁned
beforehand as a set of:
 positions in Cartesian space
 orientations
 velocities
 accelerations
 wrenches
which veriﬁes the collision-free and wrench feasible condi-
tions.
The nonlinear constraints corresponding to r2 C
r
are
deﬁned by these desired performances.
C. Sub-optimization problems
1) Determining the bounds on the reconﬁguration param-
eters: The goal of this step is to ﬁnd lower bounds and
upper bounds of the reconﬁguration parameters by solving
the following optimization problems:
r
min
= minfrg ; r
max
= maxfrg (8)
subject to:
r2C
r
This step is important since it eliminates the geometric
constraints and tension based constraints, thus enabling the
use of standard gradient-based optimization tools to solve
the general problem (7) more effectively.
The method to solve this problem will be discussed later
in more detail in Section VI.
2) Box-constrained optimization problem: Let us assume
that the bounds on the reconﬁguration parameters are found.
Thereby, the general optimization problem (7) is transformed
into a box-constrained optimization problem which is much
simpler to solve:

D. Reconﬁguration strategy
1) Ofﬂine reconﬁguration: The aim of ofﬂine reconﬁgu-
ration is to ﬁnd a set of reconﬁguration parameters (locally)
optimal with respect to a performance index over the as-
signed workspace and for given required performances. Let
us take an example. Assume that one want the CDPR to reach
any pose in a given workspace at any acceleration in a given
5731
range, while keeping the cable tensions within prescribed
limits. Ofﬂine reconﬁguration can consist in ﬁnding “the
best” locations for the cable exit points allowing the CDPR
to do so with minimal power consumption.
To optimize the performance index with respect to the
whole workspace, we discretize the latter into a ﬁnite set of
N equilibrium poses. This procedure is time consuming if
there are a lot of discretized points in the ﬁnite set to be eval-
uated. In fact, it is generally satisfactory enough to evaluate
the objective function at poses that lie on the boundary of
the assigned workspace. Then, the global criterion method
[22] is used to ﬁnd the optimal reconﬁguration according to
the following steps.
 Step 1: Find the optimal conﬁguration r

where B

Ofﬂine reconﬁguration is in fact a multi-objective opti-
mization problem. A speciﬁcity of the problem at hand is
that in usual multi-objective optimization there are more
than one objective function to be evaluated at a speciﬁc
pose whereas, in ofﬂine reconﬁguration, there is only one
objective function to be evaluated at many different poses.
Furthermore, the priority of evaluating the objective function
at every pose in ofﬂine reconﬁguration can be treated equally
which eliminates the difﬁculty of choosing suitable priority
factors for each objective function as in the usual case of
multi-objective optimization.
2) Online reconﬁguration: In online reconﬁguration, we
aim to ﬁnd “the best” CDPR reconﬁgurations along a given
trajectory. The locations of the cable exit points are updated
at each sample time in such a way that minimizes a certain
performance index.
Because of the real-time constraint, the online reconﬁgu-
ration should be treated as a single-objective optimization
problem. At each sample time, we aim at solving the
optimization problem within a few iterations. The number
of iterations will be limited by the total time consumption
(normally, we could only allow 1, 2 or 3 iterations).
In online reconﬁguration, the box constrained optimization
problem (9) is deﬁned as follows: At thes th sample time,

is the maximum step size of the reconﬁguration param-
eters allowed at each sample time.
One can initialize the starting point as the optimal solu-
tion found from ofﬂine reconﬁguration with respect to the
same performance index since it reduces the probability of
converging to a poor local minimum.
In online reconﬁguration mode, two issues must be ad-
dressed carefully. Firstly, at each sample time, the new
reconﬁguration parameters r
(s)
opt
must not exceed a certain
value because of the limitations of the actuators that drive
the cable exit points and the cable lengths:
jr
(s)
iopt
 r
(s 1)

r
; i = 1;p (16)
Secondly, the movement of the cable exit points and the
changes of the cable lengths are coupled together. Because of
these issues, the constraint (14) is added in order to maintain
the synchronization in driving the cable exit points A
i
and
the cable lengths in the control system.
E. Cable tension based performance indices
Let us consider a CDPR driven by m cables in a conﬁg-
uration deﬁned by r. At an equilibrium pose of the mobile
platform, by solving the tension distribution problem, we
achieve desired cable tensions 
i
; i = 1;2;:::;m.
1) Sum of the cable tensions: In ofﬂine reconﬁguration,
we choose the sum of the cable tensions as the objective
function:
f(r) =
m
X
i=1

i
(r) (17)
This index relates directly to the power consumption of the
CDPR. In case of the proposed suspended CDPR architecture
(Fig. 3), minimizing this performance index gives us the
optimal solution which coincides with the upper bounds on
the reconﬁguration parameters (an illustrating example is
given in Section V). The solution are found using Matlab
optimization toolbox or NLopt package [23].
2) Energy consumption: In online reconﬁguration, we
compute the minimal power consumption that is needed to
move the mobile platform along a given trajectory, neglecting
friction between cables and pulleys or drums and between
the mobile bases and the overhead bridge cranes (thus, also
neglecting the energy needed to move the cable exit points):

V. ILLUSTRATION EXAMPLES
Let us consider a situation where several CDPR are
working in a workshop. Each CDPR has to position a heavy
platform in several areas which are shown in Fig. 5. In this
situation, at each working cell, the positions of the two cranes
are ﬁxed. Support beams are used to sustain the horizontal
forces created by the cable tensions that tend to bring the
two cranes together. The distance between the two cranes
is constant and calculated with respect to the size of the
working cell. It means that the number of active actuators
which reconﬁgure the positions of the cable exit points is 4
(the 8 cable exit points are moved by pairs). After ﬁnishing
the workload in an area, the CDPR moves to the next area.
Assume that the CDPR is operating in a given working
cell. The size of the CDPR is22m14m6:4m (lwh).
The distance between the two cable exit points within a pair
mounted on an overhead bridge crane is 2m. The mobile
platform is a cube of size length 2m and weighting 2000kg.
Its center of mass C coincides with the origin of the local
frame O

(which means d =

B. Online reconﬁguration
Currently, we consider online reconﬁguration as an op-
tional operation mode since the reliability of the method to
solve this problem need to be veriﬁed in further studies. In
this case, we only present the results assuming that the robot
system performs under ideal conditions (e.g. without loss
due to friction, perfect synchronization in the control system
while updating online the cable lengths and the cable exit
point positions). The starting point for online reconﬁguration
isr

given in (20). The objective is to minimize the energy
consumption along a trajectory. The maximum step size of
the reconﬁguration parameters allowed at each iteration is

The energy saving rate between ofﬂine conﬁguration at r
opt
and r
min
is 15:23%. When switching to online reconﬁgura-
tion, the energy saving rate in this case is 1:7187%. These
results show that ofﬂine reconﬁguration provides a good
solution in term of minimizing energy consumption. Under
the ideal conditions considered in this paper (no friction,
etc.), online reconﬁguration mode also reduces the total
energy consumption of the CDPR but only slightly compared
to ofﬂine mode. Note that the optimization tool LBFGS [25]
in the nonlinear optimization package [23] was used to solve
the boxed constrained optimization problems (9) - (10) in
ofﬂine and online reconﬁguration modes since this method
is fast and provides stable results.
VI. REMARK ON THE METHODOLOGY
In our study, we developed a heuristic method to speed up
the computation of the upper bounds on the reconﬁguration
parameters in problem (8) which takes advantage of the
particular characteristics of the reconﬁgurable CDPR family
considered in the paper. We may clarify this point as follows.
Fig. 8: Results in online reconﬁguration
First of all, let us emphasize two points:
 The cable exit points that reconﬁgure the CDPR struc-
ture are constrained to move along the overhead bridge
cranes, i.e., along only one direction
 The considered CDPR are suspended (all cable exit
points are located above the mobile platform)
Hence, by minimizing the sum of the cable tensions, the
cable exit points will tend to move to the positions where the
cables are as vertical as possible while balancing the mobile
platform weight. This behavior results in the fact that the
optimal solution found in ofﬂine reconﬁguration coincides
with the upper bounds on the reconﬁguration parameters as
shown in Fig. 6.
Knowing that fact beforehand, we solve the problem (8)
as follows. The priority of this step becomes ﬁnding the
solution that gives the best results in minimizing the sum of
cable tensions, which also means ﬁnding the maximum value
of the upper bound vector r
max
. Fig. 9a shows the optimal
solution. Whereas, Fig. 9b shows a solution for the upper
bound vector where we try to increase the value of r
2max
which results in reducing the values of r
3max
substantially.
It is due to the fact that, in order to satisfy the conditions
of wrench feasibility and the geometric constraints, the span

of cable exit points (the polygon C

the assigned workspace (the rectangle box). The changes in
r
2max
and r

shown in Fig. 9b result in increasing the
value of the sum of cable tensions. Therefore, updating the
values of the pairs of reconﬁguration parameters (r

) and
(r
2
;r
3
) along the directions that keep the line C

and

orthogonal to the overhead bridge cranes should lead
us to the optimal solution. This heuristic helps a lot to reduce
the computation time needed to solve the sub-optimization
problem (8).
In fact, in the examples shown in Section V, while solving
problem (8), we set the maximum displacement of updating
the reconﬁguration values in each iteration to dr = 0:1m.
The time needed to ﬁnd only the upper bound vector r
max
is around 2min (which is quite fast). However, the total
time needed to ﬁnd the lower bound vector r
min
(including
checking all the constraints at all discretized poses) is around
40 50min. In online reconﬁguration, the time estimated
for each iteration is around 30 40ms. We use MATLAB
on a PC with core i7 2:7GHz to run the simulations.
CONCLUSIONS
We have presented in this paper a solution using large-
dimension reconﬁgurable suspended CDPR to replace con-
ventional methods of handling heavy payloads across a wide
workspace. The introduced reconﬁgurable CDPR family can
be adapted in various environments and is expected to have
great potential.
Critical issues in solving the reconﬁguration of this CDPR
have been discussed. By transforming the general complex
problem into more simple sub-optimization problems, we
can take advantage of readily available tools to derive an
optimal solution. In situations where there is no reliable
method to handle difﬁcult issues in online reconﬁguration,
ofﬂine reconﬁguration offers a more reliable choice to the
end-users. Furthermore, the presented method to determine
ofﬂine reconﬁgurations can be applied to speciﬁc cases such
as ﬁnding the optimal solution for a given trajectory.
It is also worth noting that, besides the two presented per-
formance indices, there are important criteria that determine
the quality of a CDPR such as the stiffness at the mobile
platform. They can be implemented within the framework
of the procedure proposed in this paper is part of our future
work.
