a Novel Tool for the Investigation of Gait

Abstract— Locomotion is one of the human’s most important
functions that serve survival, progress and interaction. Gait
requires kinematic and dynamic coordination of the limbs and
muscles, multi-sensory fusion and robust control mechanisms.
The force stimulus generated by the interaction of the foot
with the walking surface is a vital part of the human gait.
Although there have been many studies trying to decipher
the load feedback mechanisms of gait, there is a need for the
development of a versatile system that can advance research and
provide new functionality. In this paper, we present the design
and characterization of a novel system, called Variable Stiffness
Treadmill (VST). The device is capable of controlling load
feedback stimulus by regulating the walking surface stiffness in
real time. The high range of available stiffness, the resolution
and accuracy of the device, as well as the ability to regulate
stiffness within the stance phase of walking, are some of the
unique characteristics of the VST. We present experiments with
healthy subjects in order to prove the concept of our device
and preliminary ﬁndings on the effect of altered stiffness on
gait kinematics. The developed system constitutes a uniquely
useful research tool, which can improve our understanding of
gait and create new avenues of research on gait analysis and
rehabilitation.
I. INTRODUCTION
Stimulus is a vital part of the human gait mechanisms.
It is the feedback that governs the way we operate in our
complex and evolving environment. In human gait motion,
there are many forms of stimulus; however, each type of
stimulus holds essential information, without which, proper
gait motion would be an impossible task. While the effect of
load feedback (an important stimulus) on gait has been an
active ﬁeld of study (for example [1]–[9]), there is a need
for the development of a versatile system that can advance
research in this area by providing new functionality.
In previous studies, researchers have utilized compliant
surfaces to investigate the effect of load feedback on gait.
The simplest setups include surfaces created out of foam
of varying stiffness [10], [11], or collegiate gym mats [12].
However, inherent in these setups is the inability to utilize
a large range of stiffness while maintaining high resolution
(without employing an extreme number of materials).
The development of devices that allow for easy adjustment
of stiffness between experiments began decades ago by
McMahon and Greene [13]. Their setup included simply
supported plywood boards where the stiffness is changed
by adjusting the distance between the two supports [13].
More recently, Kerdok et al. also utilized the concept of

the deformation of a supported compliant beam in their
development of a compliant track treadmill [14]. While
improving the easiness and resolution of compliant walking
surfaces, these designs do not allow for the compliance of the
surface to be changed in situ. Moreover, there is no ability
to exert a prescribed force perturbation to the foot in real
time while a subject is actively walking on the surface.
In order to address the gaps left by other devices, a novel
system, called Variable Stiffness Treadmill (VST), has been
developed with several advantages over existing devices.
First of all, the VST has a wide range of controllable stiffness
(essentially zero to inﬁnite), but maintains high resolution.
Second, it has the ability to actively vary and control the
compliance of the treadmill surface within the gait cycle.
Unlike previous devices, the VST is capable of creating
any proﬁle of stiffness during an experiment and throughout
the gait cycle. Third, by measuring the displacement of the
walking surface, we can not only estimate the load force
exerted on the foot, but can also exert a force on the foot
by adjusting the stiffness in real-time. The above elements
allow for a better understanding of gait. The novel setup
we developed allows for a large range of selectable stiffness
throughout the gait cycle, as well as for full-continuous
control of that stiffness during the stance phase. This allows
the introduction of a plethora of force perturbations to the
leg that are impossible to implement with current devices.
In this paper, we introduce the VST system by presenting
its design characteristics, its governing equations, and results
of initial experiments. We ﬁrst present the concept of variable
stiffness and the mechanism used to control it. We analyze its
governing equations of motion and functionality. Then, we
analyze all the subsystems of the total device that allow the
real-time operation. Experiments with human subjects were
designed in order to prove the concept of our device. We
present experimental data that shows the efﬁciency of the
system and preliminary data on the effect of altered stiffness
on gait kinematics. The proposed system constitutes the ﬁrst
mechanical device that can alter the walking surface stiffness
in real-time, with accuracy, resolution and robustness. The
latter characteristics provide a uniquely useful research tool,
which can improve our understanding of gait and create new
avenues of research on gait analysis and rehabilitation.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section II
details the structure and governing equations of the device,
as well as its technical speciﬁcations. Section III presents
proof-of-concept experiments using the VST on healthy
subjects. Finally, section IV concludes the paper with a brief
discussion and summary of the contribution.

II. METHODS
A. Design Characteristics
The VST achieves greater versatility and functionality
than other devices by combining a variety of components
into one unique system. The device is shown in Fig 1.
The major components of the VST include a variable stiff-
ness mechanism, a linear track (Thomson Linear Inc), a
force sensor mat, a split belt treadmill, a DC treadmill
motor (Anaheim Automation), a counter-weight system, and
a custom-built body weight support (LiteGait) with two
loadcells measuring the subject’s weight supported by the
system. Each component is important to the system for the
overall function and proper investigation of gait, and will be
analyzed below.
B. Variable Stiffness Mechanism
The main novel feature of the VST is the ability to vary
the vertical stiffness of the walking surface (i.e. treadmill),
therefore controlling the force interaction between the walker
and the walking surface. The capability of the VST to achieve
a large range of controllable stiffness with high resolution
comes from a novel variable stiffness mechanism. In its most
simpliﬁed form, the variable stiffness mechanism is a spring-
loaded lever mounted on a translational track, as shown
in Fig. 2. The effective stiffness of the treadmill, located
at a distance x from the pivot joint, is dependent on the
Fig. 2. The variable stiffness mechanism. Conceptual diagram (top) and
actual setup (bottom).
coefﬁcient of stiffnessS of the linear spring and the moment
armr through which it exerts a force [15]. By design,S and
r remain constant, therefore, the effective stiffness of the
treadmill can be controlled by changing the distance x.
In order to get our desired range of stiffness, we built
the variable stiffness mechanism (Fig. 2) with two extension
springs of stiffnessk = 5122N=m, rest length of12:7cm and
outside diameter of2:54cm (LE 135J 06 M, Lee Spring Co.).
The two springs are combined in parallel, at a distance of
7:5cm from the pivot point. The spring stiffness was chosen
to meet our speciﬁcation for the range of effective treadmill
stiffness, which is analyzed below.
This entire assembly sits on the carriage of a high-capacity
linear track (Thomson Linear, Part Number: 2RE16-150537)
which is controlled by a high-precision drive (Kollmorgen,
Part Number: AKD-P00606-NAEC-0000) and has a transla-
tional resolution of0:01mm. This results in a high resolution
for the adjustment of effective stiffness that is discussed
below.
In addition to achieving the desired range and resolution
of stiffness with the variable stiffness mechanism, we can
also vary the treadmill stiffness actively throughout the gait
cycle. In the most extreme scenario of going from a rigid
surface, i.e. treadmill stiffness of K
t
=1, to the minimum
achievable stiffness, the linear track will have to move across
its entire range (0 to 40cm). Considering the fact that the
linear track can move as fast as 3m=s, the system could
make this extreme change in stiffness in 0:13s. Assuming
that the subject is walking at a normal pace of 1:4m=s [16],
[17], with a stride length (the distance between consecutive
points of initial contact by the same foot) of 1:4m [18], the
stance phase would last approx. 0:5s. This means that the
variable stiffness mechanism can make this extreme change
in stiffness three times during the stance phase. Therefore, it
can easily change stiffness many times throughout the gait

cycle when the desired change in stiffness is smaller than
the two extremes. The ability to change stiffness at a high
rate throughout the stance phase of the gait cycle adds to the
unique capabilities of the VST.
C. Governing Equations
1) Kinematics: A kinematic analysis of the VST was
performed in order to create a mathematical model relating
the measured inputs: angular deﬂection of the treadmill (

), to the
effective treadmill stiffness at the location of the foot. To
accomplish this, the vector loop shown in Fig. 3 was created
based off of the rigid body structure of the VST. The vector

position of the subject’s foot and the angular deﬂection of the
treadmill, the control variable of the system is the position
of the track x
track
.
The range of the control of the track position will deﬁne
the range of the treadmill effective stiffness that we can
achieve. Forx
track
= 0, the treadmill stiffness is practically
inﬁnite, since the treadmill can not be deﬂected. For the
maximum displacement of the track of 40cm, the computed
treadmill stiffness, assuming that the foot of the subject is
approximately in the middle of the treadmill (i.e. during mid-
stance), is585:5N=m. At the end of the treadmill (i.e. at toe-
off phase), the minimum achievable stiffness is 61:7N=m.
The resolution of achievable displacement of the linear
track is 0:01mm. Since the relationship between the lin-
ear track position and the treadmill effective stiffness in
non-linear, the resolution of achievable treadmill stiffness
is dependent on the linear track position. By solving the
aforementioned equations and using the given linear track
resolution, we can compute the resolution for stiffness for
any given linear track position. This solution curve is de-
picted in Fig. 6, where it is shown that the resolution of
stiffness can range from9:06N=m when the linear track is at
5cm, to 0:038N=m when the linear track is at its maximum
displacement of 40cm. Lower resolution is achieved for
position between 0 and 5cm of the linear track, as stiffness
grows to inﬁnity.
D. Experimental Validation
The results obtained from the mathematical model were
compared to experimental data for validation. The apparent
2841
stiffness of the treadmill for 1cm interval displacements
of the linear track was found by placing a known mass
(4:5kg) at a known distance (0:33m) along the treadmill and
measuring the angular displacement of the treadmill. This
process resulted in a plot of stiffness vs. the track position.
The resulting curve was compared to the theoretical model
where the foot position x
f
was deﬁned as 0:33m to match
the experimental setup. The results are shown in Fig. 7. It
can be observed that both models achieve the same type of
inverse square power proﬁle and converge at low stiffnesses.
The slightly higher stiffness values from the experimental
data in parts of the domain may reﬂect the fact that friction
is not accounted for in the theoretical model. Friction would
cause a decrease in deﬂection for a given force resulting in
higher stiffness values than a frictionless model. However,
our theoretical model matched the experimental one very
well, proving the validity of our system. This plot also gives
an indication of the range of achievable stiffness as a function
of the linear track position.
E. Additional Components
1) Force sensor mat: In order to track the location of
the subject’s foot, an array of eight force sensing resistors
was placed beneath the treadmill belt. Whichever sensor
is underneath the center of pressure of the foot will give
the highest force reading. When two sensors give similar
high force measurements, we can assume that the center of
pressure is between the two sensors. Given that the sensor
mat spans 80cm, with our eight sensors, we have a spatial
resolution of 5cm. Assuming that the average human foot
length is about 23:5cm [19], this resolution is sufﬁcient
to know the location of the foot. As was shown in the
mathematical derivation above, the foot position is used as an
input to calculate the corresponding linear track position that
will create the proper apparent stiffness beneath the subject.
The force sensor mat is shown in Fig. 1, part C.
2) Split-belt treadmill: The VST employs a split-belt
treadmill conﬁguration in order to allow each belt to deﬂect
different amounts. This will allow different force pertur-
bations to be applied to each leg. The treadmill belts are
supported 70cm above the ﬂoor on a frame of steel tubing
that permits each belt to independently deﬂect downward
to a maximum of 30

from the horizontal position. The
adjustability of the treadmill stiffness is currently limited to
only one belt, but can be applied to both sides by installing
another variable stiffness mechanism. The split belt treadmill
is shown in Fig. 1, part D.
3) Treadmill motor: A 1-HP variable speed DC motor
(Anaheim Automation, Part Number: BDA-56C-100-90V-
1800) drives the treadmill belts. We can obtain speeds of
up to 1:85m=s at a resolution of 7mm=s. This includes the
average preferred walking speed of 1:2 1:4m=s [16], [17],
but can be slowed for individuals in therapy or rehabilitation
applications. The treadmill motor is shown in Fig. 1, part E.
4) Counterweight: One necessary component to ensure
accurate control of treadmill stiffness is a counterweight
system to eliminate moments from the treadmill’s weight.
This is achieved by fastening a weighted slider at the precise
location along a co-linear beam (attached to the side of the
treadmill platform) which will induce an equal and opposite
moment to that of the treadmill at any inclination of the
treadmill. The counterweight is shown in Fig. 1, part F.
5) Body weight support: Separate from the treadmill
structure, there is a custom-built body weight support de-
signed by LiteGait. By adjusting the height of the support
system, we can choose to have full or partial body-weight
support. This is an important capability to reduce ground
reaction forces to allow more accurate control of force
perturbations. In addition, the support increases safety and
extends the system’s capabilities to stroke patients and other
individuals with decreased mobility and stability. Two load-
cells attached on the body-weight support harness measure
the subject’s weight supported by the mechanism from each
side. The body weight support and the loadcells are shown
in Fig. 1, parts G and H respectively.
III. RESULTS
In order to test the device with healthy subjects and to
validate its performance, we conducted some experimental
studies, as “proof of concept” for the device. For our prelimi-
nary experiments, two healthy males walked on the treadmill
moving at a comfortably slow speed of 0:45m=s with three
different treadmill stiffnesses: 100, 60, and 20 kN/m. This
range resembles that of other variable stiffness devices [13],
[14], [20]–[22]. The stiffness was kept constant throughout
the gait cycle. The provided body weight supported was
controlled at approx. 40%. The kinematic data was obtained
using a motion capture system (3D Investigator, Northern
Digital) that was used to track ﬁve markers located at the
torso, hip, knee, ankle, and toe in order to calculate the joint
angles throughout the gait cycle.
The averaged kinematic data across both subjects is shown
in Fig. 8. The hip ﬂexion-extension, knee ﬂexion-extension
and ankle dorsi/plantar ﬂexion are shown (mean and standard
deviation across all gait cycles). The data is plotted as a
function of the gait cycle percentage, where 0% corresponds
to heel-strike, 60% corresponds to toe-off etc. As can be seen,
the joint angle proﬁles resemble that of normal gait [18],
therefore our system did not alter the normal gait kinematics.
The knee and hip kinematics appear to be unaffected by the
effective treadmill stiffness changes, while the ankle joint
appears to have some systematic increased plantar ﬂexion
before toe-off, as the effective treadmill stiffness is lowered.
This is expected since the loading of the foot between heel-
off and toe-off will press the treadmill downwards at lower
stiffness, and therefore the ankle will need to plantar-ﬂex
more. Additional studies will be conducted in order to further
investigate the effects of stiffness on gait kinematics.
IV. CONCLUSIONS
This paper presented the VST device that has been devel-
oped with several advantages over existing devices for gait
research. The VST can alter the walking surface stiffness
in real time, offering a wide range of available stiffness,

practically from inﬁnite stiffness (non-compliant walking
surface) to as low as 61:7N=m. The resolution of the
controlled stiffness can research a maximum of 0:038N=m,
while the effective stiffness can change from maximum to
minimum in 0:13s. All those characteristics make the VST
a unique research platform. Unlike previous devices, the
VST is capable of creating any proﬁle of stiffness during
an experiment and throughout the gait cycle.
Apart from a unique research tool, the VST can be applied
for gait rehabilitation. The ability to apply perturbations
and regulate force feedback allows for the deﬁnition of
rehabilitation protocols beyond the state of the art, where the
interplay of the leg dynamics with a dynamic environment
will play a major role. Moreover, the VST can be used as a
simulation-testing device for biological and artiﬁcial walkers,
when investigating walking patterns and architectures in
environments of variable stiffness is required.
