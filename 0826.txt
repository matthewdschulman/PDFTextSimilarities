Abstract—This paper presents a Mechanically Adjustable
Stiffness Actuator(MASA) for knee rehabilitation of stroke
patients. The MASA is designed for safer and more effective
physical human-robot interaction with patients in rehabilita-
tion. The MASA consists of cantilever springs, a double-tripod
parallel mechanism, and a torque limiter. Using the double-
tripod parallel mechanism and two identical actuators, the
effectivelengthandtherestingpositionofthecantileversprings
are controlled independently. Changes of the effective length of
the cantilever springs result in variation of the stiffness of the
MASA.Oneendofeachcantileverspringsisattachedtoanaxis
viathetorquelimiter.Whenanexternaltorquebeyondthepre-
set threshold is applied from and to the axis, the torque limiter
is released so the axis rotates freely regardless of the position
of the actuators. The MASA is used for a knee rehabilitation
robot. Due to the springs and the torque limiter, physical safety
of the patients is guaranteed in case of unexpected involuntary
muscle activities (i.e. spasticity) during a therapy session. With
changing stiffness of the MASA, the amount of assistance by
the robot is possible to be adjusted.
I. INTRODUCTION
For better rehabilitation of stroke patients, repetitive mus-
cle exercises with high intensity are required. During a
typical therapy session, intensity of the exercises is limited
due to lack of availability of therapists. It is a appropriate
application of robots since robots are suitable for repetitive
and intensive work. However, physical safety is one of
the problems caused by use of robots, which needs to be
addressed before introducing the robots into the therapy
session. In this paper, a mechanically adjustable stiffness
actuator(MASA) is presented. The MASA is developed for
rehabilitation of a knee joint of stroke patients.
Since high compliance requires high gain in active com-
pliance control, which leads to instability of the system,
for safer and more effective physical human-robot interac-
tions, wearable robots with passive compliance have been
studied by many researchers. In [1], a series elastic actu-
ator was introduced and analyzed, which was adopted in
an exoskeleton for load-carrying augmentation due to its
bandwidth for force control in [2]. Kwa et al. developed
an exoskeleton with joints with passive compliance to assist
patients to walk. The exoskeleton used Rotary Series Elastic
Acuators(RSEA’s) in [3].
In addition to enhancing human power, exoskeleton robots
with compliance are used in rehabilitation of patients. A

robotic exoskeleton for gait rehabilitation using series elas-
tic actuators was developed and discussed in [4] and [5].
Because of the spring used in the actuators, a force control
problem became a position control problem and the actuator
had better resistance in case of impact.
In [6], beneﬁts and limitations of series elastic actuators
were discussed, among which stiffness limitation was in-
cluded. It leads to studies on joints with variable stiffness
by many researchers. In [7], force of springs, which pressed
rollers against cam disk, was changed to realize stiffness
variation of the actuator. The designed variable stiffness joint
was used to actuate a 4-DOF manipulator. In [8], leaf springs
were used to generate the compliance of the actuator. One
actuator controlled the location of the resting position and
the other actuator changed the tension of the spring, which
resulted in changes in stiffness. The actuator was designed
for more energy efﬁcient walking and running in legged
locomotion. In [9], the output stiffness of the joint was
changed by adjusting transmission ratio using a lever arm of
variable effective length. In [10], a mechanical impedance
adjuster was designed for a robot manipulator. In order to
change stiffness of the joint, the effective length of the leaf
spring was changed using a lead-screw mechanism.
In antagonistic conﬁguration, nonlinear springs were nec-
essary to change stiffness of the joint. In order to realize
nonlinear springs, rolamite springs were used in [11] since
nonlinearity of the spring depends on the shape of the spring.
Tonietti et al. used a timing belt and linear springs to realize
nonlinear springs in [12]. Since the power of the motors
were transmitted through the timing belt, the strength of the
belt limited the maximum allowable payload. The existence
of the idle pulley made the joint bulky. To overcome such
disadvantages, another design was presented in [13]. The
presented VSA-II used a four-bar linkage system to transmit
the power, which showed more robustness and larger load
bearing capability. Using 4-bar linkages and leaf springs, the
stiffness of the joint was varied via changing the effective
length of the springs in [14]. It had limitations in reducing
its volume and weight since the leaf spring was attached to
the axis in radial direction.
In [15], a powered elbow exoskeleton for rehabilitation
was equipped with a variable impedance antagonistic actu-
ation system. For variable stiffness, nonlinear springs were
connected to the joint through cable transmission. In [16],
an active variable stiffness exoskeleton robot system was
introduced. In order to change the stiffness of the system,
the effective length of the leaf spring was changed using a
motor.

In this paper, a mechanically adjustable stiffness actuator
is presented. It is designed for an exoskeleton for rehabil-
itation of stoke patients. Stiffness of the actuator is varied
by changing the effective length of cantilever springs which
is attached to the axis in the axial direction through a
torque limiter. A double-tripod parallel mechanism is used
to change stiffness of the spring. Due to the torque limiter
which is released when an external torque greater than pre-
set threshold value, excessive torque is not transmitted from
and to the link. A concept of the rehabilitation robot for
knee joint using the MASA is introduced. By changing the
stiffness of the MASA, the amount of assistance by the robot
was adjusted.
In Section II, the design of the MASA is explained. Using
the double-tripod parallel mechanism, the MASA changes
the effective length of the cantilever springs, which results
in stiffness change. Stiffness of the MASA is derived in
Section III. In Section IV, controlling stiffness and position
of the MASA is explained. A robot for knee rehabilitation
using the MASA is introduced in Section V. Experimental
result is presented in VI and conclusion follows in VII.
II. DESIGN OF MASA
This section explains the design of the MASA. The
MASA consists of a double-tripod parallel mechanism, three
identical cantilever springs, and a torque limiter. The double-
tripod parallel mechanism is composed of two “input bases”
and one “output plate,” which is located between the input
bases. While the input bases rotate about an axis without
translational movement along the axis, the output base makes
rotational and translational movements with respect to the
axis. Each input base is connected to the output plate with
three rigid links via universal and ball joints, see Fig. 1.
The lengths of the rigid links are greater than a half of the
distance between the input bases. Therefore, relative angular
positions of the input bases determines the translational
location of the output plate. The input bases are actuated
by two identical actuators.
Fig. 1. Schematics of the double-tripod parallel mechanism and a cantilever
spring. For simplicity, only one spring is shown.
The output plate has openings with two rollers. The
cantilever springs are inserted through the openings and
held by the rollers. “Spring holder,” to which the other end
of each spring is attached, rotates freely about the axis.
However, it does not move along the axis. Note that since
the distance between the input bases remains constant, the
location of the output plate along the axis is determined
by the relative angular displacement of the input bases.
Therefore, the effective length of the cantilever springs,
which is the distance between the output plate and the
spring holder, is changed as the angular displacement of the
actuators changes. The torque limiter consists of balls and a
Fig. 2. Design of the torque limiter. There are detents for the balls on the
surface of the spring holder. When excessive torque is applied, the torque
pushes the balls out of the detents to make the torque limiter released.
linear coil spring. The balls are held by “ball-pusher.” The
ball-pusher is free to move along the axis but it does not
make any relative rotational movement with the axis. The
ball-pusher is pushed against the spring holder by the pre-
compressed coil spring. There are detents for the balls on
the contacting surfaces of the spring holder, see Fig. 2.
When an external torque is less than the threshold, the
spring holder and the ball-pusher are engaged, connecting
the cantilever spring and the axis together. If the external
torque at the axis is greater than the threshold, the balls in
the detents are pushed out of the detents and the ball-pusher
becomes free to rotate. Then, the axis rotates independent of
the spring holder, preventing an excessive torque from and
to the axis is transmitted. The threshold is determined by
the spring force of the coil spring.
Fig. 3. Designed MASA. It is actuated by two identical electrical motor
and harmonic gears.
Designed MASA is shown in Fig. 3. The input bases are
actuated by electrical motors with harmonic gears. Since the
3385
load at the axis is shared by the actuators, the required torque
from the actuators is reduced, which results in reduction of
the actuators in size and weight.
III. STIFFNESS OF THE JOINT
Stiffness of the MASA is determined by the effective
length of the three identical cantilever springs. The effective
length of the spring is deﬁned as the distance between the
spring holder and the output plate, which is controlled by
two identical actuators.
Let l
e
be the effective length of the spring and let w
s
be the width of the spring. Let r
s
be the distance from the
center of the axis. Let t
s
be the thickness of the spring, see
Fig. 4. Then, since there are three identical springs held by
Fig. 4. Schematics of the cantilever spring and axis
the spring holder, the force at the end of each spring due to
the external torque is as follows.
F =

stiffness as follows.

The torsional stiffness is changed if the effective length
of the spring varies. As the effective length of the spring
becomes smaller, the torsional stiffness becomes larger. Note
that since the maximum stiffness is not bounded, the range
of stiffness is determined by the minimum stiffness of the
MASA. Since the stiffness is determined by the shape of
the springs, it is possible to change the range of stiffness by
designing the cantilever springs (i.e. width, thickness of the
springs, etc.)
IV. CHANGING POSITION AND STIFFNESS
Since the resting position of the cantilever spring is the
angular position of the output plate and the stiffness of the
MASA depends of the location of the output plate along the
axis, it is necessary to calculate the position of the output
plate.

V. KNEE REHABILITATION ROBOT WITH MASA
The concept of rehabilitation robot with MASA is shown
in Fig. 6. A shank of a patient is ﬁxed with a link, which is
actuated by the MASA. The resting position of the MASA
is controlled to track a desired trajectory with different
stiffness. Due to the springs, the patient is allowed to move
away from the desired trajectory. The patient is asked to
follow the joint trajectory while the performance of the
patient, which is the actual position of the link, is shown
on the display. If the patient moves away from the desired
trajectory, torque by the spring helps the patient to follow
the trajectory. The amount of assistance is determined by
the stiffness of the MASA. According to the performance
of the patient, the stiffness of the MASA is adjusted by the
therapist.
Fig. 6. Concept of rehabilitation robot. Shank of a patient is attached to
MASA through a link.
Note that because of the springs and the torque limiter,
physical safety of the patient is ensured in case of unex-
pected involuntary muscle activities such as spasticity during
the session.
VI. EXPERIMENT
The implemented MASA is shown in Fig. 7. Two input
bases are actuated by two identical electrical motors through
harmonic gears and timing belts. The gear ratio of the
harmonic gear is 100:1 and the pulley for the timing belt is
3:1, which makes the overall gear ratio to be 300:1. Power of
each electrical motor is 200W. Estimated maximum torque
at the output shaft of the MASA is 64.77Nm. Since the
average torque produced by a knee during walking is 34.74
Nm [17], The MASA generates sufﬁcient torque for knee
rehabilitation exercise. Detailed model parameters are listed
in Table I.

MODEL PARAMETERS OF THE IMPLEMENTED MASA

motors with harmonic gears. Each input base is connected to the output
plate using three rigid links.
Fig. 8 shows the experimental setup to evaluate the
MASA. The MASA is attached to a link through a torque
sensor, which measures the external torque applied at the
axis. The positions of the axis and the actuators are measured
by the encoders.
Fig. 8. Experimental setup. A link that is not shown in the ﬁgure is
attached to the axis through a torque sensor in order to measure the torque
at the axis. An encoder is connected to the axis for position measurement.
Estimation of torque by the springs is shown in Fig. 9.
The position of the axis is measured using the position
encoder while external torques are applied to the axis of the
MASA with different angular displacement of the actuators.
For estimation, the measured link position and torque data
are ﬁtted with linear functions. As the angular displacement
of the MASA becomes larger, the effective length of the
cantilever springs becomes longer, which results in lower
stiffness of the MASA. Maximum stiffness of the MASA is
173Nm=rad and minimum stiffness is 71Nm=rad. Max-
imum angular displacement of the actuators is 0:72rad,
which is limited by the dimensions of the cantilever springs
and the rigid links connecting the input bases and the output
plate.
Frequency response of the MASA is shown in Fig. 10 and
Fig. 11. Frequency response of the position of the MASA is
in Fig. 10.The 3dB cutoff frequency is 2.4Hz. Fig. 11 shows
the frequency response of stiffness of the MASA. The 3dB
cutoff frequency is about 4.5Hz.

of the torque limiter is shown in Fig. 12. An external torque

is applied at the link until the torque limiter is released
while the external torque is measured by the torque sensor.
The measured threshold is about 10Nm. When the torque
limiter is released, the external torque is not transmitted from
and to the axis, which makes the measured external torque
converges to zero. The link becomes free to rotate if the
torque limiter is released.

with MASA. A link with a brace, where the shank of the

patient is ﬁxed, is actuated by the MASA.
For experiment, a mass is attached to the link, which is
moved by the MASA to follow a sinusoidal trajectory. Based
on the estimation of human shank in [18], the mass and
the position of the mass are determined to be 2.5kg and
0.2m from the knee joint, respectively. The frequency of the
trajectory is 0.3Hz and the magnitude is about 23 degrees.
Due to the range of motion of the knee, the trajectory is
offset by 50 degrees. The positions of the link is measured
with 5 different stiffness. Fig. 14 shows the trajectory of the
link with different stiffness of the MASA. As the stiffness
becomes smaller, the error becomes larger, which indicates
lower stiffness of the MASA allows more freedom for the
patient to move away from the desired trajectory. Therefore,
the stiffness of the MASA changes the amount of assistance
by the robot.
Fig. 15 shows the position of the link when human muscle
is activated. A male subject wore the robot and was asked not
to generate any torque at the knee. After a while, the subject
was asked to activate the muscle to follow a sinusoidal
trajectory with frequency of 0.2Hz and magnitude of 0.4rad.
When the muscle was activated, the trajectory error was
reduced without changes in stiffness of the MASA due to
the torque generated by the subject. The torque necessary
to reduce the error was generated by the subject and was
proportional to the error, which was directly related to the
stiffness. Therefore, it was possible to vary the amount of

VII. CONCLUSIONS
This paper presented the Mechanically Adjustable Stiff-
ness Actuator(MASA) with a torque limiter for a knee
rehabilitation robot. The MASA consisted of a double-tripod
parallel mechanism, cantilever springs, and a torque limiter.
Input bases of the double-tripod parallel mechanism, which
were connected to output plate with rigid links, were actu-
ated by two identical electrical motors with harmonic gears.
Since the output plate hold one end of each cantilever spring,
the position of the output plate determines the angular
position of the resting position and stiffness of the MASA.
The other end of each cantilever spring was connected to
the axis through a torque limiter, which was released when
an excessive external torque was applied at the axis.
Experimental results showed that stiffness of the MASA
was changed as the angular displacement of the actuators
was changed. The torque limiter was released by an exces-
sive torque applied to the axis and prevented the torque being
transmitted from and to the axis.
The robot using MASA for knee rehabilitation was intro-
duced. Since the amount of assistance by the robot decreased
as the stiffness of the MASA, the level of assistance was
possible to be adjusted with the stiffness according to the
patient.
