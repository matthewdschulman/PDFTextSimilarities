Abstract— This paper presents the preliminary studies ded-
icated to the design of cable-driven parallel robots (CDPRs)
for industrial purposes. The goal is to transport the proper
tools around a jacket, an offshore structure supporting a
wind turbine, in order to perform painting and sandblasting
tasks. In this paper, a simpliﬁed case study consisting of
a structure composed of four tubes is investigated. A fully
constrained CDPR and a suspended CDPR are studied. The
design problems of the CDPRs at hand are formulated as
optimization problems. They aim at determining the locations
of the base anchor points of the cables that minimize the size
of the CDPR, while satisfying a set of constraints. Those
constraints guarantee that the moving platform can support the
external wrenches and that there is no interference between the
cables and between the cables and the environment, all along
the path to be followed by the moving platform.
I. INTRODUCTION
Nowadays part of the worldwide energy production comes
from renewable sources: offshore wind turbines represent a
leading technology in the renewable energy sector [1]. They
can be installed in the sea through different supports, like
jackets (offshore ﬁxed structures, as illustrated in Fig. 1).
Due to their shape and size, the fabrication of jackets is
complicated and requires non standard procedures. The study
of efﬁcient technological processes aims at producing these
structures in series and at limiting the risks for operators. In
this context, the IRT Jules Verne is cooperating with STX
Europe to investigate and develop a Cable Driven Parallel
Robot (CDPR) in order to perform painting and sandblasting
operations on jackets.
CDPRs can represent an appropriate technological solution
for the considered tasks. Indeed, CDPR are able to cover
wide spaces and their payload to weight ratio is usually very
high. They are relatively cheap and can be designed in such
a way to be reconﬁgurable and therefore adapted to different
tasks.
Although no CDPR has already been designed for the
application considered in this paper, research works have al-
ready been performed in similar sectors, like the naval, aero-
nautic and civil engineering ones. Albus et al. developed, at

the beginning of the 90s, the NIST RoboCrane [2], a CDPR
able to perform several industrial operations, like painting of
military aeroplanes and displacement of heavy payloads. In
2001 Holland and Cannon ﬁled the patentUS6826452B1 [3].
They proposed a robotic system composed of four cranes to
be employed as a CDPR for cargo transportation. Currently,
several research institutes and companies are involved in
the framework of the European Project CableBOT that aims
at developing modular and reconﬁgurable CDPRs able to
perform different operations during the fabrication of large-
scale structures [4]. CDPRs can be employed also for other
large workspace applications, e.g. the broadcasting of sport
events [5], [6] and rescue operations [7].
This paper presents a preliminary design study of a CDPR
transporting the tools necessary to perform painting and
sandblasting operations on a jacket. The designs of a fully
constrained CDPR and a suspended CDPR are investigated.
Due to the complexity of a real jacket, the analysis is applied
on a simpliﬁed structure made up of four tubes, as illustrated
in Fig. 2. This context represents a new challenge since it
introduces several constraints into the design problem. Due
to the cluttered industrial environment, interferences between
the cables and the environment need to be taken into account.
The cable tensions and the positioning precision of the CDPR
are constrained as well. In this paper, the design problem is
formulated as an optimization problem, aiming at minimizing
the size of the CDPR.
The paper is organized as follows: Section II describes the
industrial context and the problem formulation. Section III
introduces the CDPR models. Section IV presents the
design of a fully constrained CDPR for the given case
study. Section V describes the design of a suspended CDPR.
Section VI concludes the paper and presents our future work.

II. PROBLEM DESCRIPTION
A jacket is an offshore structure composed of several tubes
as shown in Fig. 1. One jacket has already been realized
by STX Europe. It has a base of 30 m 30 m, an height
of 60 m and a weight of 1000 T. The upper part of the
jacket, which remains outside the water, is 20 m high. This
part should be painted and sandblasted, to be protected from
oxidation. STX Europe planned to automatize part of the
industrial process in order to produce several units per year.
The technical solution proposed in this paper consists in
painting and sandblasting the structure by means of proper
tools mounted on a CDPR platform: the Centre of Mass
(CoM) of the CDPR follows a path along the jacket tubes
approaching the tools to the jacket itself. When the CDPR is
in the correct pose, the tools can perform the required tasks.
Due to the complexity of the problem, a simpliﬁed case
study is introduced. Painting and sandblasting operations
have to be performed on a four-bar tubular rigid structure.
The structure is centered in an absolute reference frame,F
b
,
of origin O
b
and axes x
b
, y
b
, z
b
, as shown in Fig. 2. It has
an height,h
s
, of 10 m and a width,w
s
, of 5 m. The diameter
of the tube, 
s
, is equal to 50 cm.
The design problem can be summarized as follows. The
CDPR cable exit point positions have to be determined.
The CDPR should be able to follow a proper path to let
the embarked painting and sandblasting tools perform the
required operations along one side of the four-tube structure.
The other side can be painted by a similar CDPR. Both the
paths are illustrated in Fig. 2. They are 80 cm far from the
structure. The CDPR should avoid cable interferences and
collisions between the cables and the environment (here, the
four-bar tubular structure). The cable tensions must respect
given limits. The CDPR must be fully constrained during
the operations, or at least in static equilibrium (in the case
of a suspended design). The CDPR should be as compact as
possible.
III. GEOMETRIC AND STATIC ROBOT MODELS
A CDPR is composed of a mobile platform, a support
structure (the base) andm cables. Two reference frames are
considered: the ﬁxed base frame,F
b
, presented in Section II,
and a platform frame,F
p
, of originO
p
and axesx
p
,y
p
,z
p
.

same geometric description can be applied to a fully constrained CDPR.
The exit point of the i-th cable on the base, A
i
, is de-
scribed, with respect toF

, through the Cartesian coordinate
vector a

i
;i = 1;:::;m. The platform connection point
of the i-th cable, B
i
, is deﬁned, with respect to F

, by
the Cartesian coordinate vector b

The moving platform pose,p, expressed inF

and the orientation angle vector  = [;; ]

respectively.
As illustrated in Fig. 3, the length of the i-th cable,

IV. FULLY CONSTRAINED CDPR DESIGN
The ﬁrst design problem aims at minimizing the size of a
fully constrained CDPR intended to paint a side of the tubular
structure. To perform this operation, the CDPR CoM should
follow the Path I shown in Fig. 2. The other side can be
painted by a symmetrically placed CDPR following Path II.
Each path is deﬁned by a discretized curveP, composed of
600 equidistant points P . The CDPR static equilibrium is
an important issue to take into consideration since the cables
cannot push the platform. Therefore, the CDPR equilibrium
can be satisﬁed only through positive cable tensions. The
required robot accuracy is also considered, as well as the
collisions between cables and between cables and the tubular
structure. These constraints must be veriﬁed for all points
P2P.
The optimization is performed on a CDPR with eight
cables, m = 8, which corresponds to the minimum even
number of cables for a fully constrained CDPR [8]. This
choice should maintain the design of the CDPR as simple
and cheap as possible. Steel cables are considered. They are
characterized by the following properties: diameter, 
c
, of
0:4 cm, Young Modulus equal to 100 GPa, elastic coefﬁcient
k of 1; 256 10
6
N=m and tension limit, 
max
, equal to
11 650 N. In order to simplify the problem, the layout of
points B
i
;i = 1;:::; 8 is predeﬁned. Points B
i
lie at the
corners of a parallelepiped, whose width,w
p
, length,l
p
, and
height,h
p
, are equal to 40 cm, 40 cm and 20 cm, respectively.
A. Design Variables
The decision variables of the optimization problem are
represented by the position vectors of points A
i
. To reduce
the number of variables, the points A
i
have been located at
the vertices of parallelepiped whose edges are parallel to the
axes x
b
, y
b
and z
b
. Hence, four variables, u
x1
, u
x2
, u
y

, are sufﬁcient to deﬁne the coordinates of pointsA

(18)
This objective function has been selected in order to mini-
mize the space occupied by the CDPR inside the workshop.
C. Constraints
The path to be followed by the CoM of the CDPR
platform should be included in the Wrench Feasible
Workspace (WFW) of the robot for the latter to be in static
equilibrium and controllable [9], [10]. The WFW is the set
of platform poses that are wrench feasible. A pose is wrench
feasible if the CDPR is able to balance any external wrench
within a given set, with non-negative cable tensions lying
in a given admissible interval [11]. Hence, for the pose of
the moving platform to be inside the WFW, the following
condition should be fulﬁlled,
8w
e
2 [w]
r
; 92 [] j W +w
e
= 0 (19)
where [w]
r
denotes the required wrench set, representing the
set of wrenches that can be applied on the CDPR platform.
Its boundaries have already been deﬁned in Eq. (7) and
Eq. (8). Their values are given in Table I. [] represents

[w]
r
and [] are deﬁned in different spaces, connected
through the static equilibrium equation by the wrench matrix.
The wrenches that can be generated by [], through Eq. (4),
is a zonotope, called the available wrench set, [w]
a
=
 W[]. In order to verify the wrench feasibility of the poses
belonging to Path I, the technique described in [12] and [13]
has been used. The algorithm veriﬁes that all the vertices of
[w]
r
are included in [w]
a
, [w]
r
 [w]
a
. According to [12]
and [13], this condition can be translated into verifying the
satisfaction of a ﬁnite set of linear inequalities:
Cwd; 8w2 [w]
r
(21)
Moreover, cable-cable and cable-structure potential colli-
sions are taken into account. Being given that two cables i
and j are represented as straight line segments, a possible
cable interference can be veriﬁed by computing the distance
d
cc
i;j
between the cables i and j. This distance d
cc
i;j
is
calculated by means of Lumelsky’s approach [14] and has
to be larger than the diameter,

For m = 8, the number of tests to be performed for each

of the four tubes k of the structure, cable-structure potential
collisions are tested by means of the distance d

between
the i-th cable and the k-th tube of the structure. The i-th
cable and the k-th tube do not collide when d

E. Optimum Fully Constrained CDPR Design
The previous optimization problem has been solved by
using the GlobalSearch Algorithm developed by Zsolt et
al. [16]. The optimum design is illustrated in Fig. 5. Table II
provides the design variables and objective function values
for the optimum fully constrained CDPR. This design is the
most compact one, as visible by the short distances between
the points A
i
along x
b
. This small distance prevents the
cables from interfering and represents an interesting technical
solution in terms of cable setting on the base.

V. SUSPENDED CDPR DESIGN
The second design optimization problem aims at ﬁnding
the positions of the cable exit and connection points that
minimize the size of a suspended CDPR intended to perform
the task detailed in Section IV. The chosen number of cables
is equal to six, i.e., m = 6. To simplify the problem, we
assume that no external wrench is applied on the moving
platform: only gravity is acting on the platform weighting
60 kg. The wrench produced by the platform weight is
deﬁned by the vector w
g
.
A. Design Variables
Unlike in Section IV , the length l
p
, the width w
p
and the
heighth
p
of the box-shaped moving platform are part of the
variables of the design problem at hand. The conﬁguration
of points B
i
has a higher inﬂuence, in terms of static
equilibrium, for suspended CDPR than for fully constrained
ones. The Cartesian coordinates of points B

C. Optimum Suspended CDPR Design
The optimum design of the suspended CDPR, solution of
problem (41), is shown in Fig. 7. The design variables and
the objective function values associated with this design are
given in Table III. Similarly to the optimum design of the
fully constrained CDPR, the distance between the connection
points, along x
b
, are reduced as much as possible, while
respecting the static equilibrium constraint. The robot is in
static equilibrium thanks to the gravity forces acting on the
moving platform. To balance any external wrenches belong-
ing to [x]
r
it would be necessary to increase the distance
between points A
i
along the axis x
b
, possibly generating
some collisions between the cables and the structure.

VI. CONCLUSIONS
This paper introduced a preliminary design study of CD-
PRs intended to displace painting and sandblasting tools
around jackets. This preliminary study considers a simpliﬁed
four-tube structure in place of a jacket.
The design optimization problem has been formulated
for a fully constrained CDPR considering the Cartesian
coordinates of points A
i
as design variables. A suspended
CDPR has been studied as well. The minimization of the
size of the CDPRs was the objective of both the optimization
problems. The size of the optimum fully constrained CDPR
is smaller than the size of the optimum suspended CDPR.
In the fully constrained CDPR, the connection points are
very close to each other along the axis x
b
. The optimum
fully constrained CDPR can assure the static equilibrium of
the robot in presence of relevant external wrenches, along
the x
b
and y
b
axes. However, the fully constrained CDPR
requires a higher number of cables than the suspended
CDPR. Furthermore, the suspended design frees the space
below the platform from cables. Overall, if the presence of
cable connected to the ground does not generate any issue,
the fully constrained solution should be preferred.
The results presented in this paper could be applied to
the design of a CDPR painting a single jacket side. The
painting and sandblasting of a full jacket may require some
reconﬁgurabilities. The study of reconﬁgurable CDPRs able
to work around a jacket is part of our future work.
