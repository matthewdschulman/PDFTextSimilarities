Abstract— This paper describes design and application of a 
novel counter-balancing stackable parallel mechanism. The 
stackable mechanism is designed by combining a five-bar and a 
couple of parallelograms. This design allows a compact design 
and wide workspace as compared to prior parallel type 
counter-balancing mechanisms. A linear geometry of this 
mechanism guarantees static balancing in the whole workspace. 
This mechanism was successfully applied to otologic.  
 
I. INTRODUCTION 
Counter-balancing mechanism has been widely employed 
to compensate for gravity load of links and resultantly increase 
the payload of the robot. Extensive applications can be found 
in automotive industry, industrial robot, service robot, home 
furniture, medical devices, construction, and so on.  
In the design of haptic mechanism, Lessard, et al [1] 
designed a 5-bar gravity-balancing parallel mechanism by 
using torsion springs at joints. Tahmasebi, et al [2] designed a 
5-bar parallel mechanism by using actuator as a 
counter-weight. Wang and Gosselin [3-4] designed 3-DOF 
and 6-DOF spatial parallel mechanisms by attaching a 
counter-weight and spring at some links and joints. Laliberte 
and Gosselin [5] investigated counter-balancing of a 3-DOF 
planar parallel mechanism in a similar manner. In the design 
of service robot, Park, et al. [6] designed a counter-balancing 
serial mechanism by attaching a spring at each joint. Herder [7] 
presented a design method for statically balanced spring 
mechanisms. 
Specifically, need for counter-balancing mechanism grows 
much in the area of medical devices. The medical microscope 
being used in operation room is such an example. Nakamura, 
et al [8-9] designed a gravity-balancing parallelogram 
mechanism by using an adjustable moment arm. Nakamura, et 
al [10] designed a gravity-balancing serial mechanism using 
timing belt by attaching a counter-weight at the end point of 
the lower link. Nakamura [11] designed a balancing chair for 
medical apparatus. In the design of rehabilitation devices, 
Agrawal and Agrawal [12] designed a gravity-balancing 
auxiliary parallelogram mechanism by using springs at some 
links and joints. However, most of previous works have not 
paid much attention to the open-loop stability under static 
equilibrium. Seo, et al [13] initially analyzed the open-loop 
stability of a counter-balancing parallel mechanism. A general

stiffness model was employed as a measure for open-loop 
stability. The zero stiffness is found an ideal case implying 
static equilibrium at all workspace.  
As an extension of Seo, et al [13], this paper aims at 
developing a novel counter-balancing mechanism, which has 
a larger workspace and ideal open-loop stability in terms of 
stiffness by employing stackable design architecture of 
kinematic linkages. Lee, et al [14] initially proposed such 
stackable design architecture in the design of slim 
end-effector for single port access surgery. However, the 
gravity load of the mechanism was not taken into account 
because of its small size and the whole structure was 
constructed only by stacking a couple of four-bar 
mechanisms. This paper proposes another type of stackable 
mechanism by combining a five-bar and a couple of 
parallelograms. This design allows a compact design as 
compared to the four-bar based design and provides a linear 
geometry which yields zero stiffness in the whole workspace 
(i.e., an ideal open-loop stability). 
The procedure of this paper is as follows. In section II, a 
new stackable mechanism is introduced. The kinematic and 
static models are derived in section III. In section IV, we 
propose a special design of the stackable mechanism for the 
otologic surgery. Workspace analysis and kinematic 
optimization are performed. A prototype was developed and 
tested using a phantom based on a patient’s data of temporal 
bone. Finally, we draw conclusion in section V. 
 
II. DESIGN OF COUNTER-BALANCING  
A. Stackable Parallel Mechanism 
Fig. 1 shows a stackable parallel mechanism. This 
mechanism is constructed by stacking one double 
parallelogram over one five-bar. This process can be 
continued by stacking a triple parallelogram over it. So, this 
stackable mechanism architecture has ‘Self-Similarity’ and 
‘Recursiveness’ characteristics. Thus, it can be extended to 
N-DOF mechanism in general.

B. Counter-Balancing 
Fig. 2 shows a 3-DOF (degree of freedom) stackable 
mechanism with counter-weights. Counter-balancing method 
is based on the joint space where counter-weights (

M ,

M ) can be hanged at some of the extended ends of 
proximal links (

noted that only three counter-weights and three extended link 
lengths can be chosen among 5 candidates, respectively, since 
the mechanism has 3-DOF. This choice depends on several 
design constraints of this mechanism.

B. Forward Kinematics 
Fig. 3 denotes the kinematic model of the stackable 
mechanism. Since the mechanism has 3-DOF, we can define 
three independent joints. Three proximal joints (

are decided as the independent joints and it is named as 
a

The rest joints are set as the dependent joints (

C. Statics 
A mechanism is said statically-balanced if the weight of 
links does not require any torque (or force) at the actuators 
under static conditions, for any configuration of the 
mechanism. A mechanism with constant potential energy for 
any possible configuration is also statically-balanced. Two 
approaches, namely counterweights and elastic elements 
(springs), can be used to obtain statically balanced 
mechanisms [16]. Counterweights adjust the center of mass of 
the mechanism to be constant in the direction of the gravity 
vector. In other words, counterweights adjust the gravitational 
potential energy of this system to be constant.  
For static balancing of the stackable mechanism, an 
effective torque to compensate for the gravity loads of the 
stackable mechanism should be derived. For this, we consider 
an open-chain model as Fig. 4 by cutting joints. Then, we 
obtain the effective torque for each open-chain and using the 
virtual work principle, we transfer the effective torques at all 
Lagrangian coordinates (all joints) to that at independent 
coordinates (active inputs).

can be expressed as those at independent joints.

 It is noted from Eq. (18) and (19) that all coefficients 
i
k
( 13 i? ) is constant. It is also noted that the static balancing 
condition of the stackable mechanism has nothing to do with 
the joint angles of the three independent coordinates, because 
we just need to manipulate three equations 
1 2 3
0 k k k ? ? ?
for static equilibrium. As a result, the counter-weights and 
extended link lengths can be sought. 
 
D. General Stiffness Modeling 
In a state of static equilibrium among actuator torques, 
gravity loads at links, and externally applied loads, the system 
tends to oscillate like a spring once the system is perturbed 
from its equilibrium state. Yi and Freeman [16] introduced a 
general stiffness model for general closed-chain mechanism 
driven by abundant number of actuators. Seo, et al [13] 
modified the general stiffness model by including the effect of 
counter-weight and employed the stiffness model to analyze 
the open-loop stability of the system. It was concluded that if 
the counter-balanced system yields a null stiffness matrix, the 
system results in zero resorting force upon perturbation. This 
feature is important in the design of passive hands-on devices, 
because the surgeon is able to control the mechanism freely in 
the 3-dimensional space without feeling any gravity load of 
the system.  
For the stackable mechanism, the stiffness model will be 
analyzed. In a state of static balancing, the effective torque 
with respect to the independent joints is zero (i.e., 
*
0
a
? ? ). 
Differentiating

It is noted that the first term of Eq. (21) is zero because the 
matrix [] C is always constant. The second term is also zero 
because [] C denotes counter-balancing condition of the 
mechanism and thus it is a null matrix. As a result, the 
stiffness matrix with respect to the independent joints is a null 
matrix. Physically speaking, the stackable mechanism not 
only maintains a static equilibrium at all workspace of this 
mechanism but also does not produce any restoring force 
upon any initial displacement (or perturbation). This is due to 
linear geometry of the stackable mechanism as noted in Eq. 
(18). Thus, we can interpret the static balancing problem as 
design of linear geometry problem. 
Using three equation given by 
1 2 3
0 k k k ? ? ? , three 
counter-weights and corresponding moment arms can be 
obtained. In this case, the other two counter-weights (i.e., 
(
15
, MM ) are set as zero values. 
IV. APPLICATION 
A. Target application 
The stackable mechanism introduced in this paper has 
many potential applications. We employ this mechanism as a 
positioner for precise otologic surgery. Fixing the angle 
6
? as 
3
2
?
 and adding one rotational joint 
0
? along the y-axis as 
shown in Fig. 7, the stackable mechanism produces 
translational 3-DOF motion while preserving the 
counter-balancing characteristic.  
 
Figure 6.  Translational 3-DOF model. 
At the distal end of the translational 3-DOF stackable 
mechanism, we can mount any end-effector for special 
2375
  
purpose. In the otologic surgery, we employ a drill as a tool to 
remove bones to reach to the target lesion inside the temporal 
bone. A rotational 3DOF was designed and mounted at the 
end of the translational mechanism to control orientation of 
the drill tool. Including the mass of the rotational device, the 
counter-weights and the extended link lengths can be decided. 
In this case, only two constraint equations (
12
0 kk ?? ) are 
taken into account for static balancing.  
Table I includes kinematic and dynamic parameters for 
simulation. The kinematic and dynamic parameters 
associated with the counter-weighting design are initially set 
as 
2 3 2
( 0.2, 1.5 , 250 , M M kg J mm ? ? ??
3
162.3 ), J mm ? though 
optimal parameters can be also sought for a specific task 
description.  The static balancing behavior of the stackable 
mechanism is verified using a commercially-available 
software called ‘DAFUL’ made of virtual motion Co [17]. It 
is shown from Fig. 6 that at all workspace the stackable 
mechanism sustains static equilibrium.

B. Implementation 
Human-robot collaboration approach has been popular for 
precise control. Steady-hand approach is a typical method to 
reflect the surgeon’s intention with assistance of robot [18]. 
However, the approach using such admittance-type robots 
driven by high-geared motor used for speed reduction and 
force amplification is too sluggish, compared to the 
operational speed of the drilled task performed by surgeon. 
For operation at high speed, gravity compensation and 
dynamic inertial load should be compensated in the robot 
design. Rather than using active type robots, we employ the 
proposed stackable mechanism, which is a passive type 
device but designed to satisfy operational requirements in 
otologic surgery by implementing static-balancing design and 
minimization of the total mass of the system.  
 The developed stackable mechanism is applied to 
mastoidectomy which is a surgical procedure that removes an 
infected portion of the mastoid bone. The roles of the robot in 
this task are defined as (i) tool holder, (ii) navigation sensor, 
(iii) brake. 
Otologic surgery requires high accuracy, because there are 
many important arteries and nerves located closely to the 
target. Thus, only a skillful doctor is allowed to perform the 
otologic surgery, since it is a very difficult surgery. 
Furthermore, a resident should have many experiences in 
order to make himself or herself familiar with the skill in the 
otologic surgery. However, chance of surgery is limited to 
novice surgeons. Thus, a surgical robotic system is required 
to help young surgeon train minimally invasive surgery while 
preserving safety in surgery. 
Navigation system is one of important components of the 
robotic system. Some of important organs inside the temporal 
bone (such as facial nerves and carotid artery) are invisible 
during surgery, because these parts are located under the 
mastoid bone. Thus, image-guided navigation and warning 
system help surgeon avoid damaging important organs inside 
the temporal bone. We developed forbidden-region virtual 
fixtures to prevent the drill bit from entering into forbidden 
regions of the workspace. For this, we develop a 3D facial 
nerve model based on the CT data of a patient and the 
forbidden-region containing the facial nerve and a margin of 
3 mm. 
Using the 3D model of the temporal bone based on a 
patient’s CT image, a human-robot collaboration control is 
performed and evaluated. Through the registration of the 
robot coordinate into the image coordinate, the surgeon was 
able to check if the drilling does not damage the important 
organs inside the temporal bone. Furthermore, using the 
warning algorithm, a safety problem could also be handled.  
Figure 8 is the system configuration of the otologic 
surgical robot system. The system consists of a surgical robot, 
an image-guided navigation software, and an optical tracker. 
In order to integrate the navigation system and the robotic 
system, a patient coordinate to CT-image coordinate 
registration is required.

The surgeon can monitor a target lesion, relevant organs, 
and the surgical drill in real-time by the image-guided 
navigation system. Fig. 9 is a navigation software including 
the warning algorithm. The warning algorithm helps the 
surgeon prevent the surgical drill burr from entering into 
critical organs. If the drill burr reaches to the critical organ, 
the warning algorithm is activated by flickering the 
navigation view with a warning sound. And the robot 
automatically stops by applying the magnetic brake installed 
at joints of the mechanism.

The static balancing of the mechanism helps the surgeon 
manipulate the tool attached to the distal end freely without 
feeling much resisting force. The attached video clip 2 
demonstrates that using the 6-DOF (3-DOF translational 
motion and 3-DOF rotational motion) device, the user was 
able to perform the mastoidectomy successfully with the aid 
of the navigation software. 
V. CONCLUSIONS 
Contribution of this paper is proposition of a new stackable 
mechanism which can be extended to N-DOF in general. The 
linear geometry of the stackable mechanism helps designing a 
counter-balanced mechanism. Through application to otologic 
surgery, usefulness of the stackable mechanism has been 
proven. Future work involves general applications of this 
counter-balancing mechanism and task-specific optimization.
