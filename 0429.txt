Cartesian-Space Control and Dextrous Manipulation for Multi-Fingered
Tendon-Driven Hand
Taylor Niehues, Julia Badger, Myron Diftler, Ashish D. Deshpande
Abstract? Dextrous object manipulation is a crucial task for
the hands of the space humanoid Robonaut 2 (R2), and requires
accurate control of ngertip positions and forces. We present
a novel Cartesian control for the ngers and thumb of the R2
hand. The controller is designed such that the singularities in
the ngers are avoided, and distal joint stiffness is added in the
thumb for full controllability. We then present a higher-level
object stiffness control law for explicit control of object position,
orientation, and grasp forces. The complete algorithm is tested
experimentally on the R2 hand, with results demonstrating
tracking performance and robustness against disturbances.
I. INTRODUCTION
Manipulating objects dextrously with a robotic hand is
challenging. A number of approaches have been explored
to achieve object manipulation, but this still is an open
research problem [1], [2], [3]. Our goal is to realize object
manipulation with the hand system of the space humanoid,
Robonaut 2 (Fig. 1).
Since contact with the ngertips is prominent during many
ne manipulation tasks, precise control of ngertip positions
and forces is critical. Cartesian stiffness control is a strategy
that implements a user-dened ngertip stiffness, creating a
linear force/position relationship in quasi-static situations [4].
For dynamic interactions, a Cartesian impedance controller
gives the ngertips a user-dened mechanical impedance as
it interacts with the environment [5]. Cartesian impedance
control has previously been implemented successfully in
robotic ngers, such as in the DLR Hand II [6]. From a
design perspective, tendon-driven actuation in robotic hands
results in lower nger inertias, a desirable trait, but also
presents the challenge of simultaneously controlling multiple
tendons.
The hands of the Robonaut 2 (R2) are designed to achieve
human-like grasping and manipulation in an unstructured en-
vironment, such as the International Space Station (ISS) [7].
The ngers and thumbs are tendon-driven to allow for remote
actuation and reduced nger size and weight. The primary
(index and middle) ngers and the thumbs each have n + 1
tendons forn joints, which leads to full nger controllability
(n = 3 for primary ngers and n = 4 for thumbs). While
this ?n + 1? tendon arrangement is attractive due to the

low actuator count and space requirement, it also results
in a complex control problem, especially for impedance
control. Thus far, a joint-space torque control law for the
individual R2 ngers has been developed [8] that solves the
tendon tension distribution problem and produces decoupled
motions in the joint-space. However, Cartesian control of the
ngertips has not yet been explored.
Once Cartesian control of the ngers is achieved, the
next challenge is to implement a higher-level coordinated
controller for object manipulation. This involves simultane-
ous control of multiple ngers. In the past, the R2 hands
accomplished grasping and manipulation tasks by generat-
ing nger joint trajectories specically for a given object.
This method requires complex path planning, and makes
it difcult to control contact forces. Here we present an
object-level control strategy which allows for better control
of grasp forces while avoiding both contact slippage and
unnecessarily high internal forces, and also gives us direct
control of object position without explicit nger position
commands. In addition, we use an object stiffness law to

provide safer environmental interactions and user-denable
stiffness properties in each Cartesian direction.
Previously, Lee et al. [9] used object stiffness control to
create a relationship between positions and forces in the
object frame for planar, tendon-driven ngers. Simulation
studies in [10], [11] present a control law for two-ngered
pinching grasps with rolling contacts, applied to both 2-
D and 3-D cases. Gabiccini et al. [12] used an algorithm
that integrates a computed torque law for three anthro-
pomorphically designed tendon-driven ngers grasping an
object by optimizing the tendon actuation to meet tension
constraints. An object impedance control strategy, as pre-
sented by Schneider and Cannon [13], allows for control of
the impedance behavior of the object using a grasp matrix
mapping. Prattichizzo [14] and Malvezzi [15] developed an
object-motion decoupled internal force controller to reduce
the effect of internal forces on object trajectory. Manipulation
experiments with an object impedance controller have been
performed for the DLR Hand II [16], [17] using direct-
drive joints and joint torque measurements. However, object
manipulation experiments have not been presented for the
tendon-driven DLR Hand-Arm System [2], a more difcult
control problem due to its complex tendon arrangement.
In this paper we present a Cartesian stiffness control
algorithm for the individual R2 ngers and thumbs and an
object-level stiffness controller for ne manipulation tasks.
We chose a Cartesian stiffness controller over an impedance
controller because damping and inertia are not signicant in
our control problem. It has been shown for the R2 nger
control that the parameters in the joint torque controller can
be easily tuned to produce a critically damped response [8],
which eliminates the need for damping controls. Also, the
nger inertias are small enough that inertia shaping is not
necessary [7]. In the nger Cartesian controllers, necessary
modications are made based on the R2 nger kinematics
(e.g. singularity avoidance), and force feedback is provided
solely by tendon tension sensors. The object-level stiffness
controller allows for explicit control of grasp forces and
object position and orientation, and is robust against impacts
and other disturbances and uncertainties. The complete al-
gorithm is tested experimentally on the R2 hand.
II. FINGER CONTROLLER
We rst design a Cartesian controller for the individual
R2 ngers and thumbs. This problem is divided into two
smaller control tasks: control of nger joint torques through
tension feedback, and implementation of a Cartesian stiffness
controller for regulation of both ngertip positions and
forces. Variables used can be found in Table I.
A. Joint Torque Controller
To control the nger joint torques, we use the joint-space
controller proposed in [8]. The actual joint torques  and
internal tension t can be found using sensed tension values,

B. Cartesian Stiffness Controller
For accurate control of ngertip positions and forces, we
would like to produce a ngertip Cartesian stiffness of the
form:
f
x;d
=K
x
(x

 x) (4)
where the ngertip position x is calculated from the joint
angles q using the forward kinematics. From a desired

applying the transformation

x;d
=J(q)

This dened stiffness is the foundation of the nger
Cartesian controllers, but it is slightly modied to t specif-
ically with the R2 thumb and primary nger kinematics.
The secondary ring and little ngers are both underactuated
(3 tendons to control 4 DOFs), and thus are not fully
controllable in Cartesian-space.

1) Thumb: In the case of the thumb, simply using the
Jacobian J(q) 2 R
34
to transform from 3-D Cartesian
forces to four joint torques leaves one uncontrolled internal
DOF. To address this, we explicitly control the thumb's distal
joint angle q
4
with a desired joint stiffness. Control of the
distal joint angle is useful during grasping and manipulation
tasks, allowing us to ensure that contact is being made with
the at pad of the thumb for a more stable grasp. This results
in a new joint torque formulation,

(6)
whereJ

is the thumb JacobianJ(q) with the last column

is the desired distal joint stiffness.
2) Primary Fingers: In the primary ngers, a singular po-
sition occurs when the ngertip is aligned with the proximal
yaw joint axis. At this singularity, movement of the yaw
joint produces zero change in the ngertip Cartesian position,
meaning the nger cannot produce lateral motions or forces.
Because the nger frequently moves through this singular
position and the yaw joint is already relatively ill-conditioned
due to its smaller joint radii, the controller tends to performs
poorly near this singularity. Therefore, we switched from
Cartesian control of lateral abduction/adduction nger mo-
tions to joint stiffness control of the yaw joint q

gain matrix for primary ngers and J
22
is the primary
nger JacobianJ(q) after removing the column representing
the yaw joint and the row representing the lateral Cartesian
direction. Using this reduced Jacobian, we will only specify a
Cartesian stiffness in two directions: the z-direction dened
as being orthogonal to the plane of the palm, and the y-
direction dened as being parallel to the plane of the palm
and orthogonal to the proximal exion/extension joint axis.
This produces more stable and controllable motions
throughout the nger's range of motion without hampering
our ability to control ngertip Cartesian position and force,
due to the simplicity of transforming from lateral posi-
tion/force to yaw joint angle/torque, and vice versa. Control
of the yaw joint also helps us more effectively manage the
location of the point of contact on the nger's surface during
environmental interactions, i.e. to avoid grasping an object
with the side of a nger.
To avoid singularity positions and to avoid hitting mechan-
ical hard stops at the joint limits, repelling torques are used
at each nger joint:

where q

are the joint limits, 

is the desired
safe distance, andk
i
is the repelling stiffness. This repelling
torque is added to the joint torques of the Cartesian con-
troller.
The total desired torques
d
calculated here will be passed
down to the joint-space controller in Sec. II-A. The gainsK
p
and k
d
in Eq. (3) are tuned to give the Cartesian stiffness
controller a critically damped step response.
III. OBJECT MANIPULATION CONTROLLER
The goal of the object manipulation controller is to ro-
bustly grasp and manipulate an object using the thumb and
two primary ngers. It is designed to produce 2-D motions
on a plane parallel to the palm of the hand.
We rst dene a stiffness force to be applied to the object.

position (x

tip positions, and the object angle  is dened as the angle
between the object position and thumb. The combination of
(x

o
;) denes the object's virtual position.
To nd the desired ngertip forces, we use the following
relation:
f

=W (x)f
c
(10)
where W (x) is the grasp matrix and f
c
2R

represents the
2-D contact forces at each of the three ngertips.
Finding the inverse relation requires the generalized pseu-
doinverse W
+
(x), along with the null-space matrix N(x)
containing the internal forces. Simply calculating the null-
space of W (x) results in N(x) 2 R
63
, which would
require controller optimization of three separate internal
force variables. To reduce the null-space, we introduce an
additional constraint that the line of action of the internal
forces must pass through the object's center. These internal
forces would act in the same directions as those produced
by the passivity-based object controller of Wimboeck et. al.
[16], which uses virtual springs connecting each ngertip to
the center of the object. For more complex object shapes,
different constraints may be chosen by the user depending
on geometry and task requirements.
For example, a constraint for the thumb would be:

way, we set up a similar constraint row vector C

either one of the primary ngers, such that C

The internal force component, , is calculated such that the
minimum normal force being produced at the three ngertips
is greater than some prescribed minimum force f

.
The desired contact forces f
c
are then converted into
desired ngertip positions using Eq. (4) for the each nger's
Cartesian control loop. For example, given a desired endpoint
forcef
x;ij
for ngeri in the Cartesian directionj, the desired
Cartesian position x

is found as:

be passed down to the corresponding Cartesian controller in
Sec. II-B.
For the thumb, the commanded distal joint positionq

is
set to an angle ideal for maximum contact area on the thumb
pad. For the primary ngers, the total torque required at the
base to produce the desired ngertip force would be

where r is the vector from the nger base to the ngertip.

(16)
and passed down to the Cartesian controller. The ability to
control the yaw angle explicitly proves to be an important
feature to ensure that the three nger contact points remain
sufciently spread out to maintain a quality force-closure
grasp. The ngertip positions are also modied for stability
purposes. For example, the internal force component is not
allowed to drive the commanded ngertip positions past the
object's center, so that if the object slips or is dropped, the
ngers will simply come together and stop.
The higher-level object manipulation controller will pass
down commanded Cartesian positions x
d
, primary yaw joint
angles q
1d
, and thumb distal joint angles q
4d
to the nger
Cartesian stiffness controllers.
IV. EXPERIMENTAL MANIPULATION RESULTS
The object manipulation controller is implemented on the
Robonaut 2 hand. A diagram illustrating the overall control
structure is found in Fig. 2. Individual nger Cartesian
controllers, combined with joint-space controllers to deter-
mine output motor positions, are implemented in a lower-
level control loop communicating with the motor controllers
at a rate of 500 Hz. The higher-level object manipulation
controller runs on a separate computer running the R2 control
GUI, which sends nger position commands down to the
low-level controller at a rate of 50 Hz.
This relatively slow communication rate would result in
instability without the inherent stability provided by the
lower-level nger Cartesian controllers. This communication
hierarchy shows a structure similar to human hand neuro-
muscular control: the communication rate of neural signals
between the brain and the hand is slow (<10 Hz [18]), but
the inherent stability and stiffness properties of the individual
ngers (due to muscles, tendons, ligaments, joint capsules,
etc.) allow robust manipulation abilities.
The control law is evaluated using a step rotation com-
mand about the object's z-axis and step commands in the

x and y translational directions. In addition, disturbance
rejection experiments are performed to test the controller's
robustness and ensure the desired object stiffness is being
produced. For all cases, the desired object height above the
palm is set to a constant value, such that the nger and object
motions remain in a 2-D plane parallel to the palm. The
object is a standard 0.04 kg racquetball with a radius of 57
mm.
By using a simple ball as an object, the grasp matrix can
be easily approximated; for more complex object geometries,
analysis may be needed to dene a suitable virtual object
frame and to dene internal force constraints that work to
keep the contact forces within their respective friction cones.
For these experiments, the object's position shown in plots is
its virtual position. Recording the actual position of the ball,
i.e. through a motion capture system, will be part of future
work to conrm controller performance.
The joint-space torque feedback gain K
p
in Eq. (3) is
determined experimentally for each nger to produce accu-
rate joint torque tracking and internal tension maintenance;
slight variations in K
p
between the R2 ngers is neces-
sary primarily due to tension sensor calibration errors. The
damping gain k
d
is set to 0:01. The remaining controller
parameters used in the experiments can be found in Table II.
The prescribed nger stiffness in thez-direction is larger than
in other directions to help maintain the ngertips' positions
on a xed 2-D plane above the palm.
A. Object Rotation
The object is rotated about the z-axis by giving a step
input of  = 1:0 rad (Fig. 3). The steady-state error in
object angle and x occurs because the primary ngers both
reach their yaw joint angle limits, causing the controller to
compromise between the errors in x and object angle.
B. Object Translation
We perform object translation in the x-direction (laterally)
by commanding a step input from from x = 10 mm to
x = 25 mm (see Fig. 4), where the point (x;y) = (0; 0)
is located at the base of the middle nger. We once again see

steady-state errors in x and object angle due to the primary
ngers reaching their yaw joint limits.
Next, we test a step command in the y-direction of y =
10mm toy = 30mm, as shown in Fig. 5. We see minimal
errors in x or object angle, and negligible steady-state error
iny. The slower rise time moving in the positive y-direction
is a result of the thumb overcoming the grip forces being
applied the two primary ngers, which must remain fairly
high to maintain contact without slipping.
C. Disturbance Response
The disturbance response is analyzed to show the ro-
bustness of the controller. An external force is applied to
the object, as shown in Fig. 6, and the resulting position
and tendon tensions were recorded. The advantages of this
object stiffness controller over a more straightforward po-
sition controller is the ability to react to disturbances and
continuously modify the ngertip forces to maintain a stable
grasp. Note that the controller parameters were adjusted (see
Table II) for a lower object stiffness and higher internal
forces to give clearer experimental results and reduce contact
point slippage. The algorithm is able to maintain the desired
posture effectively with an acceptable steady-state error.
The forces being applied to the object, calculated from the
recorded tendon tensions and shown in Fig. 6(c), correspond
approximately to the desired object stiffness. The internal

forces in Fig. 6(d) are dened as the projected component
of ngertip forces passing through the center of the ball,
producing a normal gripping force. There are intervals when
the internal thumb force drops below the threshold; this
occurs because the disturbance is in reality being applied to
the thumb and not directly to the ball, skewing thumb force
values in the negative direction. At all other times, the desired
minimum grip force of f
grip;min
= 0:5 is maintained. Note
that the tension sensors have an error of 5-10% caused by
friction and interactions between tendon conduits [7], which
limits the controller's performance and precision.
V. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper we have presented a Cartesian stiffness
control law for the ngers and thumb of the R2 hands and an
object-level control for ne manipulation tasks. The Carte-
sian controller builds upon the existing joint-space controller
with a number of novel additions and modications. We
developed a hybrid Cartesian and joint stiffness control law
such that singularities are avoided in the primary ngers
and distal joint stiffness is added in the thumb for full
controllability. The proposed controller allows for an intuitive
control of ngertip positions and forces using only tendon
tension sensors as force feedback, and explicit control of key
joint angles (primary nger yaw joints, thumb distal joints)

that are important in manipulation tasks for ensuring good
contact areas and stable grasps. We then implemented this
controller as part of a higher-level object controller for multi-
ple ngers performing ne manipulation tasks. The ngertip
positions were used to dene a virtual object position on
a 2-D plane above the palm, which was subsequently used
to implement an object stiffness control law. This controller
was implemented on the R2 hand, and experimental results
demonstrate stable grasping, smooth object motions, and
robustness against disturbances.
The requirements on the R2 hand are broad and chal-
lenging. Various ne manipulation tasks are required on the
ISS, such as pulling and turning knobs on a task board
and using space tools (see Fig. 1). This paper introduces
novel control strategies that take full advantage of R2's well-
designed hardware and sensing capabilities. Future work will
include the utilization of 6-DOF force/torque sensors located
in the ngertips to allow for more precise control of ngertip
forces, faster movements, and expansion of the object-level
controller to 3-D motions.
