Filling the Gap between Low Frequency Measurements
with Their Estimates
Yuquan Wang, Dragan Kosti« c, Sven T.H. Jansen, and Henk Nijmeijer
AbstractÑ The use of redundant sensors brings a rich diver-
sity of information, nevertheless fusing different sensors that
run at vastly different frequencies into a proper estimate is
still a challenging sensor fusion problem. Instead of using the
size-varying measurements and thereby the size-varying Þlters
during each sampling period, we propose to Þnd a substitute of
the unavailable low frequency measurements such that we can
avoid using different sampling frequencies in one Þlter. In the
gap between the sampling of two low frequency measurements,
the use of these substitutes produces smoother estimates. In both
the proof of concept simulation and the localization experiment
performed on an indoor soccer robot, our proposed approach
exhibits an improved performance compared to the size-varying
Kalman Þlter methods.
I. INTRODUCTION AND RELATED WORK
Sensor fusion combines different sources of measurements
into a more reliable and accurate estimate of the physical
quantity. This is important for applications that involve re-
dundant sensors. When the sampling frequencies of different
sources of measurements are consistent, we can analyze the
cross correlation and apply different standard techniques, e.g.
[1] and [2]. However when the sensors operate at different
frequencies, the availability of the measurements is time-
varying. If the sensors are asynchronous, this availability
is even aperiodic. These uncertainties pose additional re-
quirements on the Þlter to produce stable and accurate
estimate. Approaches dealing with measurements at different
frequencies could be roughly divided into two categories:
Switching Scheme and Fusion Scheme. We will brießy review
these two categories, introduce our Þlling method and then
relate it to the existing approaches. In addition to a proof of
concept comparative simulation, we also validate it through
experiments on real soccer robots.
A. Switching Scheme
Methods in this category adapt the Þlter size to the
time-varying aperiodic measurements size at each sampling
period. Intuitively, when the low frequency measurement
appears, we augment the observation matrix and when it dis-
appears we switch the observation matrix back. Depending
on the Þlter type there are in general two ways:

1) Kalman Filter Approach: One generic Kalman Þlter
(both extended Kalman Þlter (EKF) and unscented Kalman
Þlter (UKF)) based switching scheme method is presented in
[3], where the fusion of vision and inertial sensor measure-
ments is examined. This method is ßexible and easy to be
implemented. Nevertheless, as a consequence of the switch-
ing, the dimensions of the Kalman gain and the covariance
matrix are aperiodic time-varying. Compared to the EKF
stability proof, e.g. [4], how this variability inßuences certain
conditions like observability, continuity and matrix inverta-
bility is not examined. Besides, switching of the covariance
matrix drops pre-calculated information when shrinking and
introduces initial guess when augmenting. Therefore each
time when schriking happens it requires an stablization
period for the Þlter to converge and when augmentting it
may produce discontinuity due to the different noise level.
If we plot the estimate against the ground truth we could
observe overshoot (undershoot) kind of discontinuity, which
is difÞcult for both control and estimation.
2) Particle Filter Approach: Compared with a Kalman
Þlter, particle Þlters incorporate multi-rate measurements in
a more straightforward way. The particle Þlter runs at the
highest possible frequency and awaits the arrival of a new
measurement. Whenever the new measurement arrives, the
particle Þlter will start the distribution derivation and re-
sampling. Such an example is available in [5], where a land
vehicle positioning application is examined. This approach
inherits the disadvantages of a particle Þlter, for example, the
problems about dimensionality and variance. Though some
work have been done to reduce the dimensionality [6] of a
particle Þlter, no such clear efforts have been made for a
particle Þlter dealing with multi-rate measurements.
B. Fusion Scheme
Alternative to the use of a size-varying Þlter, we could also
fuse different measurements into one based on the variance
information and use this fused estimate as the substitute of
all the measurements. According to [7], this sort of fusion
can take place on either the state or measurement level. In
the former case, we develop a separate Þlter for each kind
of measurement and in the latter we use the pre-calculated
measurement variance directly.
1) State Fusion: For each kind of measurement, we
develop one state estimate and its variance with a separate
Þlter. All the state estimates together build up the state
vector. The fusion performs upon the elements from the
state vector based on the corresponding variances. One well
known method of this kind is the Federated Kalman Filter

[8]. Because each measurement has its own state estimate,
State Fusion is considered to be a decentralized approach.
This feature leads to a reduce of the computational load on
the central processor and the communication cost. However,
this method is only effective when every measurement Þlter
is consistent with each other [9]. Discussions about the
coupling effects between measurements is available in a
series of publications starting from [14].
2) Measurement Fusion: Approaches in this category
fuse different measurements according to their pre-calculated
variances into a new measurement. Measurement fusion
uses the combined measurement as a substitute of all the
measurements. It requires that all of the measurements are
of the same kind or can be transformed to this such that
they are able to share the same observation function/matrix
for any post Þltering [9].
C. The Filling Method
The need of a switching scheme comes from the gaps
between the low frequency measurements. If we have sub-
stitutes of the unavailable low frequency measurements, we
can avoid the switching. Such a substitute is found to be the
prediction of the unavailable low frequency measurement in
[12]. An auxiliary vector is used to hold the values of the
previous measurements. Then given these stored measure-
ments, an extrapolation of the unavailable low frequency
measurements is made with a Bezier curve. In another
example [11], vision and inertial measurements are fused
with the same approach. These methods essentially assemble
zero order hold (ZOH), Þrst order hold (FOH) and etc. Let
us deÞne methods of this kind as Multi-rate hold methods.
Such a method is also used in [13] and [15] to estimate the
side-slip angle of a vehicle. In [13] a Þrst-order or a second-
order curve is Þtted to the side-slip estimates in real time to
give predictions of the side-slip angles between each of the
GPS measurements. By and large, these methods are in lack
of future information, so the prediction leads to overshoots
when the real physical quantity is undergoing an abrupt
change, see Sec. IV.
Compared with the pros and corns of the existing methods,
the Þlling method works in the following way:
 It does not apply any size-varying Þlter.
 It estimates the unavailable low frequency measure-
ments using both the Bezier curve and the system
updates.
In this way, it resembles Multi-rate hold methods, but com-
bines additional future information and therefore produces
substitutes more close to the ground truth. For comparison
purposes, we brießy summarize characteristics of some of
the reviewed approaches in table I.
In order to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed
approach to a multi-rate sensor fusion problem, we select a
pair of sensory data and relate them under a Kalman Þlter
with the kinematic model introduced in [10]. This is not
an unique choice, as long as we were able to solve one
measurement from another, we are able to apply the proposed
approach.
II. PRELIMINARIES
In this section we Þrst introduce the mathematical nota-
tions that we will use throughout the paper and then describe
the aforementioned kinematic model.
A. DeÞnitions
We denote the low frequency measurement withu and the
high frequency measurement withv. We use bold symbol to
indicate a vector, for example,u means a vector ofu. We use
 to denote sampling period, e.g. 
u
and 
v
. We index the
time step ofu andv ask andj. In addition, we deÞne the ab-
solute time when sampling a speciÞc measurement at itsi-th
time step ast
u
(i) ort
v
(i). We use^and~to indicate estimate
and extrapolation, e.g. ^ u and ~ u denote the estimated and
extrapolated substitute of the low frequency measurement
u respectively. In line with the Kalman Þlter notation, we
denote the state of a Þlter asx and its update at the time step
k asx(kjk 1). We denote the measurement used for Kalman
Þlter calculation, its estimate and its observation matrix asz,
^ z and C respectively. We denote the state variance matrix,
the process noise variance matrix and measurement noise
variance matrix as Q, R and P respectively.
B. Kinematic Model
We adopt the kinematic model introduced in [10] to model
the underlying kinematic relation between the high frequency
measurement v and its bias as:
_ v = _ x +b
x
+!
x
; (1)
whereb
x
is the bias noise in v and!
x
is white noise linked
to v. Since x is to be estimated, we reformulate (1) as:
_ x = _ v b
x
 !
x
: (2)
If v is available, _ v can be calculated by, e.g. differencing.
As a matter of fact bias varies slowly, we modelb
x
with the
176
white noise through a low pass Þlter:
b
x
=
1
1 +Ts
; (3)
whereT is the time constant and is the driving white noise.
Re-formulating (3), the state equation of b
x
becomes:

(4) and (2) together build up the kinematic model, which
describes how the bias b

affects x.
III. PROBLEM FORMULATION
We select a pair of measurements with vastly different
frequencies to challenge the proposed approach. We visualize
them in Fig. 1. We can see that the encoder measurement
(blue line at 1000 Hz) drifts away from the high accuracy
vision measurements (dotted green line at 32 Hz) as time
accumulates. The encoder measurement is plotted using a
simple reset function. When the error becomes too large
(over 0:15m), the encoder measurement is reset (red circle)
to the vision measurement.
Fig. 1: Vision measurements, encoder measurements and estimate
from a Kalman Þlter.
As in this case the bias noise appeared in the encoder
measurement we use the kinematic model introduced in
Sec. II-B to relate it to the vision measurements. In Fig. 1
the position estimate (red line) is obtained by applying
the Kalman Þlter as described in [10]. This Kalman Þlter
runs state-update at the sampling frequency of v (1000 Hz)
and receive measurements at the sampling frequency of u
(32Hz). This approach gives estimates close to the real vision
measurements. However due to the use of two vastly different
frequencies, every time when u arrives the measurement
update produces a discontinuity as we can see from the saw-
tooth (gray box) on position estimate.
These discontinuities are not suitable for a control purpose.
Nevertheless we cannot adapt the position estimate to the
abrupt changes by tuning a Kalman Þlter. If we adjust the
pre-speciÞed noise level to eliminate these saw-tooth, we
may end up with discontinuities elsewhere and adapting the
position estimate only to the vision measurements eventually.
This motivates us to Þll in information in the gap between
the sampling of two low frequency measurements u, that is,
to have a substitute of u running at the same frequency as
v. We denote this substitute as ^ u and make it at the same
frequency as the high frequency measurementv such that the
underlying Þlter (e.g. a Kalman Þlter) is able to run state-
update and measurement-update at the same frequency.
IV. PROPOSED SOLUTION
In order to use as much information as possible, the sensor
fusion estimate is usually a combination across different
sources. For example, the measurement fusion [9] predicts
the fused measurement as a linear combination of each type
of measurement weighted by its pre-calculated variance. This
combination takes place in the dimension of sources of
measurements. For a high frequency substitute ofu we have
to look for a combination in the dimension of time instead.
Namely we want a combination of u in the past.
Such a combination found in [12] is as follows: if we store
the most recent N low frequency measurements u by time
order into a vectoru, we can extrapolate the unavailable ~ u at
a higher frequency with a Bezier curve. Suppose we chooose
~ u to be at the same frequency as v, ~ u(k) at the k-th time
step (of the high frequency measurement v) is
~ u(k) =
N
X
i=0
w

i;t
v


u(j i); (5)
where the weightw(i) will be explained in Remark 4.1 and
j is the time step of the latest u stored in u at the moment
when ~ u(k) is calculated.
Bezier curve is widely used to model smooth curves. The
generated curve is contained in the convex hull of its control
points. In (5), elements ofu are actually the control points.
In Fig. 2 we applied the extrapolation method (5) to a vector
of 10 vision measurements (dashed red circles) used in Fig. 1
and obtained a sequence of 30 extrapolated ~ u (blue dotted
line). If we use the Þnal position estimates ^ x (black line) and

for
comparison, we can see that (especially in the second half
of the blue dotted line) as ~ u is further away from the stored
vision measurements u (red circles) in time, ~ u gradually
drifts away from ^ x and u

. Similar phenomenon could
be found in [13] and [15] as well. This is due to the fact that
there is no control points ahead of ~ u.
We propose to use information from the high frequency
measurement v as an extra control point ahead of ~ u. In
177
case of a Kalman Þlter, the system update x

contains
all the information from the high frequency measurement
v. Since the measurement and state estimate are related
through the observation matrix as z(k) = Cx(k), we use
^ z(k) = Cx

as an additional control point at the k-th
time step (at the frequency of v) as:

frequency as ^ u(k) (high frequency) and the other elements in
^ u are updated at the same frequency as u (low frequency).
Apply (7) to the same vector of 10 vision measurements
(dashed red circles in Fig. 2), we obtain 30 newly predicted
^ u (the green dotted line in Fig. 2). Compared to the extrapo-
lated ~ u, the new ^ u does not drift away fromu

Remark 4.2: From a Þlter point of view, both the ex-
trapolation (5) and interpolation (7) behave like a moving
average Þlter. Based on the numerical values of the weights
shown in Fig. 2, we can see that (5) and (7) are kind of
exponential moving average Þlter, which produces artiÞcial
measurements at a certain frequency up to the user. 
To summarize the analysis so far and give a concise
answer to the problem raised in Sec. III, we formulate the
dual-frequency sensor fusion procedure into Algorithm 1. In
application, due to the varying transmission and computation
process, time delay and loss of data of the low frequency
measurementu are common, e.g. GPS, vision measurements
or data over the network. Both time delay and missing data
amount to a variability in the frequency ofu. As long as we
store the received low frequency measurements into u, we
can always estimate ^ u(k) on the ßy. One application example
dealing with these two problems using Algorithm 1 will be
brießy presented in Sec. VI-B.

V. PROOF OF CONCEPT COMPARISON
Sensor fusion is a long-standing topic. We need a quantita-
tive comparison to the existing methods mentioned in Sec. I.
In this section and the next, we are going to validate that
the proposed approach is a good estimator for sensory data
captured at vastly different frequencies through simulation
and application examples. The simulation data is chosen to
be similar to the dual-frequency sensory data shown in Fig. 1.
The low frequencyu runs at 32 Hz and the high frequencyv
runs at 1000 Hz. SpeciÞcally, through different simulations
the standard derivation 
b
of bias noise in v is around 0:2m
and the standard derivation
u
ofu goes from around 0:01m
to 0:2m. We use the variance

and root mean square (rms)
as the measures for the estimates.
As we can Þnd in table II when 

eters are chosen to be the same as in the last case. Despite
the loss of data, the position is successfully estimated. The
missing of 45 visual measurements from 63.5s to 64s only
has a marginal effect on the drift of the estimation and the
estimate is still smooth when vision measurements is once
again available.

VII. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
Given a pair of sensors running at vastly different fre-
quencies, the proposed solution Þlls the gap between the
low frequency measurements with their estimates and thereby
exhibits an improved performance compared with the other
Kalman Þlter based approaches.
In the future, we aim to work with a larger set of sensory
data at different frequencies. A proper starting point would
be the analysis of the noise characteristics of these sensory
data, see how they could potentially complement each other
like in the dual-frequency case.
