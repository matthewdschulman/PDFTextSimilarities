Coordinated Motion Control of Dual Manipulators For Handling a
Rigid Object with Non-negligible Deformation
Kazuhiro Kosuge, Kentaro Kamei and Takashi Nammoto
Abstract— In this paper, we propose a coordinated motion
control algorithm of dual manipulators for handling of an
almost rigid object but with non-negligible deformation. By
the proposed algorithm, an almost rigid object with non-
negligible deformation, such as a cardboard box, a plastic
case, etc., is held and manipulated by dual manipulators
stably without producing any vibrations. By deﬁning apparent
dynamics of dual manipulators for the interface force between
the object and its environment and the dissipative dynamics
for the internal force applied by the manipulators to the object
independently, stable manipulation is achieved. Experimental
results illustrate that the vibratory motion of the manipulated
object caused by non-negligible deformation is eliminated by
the proposed control algorithm while the apparent dynamics of
the manipulated object is realized.
I. INTRODUCTION
A lot of industrial robots have been used in factories
and have replaced human workforce for various tasks, but
human workers are still doing many tasks, which are too
complicated for a robot to realize, such as inspection of
inside of assembled products, packing of different kinds
of products, etc. Human workers execute such complicated
tasks using both arms in coordination in a dexterous manner.
Handling of a single object in coordination has been one of
the key issues for robots to execute such tasks like human
workers.
Much research has been done for the coordinated motion
control of multiple manipulators for handling of a single
object in coordination, and many control schemes have been
proposed so far. To control internal force that is applied on
the object has been validated when the object is grasped
by multiple manipulators. For example, Uchiyama et al.
applied hybrid position/force control scheme for coordinated
motion control of dual manipulators, where the motion of
dual manipulators is decoupled into the absolute motion and
the relative motion using a “Virtual Stick” concept [1]. Hsia
et al. applied impedance control scheme based on the internal
force to control cooperating manipulators without knowing
the dynamics of the object [2][3]. Khatib et al. discussed the
coordinate system describing the dynamics of the object for
the internal force and proposed a concept of a virtual linkage
[4].
On the other hand, the object that is grasped by multiple
manipulators should be moved to a certain position and
orientation even though it is passively controlled by using

compliant motion control depending on external force that
is caused between the object and its environment when
the multiple manipulators are used for the tasks such as a
peg-in-hole. To meet the requirement, the motion of each
manipulator should be generated by decomposing compliant
motion of the object that is speciﬁcally designed for the
task considering its environment [9]. In the design of the
compliant motion of the object, rotation center should be
located on tip of the peg to complete the task by using remote
center compliance (RCC) concept [6]. Kosuge proposed a
coordinated motion control algorithm of manipulators based
on impedance control of each manipulator, which controls
the apparent dynamics of the object for external force applied
to the object and the pose of the manipulated object [6][5].
To realize both of stable grasping of the object and
accurate positioning of the object by using compliant motion
control, a framework that simultaneously controls both of the
internal force and the external force has been presented [10].
The framework is effective, however, it cannot be employed
for the complicated task such as a peg-in-hole because design
of compliant motion of the object such as the location of the
rotation cetner has not been discussed.
Although many control schemes have been proposed so
far, most of the control methods for handling a single object
by multiple manipulators assume that the manipulated object
is completely rigid. Several control algorithms also have been
proposed for handling a ﬂexible object assuming that the
ﬂexibility of the object could be modeled precisely. The
modeling scheme, however, could be applied to a certain
class of objects [7]. In reality, most of objects, which we
need to handle, is not so ﬂexible but is not completely rigid.
Although it is not easy to model the deformation of such
objects, the deformation is not negligible for stable handling
of an object. In many cases, the deformation of the object in-
duces vibratory motions of the manipulators and often makes
the system unstable for a certain class of control parameters.
Actually, it is not an easy task to select appropriate control
parameters for stable object manipulation.
In this paper, we propose an alternative coordinated motion
control algorithm of dual manipulators that simultaneously
controls both of the internal force and the external force,
where compliant motion can be designed ﬂexibly. Besides,
the proposed algorithm has a capability to handle an almost
rigid object with non-negligible deformation.

II. CONTROL STRATEGY
In this section, we discuss a control strategy of dual
manipulators for handling of an almost rigid object with
non-negligible deformation. Let us consider packing of small
cardboard boxes into a large cardboard box. This is a typical
example of dual arms coordination for shipping products
such as electronic devices. Automatization of the task is
strongly desired, because it is a typical task required for the
ﬁnal step of a production line.
Let us consider a task to put small cardboard boxes into
a large cardboard box. To do so, consider a peg-in-hole task
ﬁrst, since this packing task requires a similar strategy to that
of the peg-in-hole problem. In the peg-in-hole task, the peg
needs to move passively against the external force applied
to the peg, which is caused by the interaction between the
peg and the hole, to avoid jamming of the peg during the
insertion. Usually force control or compliant motion control
scheme, such as impedance control, stiffness control, etc., is
used for the peg-in-hole task. For successful execution of the
task, both the apparent dynamics of the motion of the peg for
the external force and the position of the compliance center
of the peg need to be selected appropriately. Going back to
our original problem, this means that appropriate selection of
both the apparent dynamics of the small cardboard box and
the position of the compliance center of the small cardboard
box are necessary for the box to be inserted to the larger box
without jamming.
Let us consider squeezing of a cardboard box next. Since
the small(er) cardboard box for packing (an) electronic
device(s) is not small and relatively large, manipulators
could handle it by squeezing it in a coordinated manner.
At this time, deformation of the box, which is caused
by the internal force applied to the cardboard box by the
manipulators, could not be negligible, because the squeeze
could cause vibratory motion of the manipulators and thus
the vibratory deformation of the box. In order to realize
vibration-free/stable manipulation of the deformable object,
we consider to specify dissipative apparent dynamics to the
relative motion of the manipulators against the internal force
appropriately.
With these two requirements mentioned above, the pro-
posed control algorithm is based on two coordinate systems;
one is a coordinate system describing the relative motion
of manipulators for the internal force applied to the object
and the other is a coordinate system describing the absolute
motion of the object against the external force applied to the
object. The motion of each manipulator is decoupled into
the absolute motion for the external force and the relative
motion for the internal force by deﬁning these coordinate
systems appropriately.
Similarly to some of the conventional control algorithms,
the proposed control algorithm controls the apparent dynam-
ics of the manipulated object, for external force applied to
the object from its environment. But in addition to the control
of the apparent dynamics of the object to the external force,
the proposed control algorithm controls the dynamics of
manipulators for the internal force applied to manipulators in
the coordinate system, which is different from the coordinate
system for the external force applied the object, to control
the dynamics of manipulators relating to the internal force
applied to the object. That is, to reduce/eliminate the vibra-
tory motion of the manipulators caused by the deformation
of the object, dissipative dynamics of manipulators for the
internal force applied to manipulators is speciﬁed.
In this way, the proposed algorithm could specify both
the apparent dynamics of the object against the external force
and the dissipative property of the object deformation against
the internal force, and the object is manipulated more stably
by the dual manipulators. Note that the dynamics of the
manipulated object are not required for the control algorithm.
III. COORDINATE SYSTEMS
First, let us consider a problem of handling an almost rigid
object with non-negligible deformation by dual manipulators
in coordination. We deﬁne coordinate systems as shown in

We assume that the orientation of the hand coordinate
systems and the object coordinate system are parallel that
of the absolute coordinate system when the object is held by
the dual manipulators.
A. Coordinate Systems for Force Control
When external force is applied to the object and the end-
effector of the manipulator grasping the object is controlled
by the force control, its motion depends on the deﬁnition of
the coordinate system used the force control, i.e., the position
and the orientation of the coordinate system used for the
control. For instance, in Fig. 2, let consider a case when the
object is pushed by the external force from the left hand side
of the object. Consider the case in which the origin of the
coordinate system for the force control is speciﬁed at the
center of the object and the case in which the origin of the
coordinate system for the force control is speciﬁed at the
bottom of the object.
When the coordinate system is located at the center of the
object, because the origin of the coordinate system for force
control is on the extended line of the external force vector,
the object moves along that line as shown in Fig. 2 (a). On
the other hand, as shown in Fig. 2 (b), when the coordinate
Peg
Hole Hole

system is located at the bottom of the object, moment around
the origin of the coordinate system is generated and causes
rotation around it, although the external force is applied to
the object in the same manner as the previous case. These
two ﬁgures show that the motion of the object depends on the
speciﬁcation of the coordinate system for the force control.
In this paper, a framework of force control system includ-
ing deﬁnition of the coordinate systems for force control is
based on the virtual mechanism [8]. According to the virtual
mechanism concept, the dynamics of the object or end-
effector, which executes a task, is represented by a mechan-
ical tool, such as a slider mechanism, a rolling mechanism,
a spring, etc. The motion of the object depending on the
force applied to the object corresponds to the displacement
of the mechanical tool. The axes of the displacement of the
mechanical tool correspond to the axes of the coordinate
system for the force control. In addition, the dynamics of the
object for the force applied to the object corresponds to the
dynamics of the mechanical tool. Fig. 3 shows an example
of the planar model of the virtual mechanism for the peg-in-
hole task.
We apply the virtual mechanism to both the apparent
dynamics of the object for the external force applied to
the object, that is, the absolute motion of the object, and
the dynamics for relative motion of the end-effectors, that
is, the deformation of the object. We deﬁne the coordinate
system with respect to the virtual mechanism to describe
the absolute motion of the object based on the force ap-
plied to the object in an external force coordinate system

simplify discussions, the external force coordinate system

the end-effector caused by the internal force is based on the
absolute motion of the object caused by the external force.
IV. COORDINATED MOTION CONTROL
A. Assumptions
To design the control algorithm for coordinated motion of
dual manipulators, the following assumptions are made.
 The relative motion between the end-effectors of dual
manipulators and the object being manipulated by dual
manipulators is negligible, i.e., dual manipulators hold
the object ﬁrmly.
 The deformation of the object is generated only by the
internal force, i.e., the relative position of both end-
effectors is unaffected by the external force applied to
the object.
 The position and orientation of the base coordinate
system of each manipulator with respect to the absolute
coordinate system are known, and the position and
orientation of the hand coordinate system of each end-
effector in the absolute coordinate system can be calcu-
lated based on forward kinematics of the manipulators.
 The external force coordinate system is identical to the
object coordinate system.
B. External Force
The apparent dynamics of the manipulated object for the
external force applied to the object has to be speciﬁed. To
calculate the external force applied to the object, the force
applied to each end-effector should be considered. Generally,
the force sensor is attached to the wrist of a manipulator
and we can measure the force applied to the end-effector.
Therefore, we assume that the force sensor is attached to the
wrist of a manipulator and the force applied to force sensor
can be measured.
The force applied to end-effector with respect to the
hand coordinate system can be calculated from the force
measured by the force sensor with respect to the sensor
coordinate system. Let

is its desired trajectory. By the apparent dynamics of the
manipulated object for the external force, we can prevent
excessive force applied to the object, which is caused by the
interaction between the object and its environment.
D. Internal Force
The equivalent force applied to the end-effector with
respect to the external force coordinate system is decoupled
as follows:

where,

F F F

and
ext
F F F

i
are the external component and
the internal component of the force applied by i-th end-
effector with respect to the external force coordinate system,
respectively. The external force applied to the object is
distributed to each manipulator according to the impedance
dynamics of each manipulator[6], and then, we deﬁne the
5148
external force distribution to each manipulator as the external
component of the force applied to the end-effector as follows:
ext
F F F
ext
i
= r

ext

where r

is the load distribution factor for i-th

the internal force coordinate system is designed based on
the external force coordinate system, the relative motion
of the end-effector is based on the motion of the object
with respect to the external force coordinate system. The
dynamics of the virtual mechanism for the internal force
is designed so that the relative motion of the end-effectors
is induced depending on the internal force. By designing
damping parameters of the dynamics properly, the object
can be handled by manipulators, without causing vibratory
motion, even without modeling the dynamics of the object,
assuming that the object dynamics is passive.

V. EXPERIMENT
The proposed control algorithm and the conventional con-
trol algorithm proposed in [6] were implemented in the the
experimental system, which consists of dual seven degree of
freedom manipulators as shown in Fig. 6. The force sensor
is attached to the wrist of each manipulator. The origin of
the absolute coordinate system is located at the intersection
between the table and the bisector of the line between the
origin of the hand coordinate systems. The spring scale,
whose stiffness coefﬁcient is 1307:6[N/m], was manipulated
by the dual manipulators in coordination. The direction of
the desired internal force is along x axis of the absolute
coordinate system. The internal force was applied to the
spring scale from 0[N] to 15[N] for 2[sec] calculated by
a ﬁfth order polynomial function of time. In continuation,
internal force 15[N] for 6[sec] was applied to the spring
scale. The impedance and damping parameters used for the
experiments are shown in Table I. In the conventional control,
the same impedance parameters of the apparent dynamics of
the object for the external force are used as the case of the
proposed control method. The experimental results of the
conventional control algorithm are shown in Fig. 5 and that
of the proposed control algorithm are shown in Fig. 7. The
measured position of the conventional control algorithm case
(Fig. 5(d)-(f)) is represented equivalent to the case of the
proposed control algorithm’s case. As shown in Fig. 5, the
vibratory force caused by the dynamics of the spring scale,
which is held by each end-effector, is seen in the case of

Fig. 7, the force applied to each end-effector is not vibratory

By using the proposed control algorithm, packing of small
cardboard boxes into a large cardboard box is realized.
Sequential images of the task are shown in Fig. 8. You can
see that the algorithm can be applied such a real industrial
task which is taken an example when control strategy is
discussed.
VI. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we have proposed a coordinated motion
control algorithm of dual manipulators for handling of an
almost rigid object with non-negligible deformation. The
virtual mechanism was used for specifying the coordinate
system for the force control. The motion of the manipulators
has been decoupled into to the absolute motion of the
object corresponding to the external force and the deformable
motion of the object corresponding to the internal force
by designing the internal force coordinate system and the
external force coordinate system appropriately.
Apparent dynamics of the manipulated object to the ex-
ternal force applied to the object from its environment is
controlled by the impedance controller, and the dynamics of
relative motion of the end-effectors for the internal force
applied to the end-effector is controlled by a dissipative
dynamics. By designing the parameters of the dissipative
dynamics appropriately, the vibratory motion of end-effector
caused by the dynamics of the manipulated object is sup-
pressed. Note that this control algorithm does not require the
dynamics of the manipulated object as long as the internal
dynamics of the object is passive.
Finally, we implemented the proposed control algorithm
and the conventional control algorithm to an experimental
dual manipulators system and carried our an experiment
of handling a spring scale. Using the proposed algorithm,
the vibratory motion observed with the conventional control
scheme was suppressed and the effectiveness was illustrated
for handling the object with non-negligible deformation by
dual manipulators in coordination.
