Abstract— This work considers a new application area for
autonomous soaring through the examination of the energetic
environment contained in supercell thunderstorms in an effort
to extend sampling mission duration. It identiﬁes the gust
front associated with the rear-ﬂank downdraft of the supercell
thunderstorm as an interesting candidate for such a mission,
and examines the potential for soaring in the region. This
knowledge is combined with sampling techniques employed
in previous ﬁeld experiments to produce an energy efﬁcient
path at an altitude and location identiﬁed as an interesting
area for in situ sampling. The path is tested using a ﬂight
through simulated storm data, and is shown to provide a net
positive gain in energy to the vehicle. This encouraging result
indicates the possibility of extending the sampling mission from
its current limited length to a signiﬁcant portion of the storm
evolution, a capability that could provide invaluable information
about the causes of tornadogenesis.
I. INTRODUCTION
The primary objective of the second Veriﬁcation of the
Origins of Rotation in Tornadoes Experiment (VORTEX2)
was to increase understanding of tornadogenesis - the process
of tornado formation [1]. A consensus of research in the last
25 years makes it clear that a small downdraft of a few kilo-
meters width, known as the rear-ﬂank downdraft (RFD) plays
a causative role in tornado formation [2]. Unfortunately,
access to the RFD for remote and in situ measurements is
difﬁcult using contemporary measurement techniques. While
weather radar can return detailed precipitation and wind-
ﬁeld data, it cannot return directly-measured thermodynamic
data. Balloons cannot be constrained to a sampling region
after release, and provide only serial ascents. Furthermore,
although ﬂows around the RFD have been sampled by
manned aircraft [3], manned assets for storm sensing are
hard to obtain, are relatively expensive, and risk human life.
During VORTEX2 a small unmanned aircraft system
(sUAS) was used to sample this this difﬁcult region of
the storm. Despite successfully intercepting six supercell
thunderstorms, two of which were tornadic, several areas for
improvement of the sUAS were identiﬁed. Among these was
increasing the endurance of the observations. Generally, the
sUAS was able to ﬂy missions lasting thirty minutes to an
hour depending on the wind environment [4]. Some of this
time was used for ingress and egress, and limited sampling
time such that only a few transects of the area of interest

could be performed. Although this still provided information
critical to understanding the thermodynamic properties of the
storm, the sampling window was too short to provide a good
understanding of the storm evolution.
Autonomous soaring has been shown in both simulation
and ﬂight tests to increase the endurance of sUAS. Recent
work has focused on the development of automatic control
algorithms for harvesting energy from relatively static fea-
tures such as thermals [5] or ridge lift [6]. These algorithms
exploit the structure of updrafts to keep the aircraft within an
area where it can gain energy, leaving the updraft to perform
any secondary tasks, or when the updraft’s potential has
dissipated. Other efforts have focused on utilizing wind-ﬁeld
gradients to add energy to the aircraft [7], [8], [9]. That work
generally considers short ﬂight paths designed to beneﬁt from
structure of the wind ﬁeld, and links the ﬂight paths in a
manner which achieves a set of sensing goals. Limited work
has also focused on energy extraction from gusts [10]. This
requires a reactive technique to make use of the short term
effects of turbulence to impart small amounts of energy to
the vehicle.
Effective use of static and dynamic soaring require knowl-
edge about the local wind environment. Given that sUAS
are typically operated in clear air environments where mea-
surements of the global wind ﬁeld are not available, the
information must be gathered during the mission or provided
a priori to the controller. A priori knowledge of the wind
ﬁeld given is usually limited to the region around geographic
features such as mountain ridges, ocean waves, and other
surface features as they produce known gradient ﬁelds that
can generate sufﬁcient lift or shear to sustain ﬂight. This
paper presents a proposal to exploit the unique environment
of supercell thunderstorms, where ﬁne-scale dual-Doppler
RADAR measurements are commonly available (even if not
in real-time), and the structure of the storm is relatively well
known on a large scale [3]. A synthesis of these two infor-
mation sources provides signiﬁcant knowledge of the wind
environment, and can be leveraged for path planning. An
example of this has been demonstrated through simulation to
provide feasible paths through the storm environment [11].
II. ENERGY HARVESTING
Static soaring makes use of vertical winds to impart energy
to an aircraft. These winds can be generated in a variety of
ways, but are typically due to convection or the interaction
of surface winds with terrain. The convection-generated lift
occurs over regions where the surface is warmer than the
surrounding area. This produces a column of rising air,

Fig. 1. a) Static soaring, b) dynamic soaring, c) gust energy extraction
known as a thermal, which can impart sufﬁcient energy to
sustain gliding ﬂight by manned aircraft. Terrain features
can also create regions of rising air, particularly around
ridges and mountains. Orographic lift, or ridge lift, is caused
when horizontal winds are pushed over a rise in the terrain.
Larger features, such as mountains, can also produce lift
downstream of their interaction with the wind in the form of
lee waves which can reach heights several times that of the
obstacle.
Dynamic soaring exploits gradients in a wind ﬁeld to
impart energy to an airborne body. As this process was
ﬁrst described in relation to the energy efﬁcient ﬂights of
birds over the ocean [12], a signiﬁcant body of work has
been performed to describe ﬂight over large bodies of water.
This includes the fundamental work performed by Lissaman
[8]and Sachs [7] to use dynamic equations to describe the
energy extraction methods, and comment on the minimum
shear required to sustain ﬂight. It has been further extended
through the work of Richardson [9] who parameterized the
various aspects of the required ﬂight path, and considered
additional energy extraction through boundary layer pro-
cesses in the presence of ocean waves. Other studies have
also examined ridge soaring [13], [14], [15], utilizing natural
gradients from a terrestrial boundary layer [16], and even
generic wind structures [17].
Figure 1 graphically depicts dynamic and static soaring,
as well as energy extraction from gusts. Although energy
from gusts might be viable for a sUAS, particularly in the
turbulent storm environment, the remainder of this work
will focus on static and dynamic soaring. Considering the
state of the art for both radar systems and storm simu-
lations, ﬁne scale turbulence will be difﬁcult to resolve,
effectively providing an unknown environment similar to
studies that have already been conducted [10]. Furthermore,
given supercell thunderstorms are deﬁned by large regions
of strong convection, energy extraction using static soaring
is a much more likely candidate for certain locations within
the storm. Dynamic soaring is similarly attractive given the
large gradients present in the boundaries between the various
inﬂows and outﬂows.
To examine the utility of static soring in the supercell
environment, the work of Depenbusch [18] is used to deﬁne
the change in total energy state for gliding through a given
region of the storm. Given an aircraft with wing areaS ﬂying

Evaluation of dynamic soaring for use in energy harvesting
requires a different approach. While it is possible for energy
gain from static soaring to be realized at each instance during
a ﬂight, the nature of dynamic soaring requires that a ﬂight
path is deﬁned and the energy evaluated over the path length
to determine a net energy gain. This energy gain is evaluated
using equations presented by Gao [16]. The rate of change

model [19]. The simulation has been designed to utilize data
sets generated from simulations of tornadic supercell thun-
derstorms produced by the Straka Atmospheric Model[20].
The storm parameters for the data set used here are given
on a 48048010 grid with 150 m horizontal spacing and a
stretched vertical grid spacing containing 10 altitudes from
750 m to 1694 m above ground level (AGL). Simulated
measurements include rain, hail, and three-dimensional wind
velocity components relative to the storm frame of reference,
provided every ﬁve minutes for 20 minutes. The storm sim-
ulation is aligned such that the positive y-axis corresponds
to north, and the storm is moving at 19 m/s to the east and
2 m/s to the north. Rain contours and wind components for
this data set are shown in Figure 2(a).
Equation 1 is applied to the simulated supercell data to
identify potential regions for static soaring. The aircraft
parameters for Equation 1 are derived from the Tempest
sUAS used in the VORTEX2 ﬁeld campaign (Table I or [21]),
or are approximated from similar aircraft. The results can be
seen in Figure 2(b). To create this energy map, the UA is
assumed to be performing horizontal transects of the storm
at 300 m, and is set to zero. Also,w
x
is assumed to be the
magnitude of the wind interpolated from the wind velocities
provided at each grid location. This accounts for the worst
case scenario where the UA is ﬂying directly into the wind.
A quick glance at the energy map reveals that even with these

pessimistic assumptions, several areas of the storm support a
positive change in energy and therefore possess the potential
for sustained ﬂight.
Upon closer examination, however, the regions with the
strongest updrafts are not in ideal locations for a sampling
mission. As can be seen at the top of the rear-ﬂank gust front
(RFGF) in Figure 2(a), the reason for the strong updraft in
the region is its proximity to the location of the tornado,
indicated by the convergence of the cyclonic winds in this
region. The other potential location for static soaring, located
at the coordinates(2:4510

;1:9510

), appears promising,
but upon examination of a time series of the data, turns
out to be a very short-lived feature. Therefore, although the
available data limits the examination to a 20 minute segment
of the storm’s evolution, static soaring appears to be a poor
choice for energy harvesting.
As an alternative, dynamic soaring is considered. Although
complete circuits are required to provide an analysis of the
energy that can be extracted using this method at a given
point on the map, Lissaman’s work indicates that a minimum
linear shear gradient, S, for energy-neutral cycles is given
by S = 4:75=G where G is the maximum L/D [8]. In the
case of the Tempest this is approximately 0:12. Figure 3(a)
shows the shear gradient at the chosen sampling altitude of
200 m. Unfortunately, similar to static soaring the areas that
would best support soaring are either located too close to
the location of the tornado, or are in short lived features.
However, a region of shear does exist around the RFGF,
and while not large enough in magnitude to sustain energy
neutral ﬂight, will add to the total sUAS energy making use
of dynamic soaring.
IV. SIMULATION
To continue the examination of the potential for dynamic
soaring techniques to extend mission duration, several ﬂights
were conducted through the simulated storm data. The con-
cept of operations was based on a derivation of the UAS
scientiﬁc objectives deﬁned by the VORTEX2 project. This
assumes the RFD of a supercell thunderstorm as the feature
of interest, and identiﬁes sampling patterns, sampling alti-
tudes and desired sampling times. The 2010 ﬁeld component
of the VORTEX2 work identiﬁed and utilized three sampling
techniques designed to ﬁt the requirements of the regulatory
and vehicle constraints imposed on the project [4]. For one
of these techniques, the UA ﬂies east-west transects out to 5

of the aircraft.
km either side of the RFGF up to 300 m AGL, starting from
a launch point ahead of the storm (Figure 4). This provides
the best opportunity for performing multiple transects before
the storm moves out of range.
Combining the scientiﬁc goals with the analysis from the
previous section, a sampling pattern was chosen that consists
of an orbit centered on the RFGF, approximately 5 km south
of the hook echo (Figure 3(a)). The altitude of the orbit
descends linearly from west to east to produce a pattern
able to take advantage of the environment’s wind gradient
in combination with the updraft present behind the gust
front (Figure 3(b)). This altitude change is set at 100 meters
on either side of the intended 200 meter sampling altitude.
While this height change is larger than typical dynamic
soaring altitude deviation, it allows for the vehicle to both
remain closer to the ground at the lowest part of the orbit,
while pushing higher toward the stronger updrafts on the
opposing side. For control of the aircraft the desired height,

during the VORTEX2 operations. The radius of the orbit,
and thus the transect distance has been reduced from the
typical 5km to 1km, so the UA performs more orbits during

the 20 minutes of simulated storm data. This might affect the
quality of the sampled data, but must also be balanced with
the required radius for effective dynamic soaring, which is
typically much smaller than 1km. An investigation as to the
feasibility and value of changing the orbit radius is left to
future work.
In order to track the RFGF and the sampling location 5 km
south of the hook echo for the full 20 minutes of simulated
storm data, it was necessary to move the center of the orbit
pattern. This was done through linear interpolation of the
desired location for sensing at the start of the simulation and
end of the simulation. This movement of the orbit center
along with stronger west to east winds produced the spiraling
motion of the aircraft ﬂight path, shown in Figure 5. Note
that the axes scales remain constant as the axis labels change
according to the translation of the storm in the inertial frame.
Given the limited timespan of the data, and the ability to
easily identify features such as the RFGF and hook echo,
the tracking of the desired center location of the orbit was
a relatively simple task to perform manually. However, in
real-world situations this might not be so easy, especially
considering the wind environment will not be as well known
as it is in the simulation. The location of the center of the
orbit will not only need to move according to the progression
of the gust front, as demonstrated by this simulated storm, but
the translation of the hook echo must also considered for the
aircraft to avoid dangerous regions of the supercell. As was
done here, human determination of the location of the hook
echo is possible through examination of reﬂectivity data, that
might be sent to the aircraft. However, the winds in the RFGF
will not be well deﬁned and an automatic algorithm will
probably be needed to keep the orbit center in the optimal
location for harvesting energy.
Figure 5 shows the results from one simulated run. The UA
was initialized on the orbit path and utilized a PID controller
to maintain a radius from the orbit center and the correct
altitude. The color of the track is used to indicate the amount
of energy at intervals during the simulation found using:

However, well beyond simply adding some energy to the
system, the net result is a signiﬁcant increase (Figure 7).
Further examining the storm structure reveals why this is
the case. Unlike typical dynamic soaring applications, that
simply require that the strength of the horizontal winds
increase with altitude, the gust front contains additional
features that enhance the energy extraction process. Figure
3(b) shows two of these features. First, the lower level winds
are part of the inﬂow and arriving from the east, in the
opposite direction of the higher level winds encountered
in the ﬂight path on the west side of the RFGF. Second,
the winds on the west side of the RFGF have a signiﬁcant
positivez component. This increases the amount of energy in
the system in a similar fashion to the static soaring approach,
and can be seen in Figure 2(b).
V. CONCLUSIONS
The ability to extract energy from supercell thunderstorms
was examined, with speciﬁc regard to static and dynamic
soaring. Regions of the storm were determined to have
updrafts signiﬁcant enough to sustain ﬂight, but poor choices
due to their proximity to the hook echo, and relatively small
geometry in the horizontal plane. An examination was also
performed to determine if a sUAS could employ dynamic
soaring techniques to simultaneously sample and gain energy.
Simulated ﬂights indicate the promising result that energy
can be harvested in this manner, however they also indicate
a need for the determination of the optimal orbit to improve
the amount of energy obtained from each orbit. Future work
will also include an analysis of the effect of the radius of the
orbit and changes in altitude across the orbit on the ability
to extract energy. Given that the distance to the hook echo is
approximately 5 km, increasing the radius too much in they
direction will put the aircraft in dangerous parts of the storm
to perform its sampling mission. The pattern geometry might
need to be modiﬁed to limit the deviation of the aircraft from
the x axis of the orbit.
