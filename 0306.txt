Real-Time Distributed Optimal Trajectory Generation for
Nonholonomic Vehicles in Formations
Reze Haghighi, Danwei Wang and Changboon Low
AbstractÑ This paper addresses the distributed formation
trajectory planning for a group of nonholonomic vehicles. This
is realized with a decentralized Model Predictive Control under
dynamic virtual structure architecture. A speciÞc limitation of
virtual structure based formation method is the necessity of
access to the desired reference. To remove this requirement,
a distributed estimator is developed so that each vehicle can
construct the desired reference based on the local information
exchange. In formation trajectory planning, several issues
are taken into consideration which includes: (i) distributed
formation achievement by a team of nonholonomic vehicles
from initial situation. (ii) inter-group collision avoidance. (iii)
dynamic formation to obtain ßexible manoeuvring during
movement in unknown and cluttered environment. (iv) obstacle
avoidance. Finally, simulation results are presented to illustrate
the performance of the proposed methodology in producing op-
timal formation trajectory planning for multiple nonholonomic
vehicles.
I. INTRODUCTION
The past few decades have witnessed increasing interest
in coordination and control of multi-vehicle systems in the
robotic and control communities [1]. The attention to multi-
vehicle systems has been promoted by advances in communi-
cation technologies. Multi-vehicle systems have been utilized
in search and rescue, surveillance, cooperative transportation
and so on. In majority of these applications, vehicles are
required to form a desired formation during movement
[2],[3]. In formation control of multiple vehicle systems
various scenarios are usually involved such as: (i) vehicles
should maintain a desired geometric formation of varied
shapes. (ii) Physical constraints imposed by the vehicles
(such as mobility constraints or nonholonomic constraints),
must be satisÞed. (iii) Formations should be ßexible to
accommodate the environment constraints, such as presence
of obstacles and moving objects. (iv) Limitations in sensing
and communication ranges must be taken into account.
Trajectory planning is a fundamental problem for robotic
applications [4]. Trajectory Planning can be described as
generating a feasible trajectory and its corresponding control
to guide a robotic system from an initial state to a Þnal state
without violating any given constraints on the system and its
environment. For nonholonomic vehicles, due to kinematic
constraints a collision-free path in the conÞguration space
is not necessarily feasible. Primary works on trajectory
generation for nonholonomic systems was done in [5],[6],
where steering control was designed based on sinusoidal,
polynomial, or piecewise constant functions. Afterwards var-
ious methods have been proposed on trajectory planning of
nonholonomic vehicles [7]-[9].
Consensus control is one of the important problems in
networks of multi-vehicle systems that has gained increasing
attention, owing to its wide potential applications [10].
Recently, there has been considerable study on improving
formation control techniques to make it more distributed. As
a result, distributed leader-follower approach has been pro-
posed which rely on information exchange between neigh-
boring agents [11]. Su et al. [12] extended the multi-agent
ßocking algorithm proposed by Olfati-Saber [13] to the case
that only a fraction of agents are informed of the virtual
leader with time-varying velocity. Choi et al. [14] addressed
a leader-follower formation control in the absence of leaderÕs
velocity information. Dong [15] discussed the formation
control of multiple mobile agents under the condition that
the desired trajectory is available to only portion of agents.
In [16] the distributed shape formation control was proposed
for multi-agent systems.
Model Predictive Control (MPC) or Receding Horizon Con-
trol (RHC) has gained more and more attention in the
control community [17]. Model Predictive Control (MPC)
has addressed issues of trajectory tracking, point stabiliza-
tion and formation control of nonholonomic mobile robots.
The increase in popularity of MPC is due to its abilities
of constraint handling, real-time prediction and optimizing.
Main idea of MPC is to compute the control action by
minimizing a Þnite horizon optimization problem. MPC has
been frequently used in trajectory planning. Kim et al. [18]
considered nonlinear MPC for path planning of autonomous
helicopters. Falcone et al. [19] presented a MPC approach for
controlling an active front steering system in an autonomous
vehicle. Yoon et al. [20] addressed trajectory generation for
unmanned ground vehicles based on nonlinear MPC.
This paper presents the real-time distributed trajectory gen-
eration for multiple nonholonomic vehicles based on the
virtual structure architecture. Since in the virtual structure
architecture, vehicles are required to have knowledge of
the desired reference, a distributed estimator is proposed
to construct the desired reference for each vehicle based
on local information exchange by its neighboring vehicles.
Consequently, a decentralized Model Predictive Control is
utilized to obtain formation control for various objectives
such as inter-collision avoidance and obstacle avoidance.

III. FORMATION TRAJECTORY PLANNING
In formation trajectory planning for a group of nonholo-
nomic vehicles, several issues need to be taken into consid-
eration such as decentralized trajectory planning, nonholo-
nomic constraints, formation maintenance, formation defor-
mation, inter-vehicle collision avoidance, obstacle avoidance.
A key solution to formation trajectory planning is to obtain
a dynamic formation control approach which is adaptable to
the changes of the environment. One way of approaching
formation control problem is through the use of the concept
of the virtual structures. In the virtual structure based forma-
tion control method the entire desired formation is treated as
a single entity speciÞed by a reference frame. The formation
as a whole should follow a predeÞned trajectory, i.e. the
reference frame should follow the desired trajectory and each
vehicle should follow a speciÞed and possibly time-varying
location relative to the reference frame. An illustration of
the virtual structure based formation for a group of three
vehicles is depicted in Þgure 1, such that O represents the
reference of the virtual structure, d
i
2 R
2
is the offset from
the reference and q
d
(t)2 R
3
is the desired trajectory.
IV. VIRTUAL STRUCTURE BASED FORMATION
In the virtual structure architecture, the speciÞed structure
is deÞned based on a reference which follows the desired
trajectory. Vehicles require to have knowledge about the
desired trajectory. The desired trajectory can be preplanned
which reduces the ßexibility of the group in moving in an
unknown environments. The other solution is introducing a
virtual leader, which in this case the state of the virtual leader
have to broadcast to all members of the group. However,
limitation in communication range is a problem in global
information broadcasting. To deal with these problems, an
estimator is introduced so that each vehicle estimates the
state of the virtual leader based on the local information
exchange. In the following, the distributed algorithm for
estimation of the desired trajectory of the virtual structure
is presented.
Consider that communication topology among agents is rep-
resented by a directed graphG with the associate laplacian
matrixL=[l

i can obtain information from the agent j, a

reference is expressed as follows:

reference tracking error is going to zero.
To obtain the virtual structure based formation, the Model
Predictive Control (MPC) is applied. In the following, the
formulation of decentralized MPC for virtual structure based
formation trajectory planning is presented.
V. MPC FORMULATION FOR FORMATION TRAJECTORY
PLANNING
In Model Predictive Control the current control action is
obtained for a system by solving, at each sampling time, a
Þnite horizon optimization problem using the current state of
the system as the initial state. Then the optimization yields an
optimal input sequence and the Þrst element of the optimal
input sequence is applied to the plant. An illustration of
the decentralized MPC-based formation trajectory planning
is depicted in Þgure 2.
In the proposed formulation of MPC for formation trajectory
planning, each vehicle formulates an optimization problem
over a Þnite time horizon. In the optimization formulation,
each vehicle takes its current position, q
i
=
£
x
i

,
and the last known positions of neighboring vehicle within
its detection region, q
j
=

T
, as initial condi-
tion. During the optimization process each vehicle optimizes
independently its predicted trajectory to follow as close as
possible the set of N samples of its future desired trajectory.
In the following, the cost function utilized for MPC is
presented.
A. Cost function formulation
Given the current state of vehicle i, i.e. q
i
(k), MPC is to
compute the optimal input sequence which minimizes the
following cost function:

such that P, Q and R are constant weighting matrices. To
obtain the desired performance, the cost function (11) is
solved subject to the following constraints:
1) Kinematic model equality constraints: Each vehicle
must satisfy the discrete kinematic model presented in (1).
This requirement is incorporated into the Þnite time horizon
optimization problem as equality constraint as follows:
f(q
i
(k);u
i
(k))Á q
i
(k+ 1)= 0 (14)
2) Input constraints: For nonholonomic vehicles, input
constraints are the bounded values for linear and angular
velocities which are formulated as the following inequality:

is
the bounded value for l

3) Inter-vehicle collision avoidance: To achieve collision
avoidance, the following potential-like cost function is con-
sidered using the information from neighboring vehicles:

is the distance between vehicle i and its neigh-
bouring vehicle j, max is the maximum function, r
c
is the
safe inter-vehicle distance, and e is a small positive constant
for non-singularity.

4) Obstacle avoidance: To achieve obstacle avoidance,
the following potential-like cost function is considered:

yields a local minima for vehicle 1. Unlike many approaches
that cannot handle this situation, the proposed method results
in an acceptable performance. The desired trajectory was
considered as follows:

To consider various scenarios, obstacles are positioned in
different geometrical patterns. It should be noted that even
though some planned trajectories intersect in space (for
example trajectories of vehicle 1 and 2 in Þgure 6), they
do not intersect in time. To clarify this issue for the case 2
(i.e. Þgure 6) trajectories of vehicles are depicted in Þgure
9 in 3 dimension versus time.
VII. CONCLUSION
In this paper, the distributed formation trajectory planning
for a group of nonholonomic vehicles has been presented.

A decentralized Model Predictive Control has been utilized
for trajectory generation. The desired formation has been
obtained using the virtual structure architecture. A distributed
estimator has been proposed to deal with the limitation
of virtual structure based formation method which is the
necessity of access to the desired reference. Simulation
results have been presented to illustrate the performance of
the proposed methodology in producing optimal formation
trajectory planning for multiple nonholonomic vehicles in
static/moving obstacle based environments.
APPENDIX
Lemma A1: [22] Consider a digraph G with the corre-
sponding laplacian matrixL, which has a directed spanning
tree; and a diagonal matrix B with nonnegative diagonal
entries. The matrixL+B is nonsingular, if and only if, at
least one of the diagonal entries ofB is positive.
Lemma A2: [23] Let W = IÁ eA, such that e <
1
max

.
If l is an eigenvalue of A, then 1Á el is an eigenvalue of
W. Consequently, if A has positive eigenvalues then all the
eigenvalues of W lie in the interior of the unit circle.
