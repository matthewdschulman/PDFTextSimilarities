Abstract — This paper presents the idea of employing 
constraints to expand the workspace of Underactuated Flexible 
Manipulators (UFM). The constraints are divided into two types: 
bilateral constraint (BC) and unilateral constraint (UC). Under 
the constraints the UFM is segmented into two sections: the 
anterior constrained section and the distal free section; 
moreover, the motion of the UFM is altered, i.e., the end effector 
of the UFM can get access to positions where unreachable 
previously, or, the workspace is expanded. In the paper, 
constrained kinematics model is developed at first. The 
workspace is derived thereafter. To validate the idea, an 
underactuated wire-driven serpentine manipulator is built. In 
the experiments, the two types of constraints are applied. 
Experiment results agree well with the simulation results.  
I.  INTRODUCTION 
OBOT arm is widely used. From the structure point of 
view, it could be divided into three categories, i.e. 
discrete robotic arm, serpentine robotic arm and continuum 
robotic arm [1]. A discrete robotic arm has a few rigid links, 
such as SCARA and PUMA robot. This type of manipulator 
has limited Degree of Freedoms (DOFs) and is usually 
operated in open space. A serpentine robotic arm has a series 
of chained links [2-4]. The DOF number is increased a lot. A 
continuum robotic arm has several compliant segments with a 
few joints [5] or no joint at all [6]. Theoretically, the DOF 
number is infinite. Serpentine robotic arms and continuum 
robotic arms are both flexible and are categorized as flexible 
manipulator.  
To fully control the flexible manipulator, a large number of 
actuators are needed. This makes the manipulator structure as 
well as the control very complicated. Underactuation [7, 8] 
could simplify the robot system a lot. In the underactuated 
system, the actuator number is less than the number of DOFs. 
As a consequence, workspace of the manipulator is reduced. 
Typical underactuated flexible manipulators (UFM) are 
Wire/Tendon/Cable driven serpentine robotic arms and 
continuum robotic arms [2, 5, 9]. End effector of the UFM is 
positioned and orientated by bending the backbone actively. 
During the bending, the joints rotations are related. 
Due to the flexibility, UFMs are well suited in confined 
space. Typical applications are Minimally Invasive Surgery 
(MIS), engineering non-destructive inspection, disaster relief 
etc.[10]. The “Snake Arm” of OC Robotics [11], is a typical 
UFM used for engineering inspection. During the inspection, 
 
Zheng Li and Ruxu Du are with the Institute of Precision Engineering and 
the Dept. of Mechanical and Automation Engineering, the Chinese 
University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR (phone: 852-31634237; email: 
zli@mae.cuhk.edu.hk, rdu@mae.cuhk.edu.hk). 
the flexible manipulator is inserted into the target area, such 
as the engine cavity. The position and orientation of the end 
effector is controlled by tendons. Images inside the engine are 
transmitted to the monitor. However, not every region inside 
the cavity can be viewed due to the limited workspace. 
Conventionally, obstacles are avoided in the operation. This 
would further reduce the workspace of the robot. To avoid the 
obstacles and plan the robot motion in confined space, 
researchers have already worked out a lot of approaches. Such 
as in [3] and [12] motion planning methods are proposed for 
flexible manipulators.  
Indeed, obstacles hinder the robot movement. Though, we 
can also take advantage of them. In nature, there are a lot of 
underactuated flexible examples, such as snake, octopus arm, 
human fingers, and etc. How do they employ the obstacles? 
Take the human index finger as an example. Similar to UFMs, 
the motion of the finger is flexing. Without external forces, 
the index finger cannot flex the distal inter-phalangeal joint 
only, at least for the author. This shows the index finger can 
employ the external constraint bending to different shapes. 
For a UFM, new shapes mean additional end effector position 
and orientation. In the inspection, it is always beneficial that 
the instrument can reach more positions or reach the same 
position with more orientation options. In this paper, the 
novel idea of employing obstacles to expand UFM workspace 
is presented. Examples are given by the underactuated 
wire-driven serpentine robotic arm with one bending DOF.  
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: in section 2 
the design as well as the kinematics model of UFMs are 
reviewed; in section 3 constrained kinematics model for 
UFMs is derived; in section 4 the workspace of UFMs with 
two types of constraints are developed; in section 5 the 
wire-driven robotic arm as well as experiment results are 
presented; finally, conclusions are given in section 6. 
II. UNDERACTUATED FLEXIBLE MANIPULATOR 
There are two types of UFMs. One is the underactuated 
continuum manipulator (UCM), such as the “Elephant Trunk 
Robot” [13]. The other is the underactuated serpentine 
manipulator (USM), such as the “Snake Arm”[11]. The 
actuation of UFM can be various, such as Pneumatic 
Artificial Muscle (PAM) [13], Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) 
[14], Electro Active Polymer (EAP) [15], wire / tendon / cable 
[9, 16], etc. Figure 1 shows the backbone deformation of the 
two types of UFMs.

Fig.1 Two types of UFMs 
For UFMs, to reach a target position their backbones are 
deformed to a specific configuration by the actuators. The 
kinematics can be divided into two parts: from the actuation 
space to the configuration space and from the configuration 
space to the task space [1]. In the first part, the kinematics 
model varies with actuation methods. The second part is 
purely geometry problem.  
In this section, the kinematics model of the second part is 
reviewed for single segment planar UCM and USM. It is 
simple but fundamental. As the backbone of UFMs is usually 
bend to a circular arc, in the analysis, the piecewise constant 
curvature assumption is used. Figure 1(a) shows the UCM 
motion. In the figure, the blue dashed line represents the 
manipulator at resting position. The red curve is the deformed 
backbone. From the constant curvature assumption, the 
position of the end effector is as Equation (1). Here L is the 
length of the flexible backbone, ?? is the backbone bending 
angle, and =/ RL?? is the curve radius.

Figure 1(b) shows the USM motion. The blue dashed line is 
the USM at resting position. The red polyline is the deformed 
USM. It is assumed that there are N links, and the length of 
each link is l. When the end effector orientation is controlled 
as ?? , the end effector position is as per Equation (2).

In the equation ? is the joint rotation.  Similarly, from the 
constant curvature assumption, the rotation of each joint is 
identical, i.e.  =N ? ?? ? .  
UCM could be viewed as a special case of USM when N 
goes to infinity. The end effector position with respect to 
bending angle is as shown in Equation (3). From Equation (3), 
the end effector rotation can be solved as per Equation (4). 
Equation (3) and Equation (4) are the generalized forward 
kinematics model and inverse kinematics model for single 
segment planar UFM. When the UFM structure parameters, 
i.e. L, N, are known, the UFM end effector position could be 
determined from the orientation, and vice versa.

Workspace is the set of all reachable positions. For single

effector. It is obtained from the forward kinematics model.

min
? and  
max

determined by the UFM structure. From Equation (5), it is 
seen that the trajectory of a single segment UFM is quadratic.  
III. KINEMATICS UNDER CONSTRAINT 
In the confined space, there are two types of obstacles. One 
is the bilateral constraint (BC), and the other is the unilateral 
constraint (UC). Figure 2 shows the UFM bending motion in 
three cases: i) free bending; ii) bend under BC; iii) bend under 
UC. When the UFM is constrained, it is segmented into the 
anterior constrained section and the distal free section. The 
BC confines the free section two-sided, while the UC 
confines the free section one-sided.  
 
Fig. 2 Three Types of UFM Motion 
In practice, there are several ways to find the constraint 
position, such as stereo vision [17], magnetic sensor [18], etc. 
Bajo and Simman also proposed a method to locate the 
contact for continuum robots [19]. Therefore, we assume that 
the constraint position ( , )
cc
xy in the robot base coordinate 
frame is known. The kinematics under constraint can be 
obtained by three steps: first, find the constrained joint 
position and the constrained link orientation; second, perform 
unconstrained kinematics for the free section w.r.t. the 
constrained joint; third, obtain the end effector position and 
orientation by integrating the first two parts.

Figure 3 shows the UFM under constraint. In the figure, B

The constrained joint P

section. The free section is viewed as a new manipulator. The 
kinematics model is the same as the previous unconstrained 
kinematics, with the backbone length L L L ?? ? ?? and joint 
number N N N ?? ? ?? . 
B. Constraint Inverse Kinematics 
The inverse kinematics is to answer the question how to 
reach a position with given orientation. In the constraint 
inverse kinematics, the problem becomes how to deploy 
constraints/obstacles to enable the UFM reaching the position 
with given orientation. 
Assume the targeted end effector position is (x, y), and the 
desired rotation is?? . From Figure 3, it is seen that as long as 
the constraint lies along link P
N’-1
P
N’
, the position of P
N’
 is the

the joint, i.e. C is coincident with P

(12) 
In Equation (12), there are four unknowns? ? , , , NN?? ? ?? ? ?? 
and four independent equations. Mathematically, solutions 
exist. However, due to the UFM structure constraint, the joint 
rotation is bounded. As a result, only the solution that has 
valid joint rotation is admissible. To find the admissible 
solution, we can let N’ varying from 1 to N-1 and find all the 
orientations. On the contrary, when orientation is of more 
importance, we can also find the N-1 possible end effector 
positions. It is not for sure that we can meet the position and 
orientation requirements simultaneously. As a compromise, 
we can meet one first and make the other as close as possible.  
Figure 4 gives an example. In this example, N=10, l=15 and 
max
=142.5º. In the figures, the red dashed curve is the end 
effector trajectory without constraint. The left and right green 
poly lines are the manipulator at two bending limits. The 
circles denote the joints and the solid square is the constrained 
joint. Yellow represents effective solution, and cyan means in 
the solution the joint rotation violates the limit. The desired 
position is X=66.1mm, Y=120.7mm and the orientation is 
=1.32rad. In Figure 4 (a), bilateral constraint is deployed at 
joint 1 to joint 9 successively. In all the cases, the end effector 
gets to the desired position. The enlarged view shows the end 
effector orientation. In this example, admissible solution 
exists when the sixth joint is constrained as shown by the red 
line. For the fixed joints, the rotation is 0.03 rad; the rotations 
of other joints are 0.12 rad. Together with the admissible 
solution, there are 6 orientations for the end effector to reach 
the target position. The cases in cyan denote the solution 
violates the joint limit. Figure 4 (b) shows the solutions with 
desired end effector orientation and X position. From the 
simulation results, there are totally five configurations to 
meet the requirement. Figure 4 (c) shows the solutions with 
2903
 
 
 
exact orientation and Y position. From the simulation results, 
besides the admissible solution, there are three configurations 
to meet the requirement. It should be noted that, admissible 
solution does not always exist. With increased number of 
links, it is more likely to have admissible solution. When N is 
infinity (i.e. UCM), admissible solution always exists.

IV. WORKSPACE UNDER CONSTRAINT 
Workspace of the UFM is obtained from the forward 
kinematics. It is the collection of all possible positions which 
the end effector can reach. The BC and UC limit the joint 
rotation differently. Their workspaces are hence different.   
A. Workspace with Bilateral Constraint 
When the UFM is fixed in the middle, the constrained 
section is fixed. The free section turns to a new UFM, taking 
the constrained joint as the base. The end effector position 
and orientation can be determined as in the previous section. 
For the free section, the maximum joint rotation remains the 
same. The end effector trajectory is shown by Equation (13). 
In the equation, 
min
? and 
max
? are the minimum and maximum 
joint rotation.

The constraint position is controllable. As a result the UFM 
workspace with BC is the collection of all the possible 
trajectories. Figure 5 shows the workspace of a UFM with 
single BC. It is obvious that, compared to the workspace 
without constraints (dashed curve), the workspace with single 
BC is greatly expanded (shaded region). 
 
Fig. 5 Workspace with Single Bilateral Constraint 
B. Workspace with Unilateral Constraint 
When there is a UC, the UFM cannot cross over the 
constraint but can retrieve freely. The free section motion is 
partitioned into forward bending and backward bending. The 
forward bending is the same as that with BC and the 
backward bending is the same as that without constraint. 
Assume the UC locates in the right plane, i.e. 0

possible trajectories.  
Figure 6 shows the workspace of the UFM with a single 
UC. In this case the workspace is also expanded a lot. It is 
noted that, the workspace under UC is bounded by the free 
2904
 
 
 
bending trajectory. It is a subspace of the workspace with BC. 
 
Fig. 6 Workspace with Single Unilateral Constraint 
When the UFM is confined by multiple constraints or 
hybrid constraints the forward kinematics, inverse kinematics 
and workspace can be solved in a similar way.  
V. EXPERIMENTS AND DISCUSSIONS 
A wire-driven underactuated serpentine manipulator is 
built to test the proposed idea. The prototype has 10 identical 
vertebras (or link). The length of each link is 15 mm, and the 
maximum joint rotation is 14.25º. Specifics of the UFM are 
shown in [9]. In the experiments, trajectory of the end effector 
is recorded using a grid paper as shown in Figure 7. 
 
Fig. 7 Wire-Driven Underactuated Serpentine Manipulator 
Two experiments are carried out. In the first experiment, 
the trajectory of the end effector under one BC is recorded 
and compared with that of model prediction. In the second 
experiment, the end effector trajectory under multiple UCs is 
compared with simulated trajectory. 
A. End Effector Trajectory with Bilateral Constraint 
In this experiment, the trajectory with one BC is measured 
and compared with model prediction. In the experiment the 
BC is applied by pinning a needle to the joint rotate center.  
Figure 8 shows the results. In the figure, the curves are the 
predicted end effector trajectory; the diamonds are the 
recorded positions along the path; the squares are the BCs; the 
circles are the joints; and the polylines are the bending limits 
of the USM in different cases. Five cases are shown. In the 
first case, the USM bends freely. In case 2, the USM is pinned 
at the fifth joint when it is at the resting position. In case 3, the 
USM is pinned at the third joint when it is at the resting 
position. In case 4, the USM is pinned at the fifth joint when it 
is at the left bending limit. In case 5, the USM is pinned at the 
third joint when it is at the right bending limit. From the figure, 
the model well predicts the end effector trajectory with one 
BC in all the cases. When the USM is pinned at the resting 
position, the altered trajectory is bounded by the free bending 
trajectory. When the USM is pinned at the bended position, 
the altered trajectory crosses the free bending trajectory. 
Although the trajectory with single BC is shortened compared 
to the free bending trajectory, by actively controlling the BC 
position, the workspace of the USM can be expanded a lot.  
 
Fig. 8 End Effector Trajectory with single BC  
B. End Effector Trajectory with Unilateral Constraint 
In this experiment the method of predicting the end effector 
trajectory with multiple UCs is tested. Results are as shown in 
Figure 9. UCs are randomly placed on the bending plane as 
shown by the squares. In the beginning, the UFM is at resting 
position as shown by the magenta lines. By controlling the 
wire pair, the UFM bends to both sides. When contacting with 
the constraint, the joints between the constraint and the robot 
base stops rotating. The other joints rotate continuously until 
reaching the limit. As shown in the figure, in the left half 
plane, the first three vertebras are confined by the constraints; 
in the right half plane, the first five vertebras are confined by 
the constraints. The end effector trajectory under UCs is as 
shown by the red curve. The blue curve is the free bending 
trajectory. The diamonds are the recorded positions. Results 
show that the model well predicts the end effector trajectory 
with UCs. The altered trajectory is bounded by the free path.

Fig. 9 End Effector Trajectory with Multiple UCs 
C. Discussions 
From the results, it is shown that the end effector trajectory 
of the USM is altered by the constraints a lot, either under 
single BC or multiple UCs. The changed trajectories are well 
predicted by the proposed method. With the aid of constraints, 
the end effector can reach a lot more positions.  
In engineering inspection and disaster relief, it is always 
desirable that the end effector can reach more positions or 
reach a position with more orientation options. Obstacles in 
these applications, such as pipelines, debris, etc., are usually 
solid and immobile. By taking advantage of these obstacles, 
the manipulator workspace can be expanded a lot. Generally, 
these obstacles are UCs. From the analysis, the workspace 
expansion is smaller than that of BC. In practice, how can we 
make the most of constraints? If we can deploy BC actively, 
the UFM has the largest workspace. This can not only expand 
UFM workspace to the largest, but more importantly, the 
UFM workspace can be expanded in cases where external 
obstacles are soft or not allowed to touch, such as tissues.  
One way is to stiffen the UFM partially. One example is the 
HARP robot developed in MCU [20]. It uses one inner tube to 
lock the posterior part of the manipulator. This is similar to 
deploying the BC. Another way is using smart materials, such 
as Magnetorheological (MR) fluid. Under magnetic field, the 
MR fluid becomes viscoelastic solid. The yield stress of the 
stiffened structure can be enhanced well above 800 kPa. By 
filling the tube with MR fluid and controlling the magnetic 
field, one can control the rigidity of the tube as well as the 
length of the stiffened part.  
VI. CONCLUSION 
In this paper, a novel idea of using obstacles to expand the 
UFM workspace is proposed. Method of deploying obstacles 
to reach a target position with desired orientation is also 
provided. The constraints are divided into two categories: UC 
and BC. The UFM workspace can be expanded by either 
constraint. The idea is validated by a wire-driven serpentine 
robotic arm. Simulations and experiments show that the 
workspace is expanded a lot. The workspace with UC is a 
subspace of the workspace with BC. The proposed idea is 
useful in applications that a large workspace is needed in 
confined space, such as minimally invasive surgery, disaster 
relief, and engineering inspection.
