Abstract—Endurance is a critical problem that most flying 
robots will definitely encounter. Inspired by flying animals in 
nature that take frequent short flights with periods of perching 
in between, we propose an innovative mechanism with flying 
and adhesion to solve this problem. Previously, we have 
developed some prototypes of flying and adhesion robots. 
However, when the robots switch between flying and adhesion, 
it is difficult to control the contact force; moreover, the robots 
could be damaged because of the abnormal contact with the 
environment. Therefore, we propose an impedance control 
approach for bio-inspired flying and adhesion robots to have 
smooth contact with the environment. The dynamic model of a 
bio-inspired robot is described, and the proposed impedance 
control method is applied to regulate the contact force with the 
environment. The bio-inspired flying and adhesion robot 
performs several phases of desired missions in the sequential 
manner. Firstly, the robot performs position control to 
approach the desired perch position. Secondly, the robot 
contacts with the environment and regulate the contact force. 
Both simulation and experiments were performed to validate 
the proposed method. The results verified the feasibility of the 
proposed control methods in controlling a bio-inspired flying 
and adhesion robot.

I. INTRODUCTION 
The flying robots have been widely used in both military 
and civilian applications. In the military fields, flying robots 
are mainly used for reconnaissance and surveillance, 
communication relay, electronic interference, as well as 
biochemical detection. In the civil aspects, they can be used to 
accomplish atmospheric monitoring, resource exploration, 
traffic monitoring, aerial photography and so on[1][2][3]. For 
such robots, flying is not power-efficient. For example, during 
the surveillance missions, current flying robots have to keep 
flying that decreases the endurance of battery dramatically. 
Typical battery powered micro-flying robots can only fly in 
tens of minutes. Thus power consumption for flying robots is a 
challenging research topic.  
An attractive alternative is to enable the flying robots to do 
what flying animals do: taking frequent short flights with 
periods of perching in between. Obviously, the energy 
efficiency of such animals is much high    er than that of flying 
robots. In particular, it is useful for small fixed-wing planes to 
perch on vertical surfaces such as cliffs or the walls of 
buildings. Clinging to such surfaces, they consume little 
power, allowing them to stay there for hours or possibly days 
as a stable platform for surveillance, inspection or

environmental monitoring. Vertical surfaces are especially 
attractive because they are often relatively uncluttered and free 
from debris [4]. 
The usefulness of reliable robot perching is recognized, 
and a number of research groups are pursuing solutions using 
a variety of methods. Anderson et al. have proposed various 
ideas for perching, such as perching with adhesives and 
weighted tail line [5]. Mirko Kovac et al. have designed a 
simple and practical perching mechanism based on the 
concept of the target surface using needles [6].Kin Huat Low 
et al. have proposed a design of bio-inspired adaptive 
perching mechanism, and it mainly focused on the static 
characteristics [7]. Still other work has focused on performing 
perching maneuvers using a morphing airplane [8, 9].  
The flying and adhesion robot, which can fly in the sky and 
anchor on a wall surface alternately, has the advantages of 
both long distance motion with the ability to overcome 
obstacles and long time stop with low energy consumption. 
Previous prototypes of flying and adhesion robots we 
proposed [10][11], as shown in Fig.1, are promising in many 
applications. However, when the robots switch between flying 
and adhesion, it is difficult to control the contact force that will 
cause damage to the robots. Traditional control methods 
[12-14] of the flying robot do not consider the force constraint 
from the environment. When the robot contacts with the 
environment, because the force balance has been broken, the 
original dynamic model will be completely ineffective. The 
approach we employed before is to make the robot hit the 
environment at certain acceleration thus the external force will 
be offset. But the problem is that it is difficult to decide how 
much acceleration should be given to the robot. If it is too 
large, it could damage the robot; and if it is too small, its 
attitude will be changed by the external force, and robots may 
hit the environment. In this paper, we propose a model based 
impedance control method for the bio-inspired flying and 
adhesion robot.  The control system performs not only 
position and attitude control but also force control in order to 
interact with the environment. Force control of robotic 
manipulators has been an active area of research for many 
reasons [15-18]. It can be extended to the flying and adhesion 
robot control system. A force measuring device is connected 
to the robot, which can measure the interaction force with the 
wall. 
This paper is structured as follows. In Section II, the 
dynamic model of the bio-inspired flying and adhesion robot 
is described, considering the situation that the mass center 
and the geometric center may not be coincident.  In Section 
III, control system of the robot is designed, mainly including 
position control and impedance force control. In Section IV 
simulations and experiments were performed based on the 
prototype we designed. The results are analyzed. Section V 
concludes the work and discusses future directions of our 
research.

II. ROBOT DYNAMICS  
In this section we will describe the dynamic model of the 
bio-inspired flying and adhesion robot. Figure 2 shows the 
prototype of the bio-inspired flying and adhesion robot we 
have designed perching on an indoor wall. The robot is based 
on a quadrotor structure and an adhesion device has been 
designed to realize the robot’s active adsorption. The 
quadrotor structure has some basic advantages over 
conventional helicopters [19] in terms of simplicity of 
dynamics and control system design. And the helicopters have 
some weakness, such as significant vibration, high levels of 
noise, relatively larger power consumption. Based on the 
prototype we designed, the dynamic model is developed.

Although there are 6 variables to represent the system, we 
have only 4 inputs: therefore the system is an under-actuated 
system. Since the motor response is fast compared to that of 
the robotic system, we assume that rotor response can be 
instantly achieved during the controller development. 
Therefore, the control inputs can be expressed in terms of the 
rotor speeds as

III. SYSTEM CONTROL 
In this section, we will present a generic controller for this 
class of under-actuated bio-inspired flying and adhesion 
robots. The purpose is to make the robots fly to a desired perch 
position, contact the environment with a desired force, and 
adhere on a surface actively. A variety of control techniques 
has been implemented successfully on robot control including 
PID and LQ and backstepping control. PID performed 
favorably compared to LQ due to its simplicity and tolerance 
for model uncertainty. Therefore, the PID control method is 
used for the position control. 
A.  Position Control 
We can define

where

the robot contacts the environment, it will be in a free space, 
and the external force will be zero. Therefore, equation (6) can 
be simplified as:

Hence its desired value

unstable system otherwise the robot will be sluggish. 
Therefore, a PD controller has been implemented for attitude 
holding. Figure 4 shows the control block diagram of the 
whole position control.

B. Impedance Control  
The inclusion of force information in the control of this 
kind of bio-inspired flying and adhesion robots will increase 
their adaptability to uncertain environments, and provide 
safety against damage due to excessive contact force. Direct 
application of above position controller designed for 
free-space robot motion usually results in instability when the 
robot is in contact with a environment, because this controller 
ignores the interaction between the robot and the environment. 
Impedance control allows us to specify the robot stiffness for a 
given task under contact with the environment.  
Suppose 
d
? and 
d
f are the desired robot motion and 
interaction force, and 
d
? is assumed to be twice continuously 
differentiable.  
Let  
d
e?? ?? and  
f d e
e f f ??                  (14) 
be the tracking errors of motion and the interaction force 
respectively, the impedance control law can described as  
                     
ff
Me De Ke K e ? ? ??                      (15) 
 The generalized impedance parameters M , D and K are 
specified as positive definite diagonal matrices, and 
f
K is the 
force stiffness matrix. 
 In the free space control, the control law can be obtained as 
follows:

 Note that when the desired force

(1,1,1) M diag ? then the robot is under position control

De Ke ?? ? ? ?                              (17) 
 Substituting the control law (17) into the dynamics of the 
bio-inspired flying and adhesion robot (6), and because the 
external force is zero during the free flight, we can obtain

IV. SIMULATION AND EXPERIMENTS 
The bio-inspired flying and adhesion robot performs 
several phases of desired missions in the sequential manner. 
Firstly, the robot performs position control to approach the 
desired perch position. Secondly, the robot contacts the 
environment regulates the contact force to achieve desired 
contact force. Thirdly, the adhesion device in the robot will 
work to make it adhere to the surface steadily as shown in 
Fig.6. Switching from adhesion to flying is an inverse process, 
the control methods is also applicable.

To accomplish the desired missions, the robot is required 
to carry a certain payload, perch on a surface actively, and 
adhere to a vertical surface under low power consumption. 
Figure 7 shows the real bio-inspired flying and adhesion robot 
we have designed for experimental studies. Table 1 lists the 
parameters of the bio-inspired robot used for simulation.

The prototype of the bio-inspired flying and adhension 
robot is based on the quadrotor structure, which also includes 
an adsorption device, a supporting system and an embedded 
controller. The adhesion device we employed here is based on 
vacuum generated by micro-pumps, which is characterized 
with low power consumption and low noise. Meanwhile, it 
can be very convenient to be installed due to its small size. The 
supporting system, on one hand, is used to improve the 
payload when the robot anchors on a surface, meanwhile it 
plays a role in protection; on the other hand, combined with a 
potentiometer, it can be used to estimate the contact force. The 
motivation for our design is that the robot could execute the 
tasks in the three dimension space with more payloads and 
obstacle-free under lower power consumption.   
In this simulation, let us consider an initial position (0, 0, 
0), and the desired position is given as (10, 5, 5)m. The 
desired motion trajectory for the x direction is given as

will track the desired position to approach the environment. 
In the free space, the desired force is zero, the robot makes 
contact at around 10s, and follows the reference force well. 
The force overshoot is about 1N. When the robot contacts 
with the environment, it brings some interference along the X 
and Y directions. Figure 8(a) shows the position tracking 
result along the X direction. After 20s, the system settled 
down.

Figure 9 shows our indoor flying and adhesion test. The 
results show that the robot flied to an indoor wall (figure 9(a)), 
and then attached to the red target area (figure 9(b)). The 
bio-inspired flying and adhesion robot stopped for the 
purpose of decreasing the power consumption (figure 9(c)) to 
execute some tasks, like reconnaissance. After the task was 
done, the adhesion device stopped to work and the robot  
switched from adhesion to flying (figure 9(d)).

V. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK  
The bio-inspired flying and adhesion robot has many 
applications and market potentials, because it can prolong the 
endurance greatly, about several times and even hundreds of 
times better than typical flying robots. However, it is difficult 
to control the robot to transit from flying to adhesion 
smoothly. Based on the dynamic model we have built, the 
position and impedance force control methods are developed 
to enable the robot to approach to a desired position and make 
contact with the environment smoothly until the adhesion 
device starts to work. Simulations and experiments were 
performed to evaluate the performances of the position and 
force tracking. The simulation and experimental results 
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. Our 
future work is to investigate the approaches of 
omni-directional adsorption and make the robot self-adapt to 
the surface in nature at any angles. Meanwhile, the micro 
wireless camera may be mounted on the robot to do some 
tasks with the use of image processing. Furthermore, other 
sensors will be integrated to control the system to accomplish 
more complex tasks.
