Abstract— The paper studies the formation control problem
for distributed robot systems. It is assumed each robot only has
access to local sensing information (i.e. the relative positions
and IDs of its neighbors). Taking into consideration physical
sensing constraints (e.g. limited sensing range) and the motion
of the robots over time, it may be noted that the sensing graph
for the system is directed and time-varying. This presents a
challenging situation for formation control. As an initiative
attempt to study this challenging situation, we suppose the
sensing graph switches among a family of graphs with certain
connectivity properties, under which a switching linear control
law is then proposed. We show that for arbitrary dwell times
or average dwell times, the proposed control law with properly
designed control parameters can ensure global convergence to
a desired formation shape. The proposed formation control law
can be implemented in a distributed manner while the design
of certain control parameters requires some global information.
I. INTRODUCTION
Distributed robot systems including autonomous under-
water, ground or aerial vehicles, which are intended to
perform coordinated tasks, have a broad range of applica-
tions ( [16], [19]) such as search and rescue operations in
hazardous environments, ocean data retrieval and sampling,
and surveillance/combat tasks. Among all the coordinated
missions, formation control has been considered as one of
the fundamental issues, with the goal of controlling a team of
autonomous robots to form a rigid or ﬂexible structure. The
research on formation control of distributed robot systems
has experienced rapid growing since the 1990s. However,
several challenges still exist and have not been fully over-
come in the situations that only local information (GPS-free)
is accessible and the sensing graph may change over time.
For realizability of rigid formations, graph rigidity is
used to characterize information architecture among robots
( [2], [8], [17]), for which relative distances between pairs
of robots are concerned. With this idea, nonlinear gradient
control strategies are developed to stabilize a group of
mobile robots into a desired rigid formation ( [4], [12]) and
maneuver a robot formation while maintaining a formation
shape ( [1], [10]). A variation is the use of bearing angle
information for the objective of formation shape control (
[3], [11]). Moreover, in responding to possible environment
changes, the problem of scaling the size of a formation

is addressed without a re-design of formation control laws
[5]. Our previous works ( [14], [20]–[22]) also establish
a new framework for formation shape control with a ﬂex-
ible formation scale, which is adaptable to environment
changes. However, unlike consensus control [13], [18], there
are few works in formation control dealing with switching
topologies, which are practically signiﬁcant due to unreliable
sensing and communications.
This paper concentrates on the switching topology case
by extending our previous work on the ﬁxed topology case
( [14], [20]–[22]). The goal is to achieve a formation shape
for a team of autonomous robots when the sensing graph
may switch over time. The scale of an achieved formation
is not a concern in the paper. This is because as shown
in [15], if a formation shape can be achieved, then the
scale of the entire formation can be controlled by only a
small portion of robots (e.g., two robots in the team). For
formation shape control under a ﬁxed sensing graph, we
show in our earlier work [21] that a formation shape is
realizable if and only if the sensing graph is 2-rooted, a
kind of connectedness in graph theory. Thus, in the paper,
we assume that the sensing graph switches over a family
of 2-rooted graphs to make the formation control problem
feasible. Under this assumption, a switching linear control
law is proposed depending on the sensing graph. It is
then shown that for any switching signal satisfying a dwell
time or average dwell time condition, which is often met
for practical systems, the proposed linear control law with
properly designed parameters ensures globally exponential
convergence of mobile robots to a desired formation shape.
The approach can also be applied for formation maneuvering
provided that their maneuvering velocities are synchronized.
Simulations and experiments using Rovio omni-directional
mobile robots are conducted to validate our theoretic results.

II. PRELIMINARY AND PROBLEM SETUP
A. Graphical notions and preliminary results
A directed graph G = (V,E) consists of a non-empty
node setV ={1,2,··· ,n} and an edge setE ?V?V. The
neighbor set of node i is denoted by N
i
={j : (j,i)?E}.
In the paper, we assume that directed graphs do not have
self-loops, i.e., i 6? N
i
for any node i. Next, we introduce
two concepts from [20]. For a directed graphG, a node v is
said to be 2-reachable from a non-singleton set U of nodes
if there exists a path from a node in U to v after removing

any one node except nodev. Moreover, a directed graphG is
said to be 2-rooted if there exists a subset of two nodes, from
which every other node is 2-reachable. These two nodes are
called roots in the graph.
Examples are given in Fig 1-3 to explain these notions.
In Fig. 1, let U ={u
1
,u
2
,u
3
}. Node v is 2-reachable from
U as after removing any one other node there is still a path
from a node in U to node v. However, in Fig. 2, v is not
2-reachable fromU because when nodeu
2
is removed, there
does not exist a path from a node inU to node v. The graph
in Fig. 3 is 2-rooted, for which nodes u
1
and u
2
are the two
roots, because nodes v
1
, v
2
, and v
3
are all 2-reachable from
U ={u
1

}.

For a directed graphG, we deﬁne a corresponding complex
Laplacian L as follows: The ijth entry
L(i,j) =

?
?
?w
ij
if i6= j and j?N

0 if i6= j and j6?N

X
j?Ni
w

if i = j
where w
ij
?C is called the complex weight on edge (j,i).
From the deﬁnition, it is true that a complex Laplacian has
at least one zero-eigenvalue whose associated eigenvector is
1
n
. Finally, we recall two preliminary results from [21] about
a complex Laplacian with minor modiﬁcations.
Lemma 2.1: Consider a directed graphG ofn nodes and a
generic vector ??C
n
. Then rank(L) = n?2 for almost all
complex LaplaciansL associated toG and satisfying L? = 0
if and only if G is 2-rooted.
Lemma 2.2: Consider a directed graphG of n nodes and
a generic vector ? ? C
n
. If G is 2-rooted, then for almost
all complex Laplacians L satisfying L? = 0, there exists a
diagonal matrix D such that the eigenvalues of DL can be
assigned at any locations in addition to two ﬁxed eigenvalues
at the origin.
B. Problem setup
We consider a group ofn robots in the plane. The positions
of n robots are denoted by complex numbers z
1
,··· ,z
n
?
C. A directed graph G = (V,E) of n nodes represents the
sensing graph in which an edge (j,i) indicates that robot i
can measure the relative position of robot j in robot i’s local
frame and also its ID. Our goal is to make then robots reach
and maintain a desired formation shape.
We use a complex number ?
i
?C (i = 1,··· ,n) to rep-
resent a point in a reference frame ?. Let the n-dimensional
composite complex vector? = [?
1
,?
2
,··· ,?
n
]
T
?C
n
be the
formation vector for then robots in the reference frame ?. In
the paper, we consider point robots and assume that ?
i
6= ?
j
if i6= j, meaning that no two robots overlap each other. For
practical applications, pairs of robots should be separated by
at least certain distance away in the target formation.
Next we introduce the concept of similar formation. For a
directed graphG and an associated complex Laplacian L, if
a conﬁguration ??C
n
satisﬁes a constraintL : L? = 0, we
call? a realization of the graphG and the linear constraintL.
A framework is a graph together with a realization, denoted
as (G,?,L) whereG is a directed graph, ? is a conﬁguration
andL represents the linear constraint L? = 0. In this paper,
a framework is deﬁned in terms of a linear constraint rather
than the distance constraints on edges as in [6], [7].
Deﬁnition 2.1: A framework (G,?,L) is said similar if
ker(L) ={c
1
1
n
+c
2
? : c
1
,c
2
?C}.
Remark 2.1: Note that a complex number c
2
can be
written in the polar coordinate form (namely, c
2
= ?e
??
).
So the solutions to the linear constraint L? = 0 consist of
points related by translations c
1
, rotations ?, and scaling ?
(four degrees of freedom). That is, the formations subject to
the linear constraintL? = 0 are scalable from the formation?
in addition to rigid body motions (translations and rotations).
Moreover, it is worth to point out that if there is additional
distance constraints on at least one edge, the framework then
becomes globally rigid with a determined size.
In our previous work [20], [21], we have derived the
necessary and sufﬁcient graphical condition for a framework
to be similar, which is stated below.
Theorem 2.1 ( [20], [21]): A framework (G,?,L) is sim-
ilar for almost all L and ? if and only if G is 2-rooted.
The theorem says that in order to reach a formation shape
for a group of n robots, the sensing graph G should be 2-
rooted. Otherwise, with insufﬁcient number of information
links, a group of n robots is never able to reach a desired
formation shape. In the paper, we consider a sensing graph
that may switch over time as the robots evolve. Denote by
{G
p
: p?P} the family of possible sensing graphs that the
robots may take. But in order to make the formation shape
control problem feasible, we assume in the following that
A1:G
p
is 2-rooted for all p?P.
For robots modeled by continuous time dynamics
˙ z
i
(t) = u
i
(t), i = 1,...,n, (1)
the aim of the paper is to design a distributed control law
such that a network of robots can globally exponentially
reach and maintain a formation shape (i.e., similar to a
desired formation ?) under switching sensing topologies.
III. DISTRIBUTED FORMATION CONTROL AND
STABILITY
In this section, we ﬁrst propose a distributed formation
control law under switching topologies. Next, we show
that under dwell time (average dwell time) conditions with
arbitrarily small dwell time (average dwell time), our pro-
posed control law with properly designed control param-
eters ensures globally exponential convergence of multi-
robot formations. Finally, we discuss the design, distributed
3596
implementation, and extension to formation maneuvering of
our control law.
A. A switching formation control law
We denote by G
?(t)
a switching sensing graph with ?:
[0,∞) ? P being a piecewise constant switching signal,
and denote byN
i
(t) the set of neighbors at t. For a generic
formation ? ? C
n
and for any p ? P, we select complex
weights w
ij
(p)’s associated to edges (j,i)’s on graph G
p
such that the complex Laplacian L
p
associated with G
p
and complex weights w
ij
(p) satisﬁes L
p
? = 0. Detailed
explanation on how to pre-calculate complex weights will
be given in Subsection III-C. Without loss of generality, we
assume that rank(L
p
) = n? 2 as it can always be assured
for 2-rooted graphG
p
’s by Lemma 2.1.
The following linear switching control law is proposed for
each robot i = 1,...,n:
u
i
= d
i
(?(t))
X
j?Ni(t)
w
ij
(?(t))(z
j
?z
i
), (2)
where d
i
(?(t))?C is a control parameter to be designed.
Under the distributed control law (2), the overall closed-
loop dynamics of n continuous-time robots becomes
˙ z =?D
?(t)
L
?(t)
z (3)
where z ? C
n
is the aggregate state vector of n robots,
D
?(t)

n
(?(t))} is an n-by-n diago-
nal complex matrix, andL
?(t)
is a complex Laplacian matrix
associated to G
?(t)
.
It is clear that the switched system (3) switches its
dynamics from a family of subsystems
˙ z =?D
p
L
p
z, p?P. (4)
However, the stability of all subsystems does not ensure
the stability of the switched system (3). But notice that in
practical applications, the sensing graph usually does not
switch arbitrarily fast. In other words, it must satisfy a dwell
time constraint or an average dwell time constraint. In the
following, we are going to show that under a dwell time or
average dwell time condition, globally exponential stability
of multi-robot formations can be guaranteed by a properly
designed control gain D
p
for every subsystem.
B. Stability analysis
First, we introduce the concept of dwell time. Suppose the
switching signal ?(t) switches its value at time instants t
1
,
t
2
, ... . We say the switching signal has dwell time ?
D
if
t
i+1
?t
i
≥ ?
D
for all i’s. We denote byS(?
D
) the set of all
switching signals with dwell time ?
D
, i.e.,
S(?
D
) ={?(t) : t
i+1
?t
i
≥ ?
D
for all i}.
We then present a main result to show that the switched
system (3) can be made globally exponentially convergent
under a dwell time condition.
Theorem 3.1: For any ?
D
> 0 and any switching signal
?(t) ? S(?
D
), there exist D
p
’s, p ? P, such that a net-
work of n robots globally exponentially reaches a formation
(similar to ?) under the distributed control law (2).
Proof: Let e
i
be the n-dimensional vector whose ith
entry is 1 and all others are 0. Then we deﬁne an n? n
matrix
Q =

Furthermore,M

Consider the coordinate transformation y = Q

switched system (3). Then it can be obtained that

y.
Let x be a sub-vector of y consisting of the ﬁrst n? 2
components of z. Then it is clear that
˙ x = M
?(t)
x. (6)
It is true that globally exponential stability of (6) is equiv-
alent to globally exponential convergence of n robots to a
formation similar to ?.
Suppose temporarily that for any p ? P, ˙ x = M
p
x is
exponentially stable. That is, there exist positive constants
c and ?

such that ke

for a constant ?

,... the time instants, at
which the switching occurs and suppose ?(t) = p

and thus
kx(t

Also, notice that for t in any interval [t

, (7)
then for any switching signal ?(t) ? S(?
D
), the switched
system (6) is globally exponentially stable, implying that the
3597
n robots globally exponentially reach the desired formation
shape.
Finally, we show for any given ?
D
how ?
D

can
be satisﬁed by properly designingD
p
’s. Suppose without loss
of generality that D
p
is of the form D
p
= ?
p
D
?
p
where ?
p
is
a positive real constant andD
?
p
is a complex diagonal matrix.
Since every G
p
is 2-rooted, then by Lemma 2.2 it follows
that the eigenvalues of D
?
p
L
p
, p ? P, can be assigned in
the right complex plane in addition to two ﬁxed eigenvalues
at the origin by designing a proper D
?
p
. Moreover, notice
that c in (7) is a parameter satisfying ke
Mpt
k ≤ ce
??0t
for all p ? P, which relates to the eigenvectors of M
p
(or equivalently D
?
p
L
p
), p ? P, as ?
p
does not change
the eigenvectors. However, the choice of ?
p
can change the
locations of non-zero eigenvalues and thus can change ?
0
to any value. Therefore, the condition ?
D
≥
lnc
?0??c
can be
met by selecting a proper D
p
(namely, D
?
p
and ?
p
). Thus,
the conclusion follows.
Theorem 3.1 shows that if a switching signal has dwell
time ?
D
, then the n robots can reach a desired formation
shape under the proposed control law. However, in certain
situations, the switching signals may occasionally have con-
secutive discontinuities separated by less than ?
D
, but for
which the average interval between consecutive discontinu-
ities is no less than ?
D
. This leads to the concept of average
dwell time. For a switching signal ?(t), we let N
?
(t
0
,t)
denote the number of discontinuities of ?(t) in the interval
[t
0
,t). Then the set of all switch signals with average dwell
time ?
D
and chatter bound N

is denoted as
S

D
,N

) ={?(t) : N
?
(t

,t)≤ N

+
t?t

?
D
}.
Roughly speaking, as the time interval is long enough, the
average dwell time is approximately ?
D
considering the
upper-bound of the number of discontinuities in the interval.
Then we have the following result in terms of average dwell
time.
Theorem 3.2: For any switching signal ?(t) ?
S

D
,N

) with any average dwell time ?
D
> 0
and arbitrary chatter bound N

, there exist D
p
’s, p ? P,
such that a network of n robots globally exponentially
reaches a formation (similar to ?) under the distributed
control law (2).
Proof: From the proof of Theorem 3.1, we know that
there exist D

meaning that the switched system (6) is globally exponen-

C. Design of control parameters and distributed implemen-
tation
In order to run the control law (2) for the purpose of forma-
tion shape control, the parameters should be pre-computed.
It consists of two main steps. The ﬁrst is the design ofw
ij
(p)
for each robot i and for j ? N
i
in every possible sensing
graph G
p
. This can be done in a distributed manner. That
is, the complex weights w
ij
(p) can be calculated by robot i
from the following equation
X
j?Ni(Gp)
w
ij
(p)(?
j
??
i
) = 0
as ?
j
’s for j?N
i
(G
p
) are available to robot i. It should be
pointed out that the solution may not be unique. The second
is the design of D
p
. A distributed approach for the design of
D
p
is challenging and is still unknown. Thus, a centralized
way is considered in the paper. First, a diagonal matrix D
?
p
(introduced in the proof of Theorem 3.1) is designed using
the homotopy Newton iteration method ( [21]) to assign the
eigenvalues of D
?
p
L
p
in the right complex plane in addition
to two ﬁxed eigenvalues at the origin. Second, a sufﬁciently
large ?
p
(introduced in the proof of Theorem 3.1) is chosen
to satisfy the condition?
D
≥
lnc
?0??c
for any given dwell time
or average dwell time ?
D
. Thus, D
p
= ?
p
D
?
p
is obtained.
Next, we discuss distributed and local implantation of the
switching control law (2). First of all, the linear control
law (2) uses only the relative positions (i.e., (z
j
? z
i
),
j?N
i
(t)) of its neighbors at t. It is locally implementable
by onboard sensors without requiring all the robots to have
a common sense of direction and scale unit. However, a
common notion of clockwise rotation should be shared by
all the robots. Consider for example that robot i has two
neighbors j and k. With an onboard sensor (e.g., camera)
on robot i, it can measure the relative states z
j
? z
i
and
z
k
? z
i
in its own local frame with the x-axis coincident
to the optical axis. Then the control input is obtained by
a linear combination of the two relative positions using
complex weights also deﬁned in its own local frame. A
more detailed discussion on how to locally implement a
control law on a point-mass robot using relative position
measurements refers to [13] (pages 141-143). Second, as
evident from (2), implementing the local control law requires
every robot to know the switching sensing graph under which
the robots are operating. The entire sensing graph is a piece
of global information, but it can be known by all the robots in
3598
a distributed way. At time t, each robot i knows its neighbor
set N
i
(t). By knowing this, robot i then knows a subset
of graphs, which the current entire sensing graph belongs to,
denoted byP
i
(0) ={p?P :N
i
(G
p
) =N
i
(t)}. Every robot
exchanges P
i
(k) with its neighbors and updates P
i
(k + 1)
according to
P
i
(k +1) =P
i
(k)
\
j?Mi
P
j
(k),
where M
i
represents the set of communication neighbors
of robot i. As long as the communication graph has certain
connectivity property, the iteration converges in ﬁnite steps
and leads to a unique solution p, that is the sensing graph at
timet. Thus, the switching control law (2) can be determined.
Finally, we discuss a possible extension to formation

IV. SIMULATION AND EXPERIMENT
A. A simulation result
We consider an example consisting of 9 robots. Suppose
the sensing graph switches over{G
p
: p = 1,2} periodically.
The graphs G
1
and G
2
are shown in Fig. 4, both of which
are 2-rooted with roots{4,6} forG
1
and roots{1,3} forG
2
.
The switching signal is shown in Fig. 5.

0.02?, 1.1 + 0.05?, 1.1? 0.05?, 0.8 + 0.020?, 0, 0}. It
also makes the dwell time condition hold. In the simulation,
we suppose all the agents take the control law (8) with a
common reference velocity v
0
= 4+3?.
Fig. 6 records the trajectories of the 9 robots using the
proposed distributed control law. The blue circles are the
initial positions of the robots and the red diamonds represent
the positions of the robots at the end of the simulation.
Moreover, the trajectories in blue indicate that during that
interval, the sensing graph isG
1
while the trajectories in red
indicate that during that interval, the sensing graph isG

B. An experiment result
Our proposed formation control law is also implemented
on a group of Rovio mobile robots under switching sensing
topologies. The Rovio robots contain a true-track beacon,
with which they can localize themselves [9], but in the
experiment we convert the absolute location information to
relative positions as speciﬁed by the directed graphs in Fig. 7.
The Rovio robot is equipped with three omni-directional
wheels so that they can move freely in the plane like a point
mass.

We consider four Rovio robots for our formation control
experiment. The switching signal is also the periodic one
shown in Fig. 5, which switches the sensing graph between

in Fig. 7. We consider a square formation shape,
described by ? = [1+2?, ?1+2?, ?1, 1]
T
. The formation
control law is implemented in a sampled-data setup. The

To meet the dwell time condition, D1 = diag{0.9244 +

With a common reference velocity v

trajectories of the four Rovio robots are plotted in Fig. 8,
which shows the four Rovio robots asymptotically converge
to form and maintain a square formation shape. A snapshot

V. CONCLUSION
The paper developed a distributed control strategy for for-
mation shape control of autonomous robots under switching
sensing topologies. It is practical that a dwell time or average
dwell time condition is often satisﬁed. Thus, with a known
dwell time (average dwell time) constant, we showed that
our proposed distributed control schemes are effective with
properly designed control gains. However, in this work we
assumed that the sensing graph switches over a family of
2-rooted graphs. Certainly, the sensing graph may become
not 2-rooted sometimes in practical setting and it is more
interesting to see whether our distributed control strategies
still work for the situation that the sensing graph switches
among all possible topologies.
