Model and Control of a Flap System Mitigating Wind Impact on
Structures
Maria Boberg, Glauco Feltrin and Alcherio Martinoli
Abstract— In this work, we investigate a model-based control
for a ﬂap system aiming at mitigating wind-induced vibrations
of long-span bridges. Our contribution is threefold: ﬁrst, we
developed an integrated ﬂap system able to control a bridge
section model; second, we proposed a model able to prop-
erly capture the nonlinear interaction between wind and the
structure; third, we optimized a linear control law for the ﬂap
position able to robustly cope with the nonlinear forces exerted
on the ﬂap. The model accuracy and the system performance
were systematically validated by wind tunnel experiments.
I. INTRODUCTION
Long-span bridges are particularly vulnerable to wind
loads, owing to their inherently low structural damping,
low natural frequencies, and adjacent fundamental torsional
and vertical mode frequencies. This leads to wind-induced
instabilities, causing potential damage to the whole structure.
Most solutions for this problem deployed on real bridges
consist of passive elements that reduce the aerodynamic
requirements on the cross-section [1]. However, a passive
solution cannot adapt to dynamic wind conditions. Active
solutions could potentially lead to a more favorable perfor-
mance/cost trade-off in the building and maintenance phases
as well as new opportunities for improving bridge aesthetics.
One possible active solution is to install multiple mobile
ﬂaps along the bridge girder in order to alter its aerodynamic
proﬁle, enabling stabilizing forces on the structure, a concept
illustrated in Fig. 1. Furthermore, the angular position of the
adjustable ﬂaps is controlled as a function of the wind ﬁeld
and/or the displacement of the structure whose dynamic state
can be measured with an underlying sensor network.
Although several control strategies for damping bridge
deck oscillations, in particular the ﬂutter phenomenon, have
been investigated, only two research groups have provided
experimental validation of active bridge ﬂutter control.
Kobayashi and Nagaoka managed to increase the wind speed
at which ﬂutter occurs by 50% [2]. Hansen was also able
to increase the ﬂutter velocity with active control using a
new bridge section model design (larger scale, and different
ﬂap placement) [3]. Both research groups used bridge section
models endowed with a single ﬂap on each side of the girder.
We aim to extend the investigation of active ﬂutter control
to bridge section models endowed with multiple ﬂaps, such

that distributed control strategies can be studied and validated
experimentally. Towards this goal, we have focused on the
mechatronic design and control of a single ﬂap. A core
challenge for an effective control law design, is to properly
capture the nonlinear, noisy wind force exerted on the ﬂap.
Neither Kobayashi nor Hansen, who aimed to investigate
the feasability of active ﬂutter control using ﬂaps, directly
addressed the issue of position control of a single ﬂap. When
designing the ﬂutter control they both employed a model
introduced by Kobayashi: essentially two coupled linear dif-
ferential equations (of the bridge deck and ﬂap displacements
and their time derivatives) based on the wing-aileron-tab
conﬁguration model developed by Theodorsen and Garrick
[4]. However, the model assumptions (e.g., no ﬂow inﬂuence
of upwind elements on downwind elements) are strong and
their theoretical results did not match experimental data well.
Fowler and D’Andrea performed wind tunnel experiments
researching aircraft ﬂight formation [5]. They employed a
manually tuned linear control law for the ﬂap actuation.
The ﬂap angle was controlled in an open-loop fashion by
a servo motor, while the control signal to the servo motor
was generated in a closed-loop fashion taking into account
the yaw and roll of the airfoil. The dynamic response of the
system to the control input was captured by a fourth-order
state-space model. However, they did not model the actual
underlying physical mechanism of the interaction between
the ﬂap and the surrounding wind ﬁeld.
In this work, we propose a model-based approach, well-
anchored to physical reality, allowing for ﬁne tuning of a
linear control law and its corresponding parameters. Not only
does the model-based approach provide a safe control tuning
environment, but also a ﬂexible and fast platform for testing

new control laws. Furthermore, a method for identifying the
model parameters from experimental data is proposed, and
the approach is validated with our prototype ﬂap in a wind
tunnel. The model was developed in Matlab Simulink
R 
.
Our proposed model can be extended to include the bridge
deck dynamics, and Kobayashi’s model is a good starting
point. However, this is not within the scope of this paper.
II. MATERIAL AND METHODS
In order to investigate the control of the ﬂap, we designed
a dedicated test rig, as seen in Fig. 2(a). The ﬂap prototype
is made of ABS plastic and was manufactured using a 3D
printer; the design is symmetric (width: 400 mm, chord
length: 134 mm, max thickness: 49 mm) and both motor
and driver ﬁt inside, as seen in Fig. 2(b). In our setup
we used a 20W DC motor with graphite brushes (model:
118751), gear reduction rate of 53:1 (model: 144035) op-
tical encoder (model: 225778), and a digital positioning
controller (model: 390003), all from Maxon Motor Inc. The
manufacturer provides an auto-tuning function that allows
quick tuning of the motor control parameters (proportional,
integral, and derivative coefﬁcients). The tuning criterion
can be set between a hard and a soft response, however,
full tuning transparency is not provided. Running the auto-
tuning procedure for the control parameters when the motor
is placed inside the ﬂap is possible. However, even when the
ﬂap is subjected to low wind speeds, the software aborts the
tuning operation due to the nonsteady forces. Therefore, in
this paper whenever auto-tuned parameters are mentioned,
they were tuned with the ﬂap mounted, but without wind.
The motor’s speed and torque requirements were based
on approximate calculations and previous work within this
ﬁeld. The required ﬂap speed depends on the motion of the
bridge deck it controls since it will probably move at the
same frequency, but with a different amplitude. The ﬂap in
Hansen’s experimental setup moved at a frequency of 1.5

and frequency, with movements of30

ms and corresponds to 6.25 Hz.
The experiments were carried out in a boundary layer wind
tunnel (dimensions: 1.5x2x10m) with a top wind speed of 16
m/s. The test rig was placed near the inlet, as seen in Fig. 3.
III. MODEL DESIGN
Our aim is to capture the experimental setup with a model
that is well anchored to the physical reality. A control system
is typically represented by a controller and a plant, which in
our case corresponds to the ﬂap with the control unit and the
motor mounted inside. Moreover, there are external forces
that disturb our system, i.e. the gravity and the wind force.
A schematic overview of the system is presented in Fig. 4.
The manufacturer provides a position control with a cas-
cade structure with an inner PI current control loop, G
1
,
and an outer PID position control loop, G
2
, and augmented
by a speed and acceleration feed forward block, G
FF
. The
ﬂap and the DC motor are modeled by the process blocks
P
1
, P
2
, the back emf constant, K
e
, and the motor torque
constant, K
t
. The external forces acting on the ﬂap, gravity
and wind, are assumed to be nonlinear functions of the ﬂap
angle and are modeled by the external torque block,
ext
, in
Fig. 4. The various parts of the model are represented in the
frequency domain by Laplace transforms. In the following
sections each part of the model is described in detail.
A. The Plant: DC Motor and Flap
The DC motor is modeled with an electrical part (P
1
,
K
e
and K
t
) and a mechanical part (P
2
). The back emf
voltage is proportional to the motor speed, V
e
= K
e
_
,
and following Lenz’s law it is always counteracting the
armature voltage, V
A
. The resulting voltage generates the
motor armature current, I
A
, and is modeled by P
1
. The
electrical torque produced by the motor is proportional to the
armature current,

(including losses) generates the motor speed and is modeled
by P

whereL is the motor inductance,R is the motor resistance,
J is the rotor inertia, b is the viscous friction constant and
s is the Laplace variable.
Mounting the motor in the ﬂap increases the plant’s inertia
and friction (mechanical and air resistance). This is simply
accounted for by adjusting the mechanical parameters (J and
b) and by adding a constant friction,

B. PID Position Control
The motor position control is modeled by three parts: an
inner current control loop, an outer position control loop,
and a speed and acceleration feed forward,

Furthermore, the output of blocksG

are limited by 18
V olt and 3 Ampere, respectively. An anti-wind up method is
implemented in order to avoid a growing integral part when
the blocks are saturated. The details about the method the
controller unit uses is not disclosed by the manufacturer;
in our Matlab Simulink
R 
model a conditional integration
method (also called integrator clamping) is used [6].
C. Modeling External Forces
Gravity and wind are the external forces acting on the ﬂap
that are considered in our model. However, only the force
components that are perpendicular to the ﬂap’s symmetry
axis, as seen in Fig. 5, contribute to the motor torque. In
the following sections the gravity and wind force models are
described in detail.

G

ﬂap angle and cr , cm and cw are the center of rotation, mass, and wind
respectively.
1) Gravity Model: Since the ﬂap’s center of mass and
axis of rotation are not aligned, the gravity will affect the
motor torque. The gravity-induced torque

tion (9.81 m/s

2) Wind Model: Assuming that the ﬂap is ﬂat (i.e. negli-
gible thickness), the wind-induced torque

D
is the drag force, r
W
is the distance between the center of rotation (c
r
) and the
aerodynamic center (c
w
), and  is the ﬂap’s angle of attack.
The aerodynamic center for a symmetric airfoil is typically
located 1/4 of the chord length behind the leading edge and
does not change position as the angle of attack does [8].

where  is air density, U is the wind speed, A is the ﬂap
surface area, and C
D
and C
L
are the drag coefﬁcient and
lift coefﬁcient, respectively.
The drag and lift coefﬁcients depend on the object’s shape,
surface roughness, Reynolds number, and ﬂuid properties.
Changing the ﬂap’s angle of attack is essentially equivalent
to changing the object’s shape. Therefore, the coefﬁcients are
functions of the ﬂap’s angle of attack, C
D
() and C
L
().
The drag and lift coefﬁcients for different angles of attack
can be estimated experimentally; extensive experimental re-
sults are available from wind tunnel tests on National Advi-
sory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) standard airfoils.
Sheldahl and Klimas present an experimental study of ex-
tracting the lift and drag coefﬁcients of a series of symmetric
NACA airfoils [7], with angles of attack ranging from 0

to 180

. Although our ﬂap cannot exactly be classiﬁed as a
NACA airfoil, it is symmetric and the measured drag and lift
coefﬁcients for the airfoil with the closest dimensions to our
ﬂap (with a 15% thickness-to-chord length ratio compared to
37% for our ﬂap) are given in Fig. 6. The drag coefﬁcient,
in Fig. 6(a), is as one can expect maximized at 90

(vertical
position) and zero at 0

and 180

(horizontal positions).
In Fig. 6(b) the effect of stall on the lift coefﬁcient can
be seen at approximately 15

. When the airfoil stalls, the
airﬂow separates from the back, the pressure drops and the
lift decreases. The angle at which stall occurs depends on the
airfoil shape, the ﬂuid properties, and the Reynolds number.
Furthermore, C
L
() can be approximated by the theory
of thin wings for small angles of attack. To summarize the
theory, any arbitrary airfoil is assumed to behave like a thin
plate, with a proportional relationship between the angle of
attack and the lift coefﬁcient as described in [8]:

in the stable region (before stall) between C

and  can
be veriﬁed by looking at Fig. 6(b), where the NACA airfoil
experimental results are reasonably well modeled (until 10

roughly) by the thin wing theory (10). However, since the
operating range of our ﬂap include larger angles, a better
model is required. We propose a nonlinear model that also
captures the attenuation of C

IV. MODEL VALIDATION
The approach for experimental validation of the models
described previously is detailed in the following sections.
A. Plant Model
The parameters for the DC motor model given in the data
sheets were veriﬁed by comparing the model output and the
measured output for the motor without ﬂap or external forces.
However, the mechanical parameters J, b and 
F
need to
be re-evaluated for the motor mounted in the ﬂap. In order to
avoid gravity interference with the parameter estimation the
ﬂap was placed vertically. Usually, b and 
F
are estimated
by performing a series of constant speed experiments, when
there is no acceleration and a linear relationship between the
measured armature current and motor speed is obtained, as
can be seen in (13). However, at high speeds, this method
implies a ﬂap movement of several rotations, an operation
which is limited by cables in our test rig. Instead, we estimate
all three parameters simultaneously with a series of position
steps (varying the reference trajectories), whereJ,b and
F
are tuned in order to minimize the Mean Square Error (MSE)
between the measured and simulated position trajectories.
Since the search space is small, a systematic parameter sweep
(see Table I) sufﬁced for estimating these parameters.

B. Gravity Model
The motor torque can be calculated from the measured
armature current, as 
M
= K
t
I
A
. While holding a static
position, the motor torque is counteracting the external torque
applied to the ﬂap. The gravity torque can thus indirectly be
measured when there is no wind force applied. The motor
torque was measured at different ﬂap angles (1536 samples
taken at each position). The model parameters m and r
G
were extracted from the Computer Aided Design (CAD)
model of the ﬂap. The mass of the motor and control unit
was not considered since their center of mass is aligned with
the ﬂap’s center of rotation.
The result from the static position measurements is com-
pared to the gravity model described by (6) in Fig. 7. The
measured gravity torque is slightly asymmetric and noisy.
The asymmetry might be due to the fact that the weight is
not evenly distributed along the symmetry axis of the ﬂap
(top and down), or possibly due to asymmetries of the motor.
However, the gravity model was not further developed, since
the asymetry effect is insigniﬁcant within the considered
operating range (30

), and the noise was ignored due to
its negligible effect on the highly repeatable dynamic step
responses (see Subsection IV-D).
C. Wind Model
The wind model was validated following the same experi-
mental procedure as for the gravity model. The motor torque
was measured at the same static angles, while the ﬂap was
under maximum wind load (16 m/s). The measured motor
torque then counteracts the combined effect of gravity, lift,

and drag. The combined wind torque (lift and drag) was
obtained by subtracting the mean measured gravity torque
from the measured motor torque, and is presented in Fig. 8.
Note that the ﬂap stalls at approximately 30

.
The drag and lift coefﬁcients, C
D
() and C
L
() cannot
directly be estimated from the combined wind torque. Except
at a 90

angle, where there is only drag and no lift present,
which allowsC
D90
in (12) to be estimated (to 2.0). Further-
more, by leveraging the drag coefﬁcient model,C
Ls
in (11)
can be estimated (to 2.9) from the measured wind torque at
the stall angle. The resulting models of C
D
() and C
L
()
for the ﬂap are seen in Fig. 6(a) and Fig. 6(b) respectively.
The resulting wind torque models, from applying both the
thin wing theory and our proposed lift coefﬁcient model, are
presented in Fig. 8. Even at small angles the thin wing theory
does not capture the wind torque particularly well. This is
not surprising since the approximation is stronger for the
ﬂap (larger thickness-to-chord ratio) compared to the airfoil.
However, our wind model for the ﬂap is validated within,
and slightly beyond, the operating range.
D. Overall System Model
In order to validate the dynamic model, presented in
Section III (see Fig. 4), experimental data from position
step responses at different wind speeds were compared
with the model output. Note that the outcome of these
steps, presented in Fig. 9, is highly repeatable in any wind
condition. The same control parameters were implemented

the manufacturer’s auto-tuning function. It is clear that the
Matlab Simulink
R 
model is able to capture the ﬂap dynamics
and the wind effect.
V. TUNING CONTROL PARAMETERS
The ﬂap position should ideally follow the reference
trajectory closely. However, as seen in Fig. 9, this is not
the case: even without wind there is a noticeable overshoot.
Therefore, we performed an ofﬂine optimization of the
control parameters in our developed system model.

are the control
parameters that can be tuned. However, not all of them have
the same impact in terms of overall system performance. For
instance, the current control parameters (K
P1
and K
I1
) are
already well tuned by the auto-tuning and further optimiza-
tion has only a minimal effect. Moreover, the speed feed
forward, K
!
, was set to zero by the auto-tuning function,
and our simulation conﬁrms that increasing it only has a
negative effect on the system performance. In the end, the
following control parameters were tuned: K
P2

and K

.
Appropriate control parameter ranges were chosen manu-
ally (in simulation), and are presented in Table II. The bound-
aries were chosen to avoid unstable regions or saturation
effects. The increments were set as large as possible, while
maintaining an insigniﬁcant effect on the performance.
A systematic parameter sweep was made, with the MSE
between the actual (simulated) position and the reference
position as tuning criterion. The parameters were tuned for
two wind speeds, 0 and 16 m/s, and the identiﬁed control
parameters for the two scenarios are presented in Table II.
The control parameters identiﬁed by the auto-tuning and
the model-based tuning were validated with our experimental

with wind. Furthermore, the model-based tuning, in any wind
condition, but especially without wind, performs signiﬁcantly
better than the auto-tuning. This is also evident in Fig. 10,
where a qualitative representation of the result is presented.
VI. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we proposed and validated a physically
grounded model for a ﬂap system operating in diverse wind
conditions. We used this model to design and optimize a
linear control law for the position of the ﬂap. While in this
paper we focused exclusively on the position control, the
proposed model is detailed enough to allow tuning of control
laws concerned with speed and torque.
The emphasis of this work has been on validating the
model, while the tuning approach of the control parameters
was crude and only to the point of showing a valid result.
However, we showed that a parameter tuning based on
our model outperforms the auto-tuning function provided
by the manufacturer. Moreover, although more sophisticated
optimization algorithms could be used, we are approaching
the performance limit of the linear control, possibly also the
physical limits of the motor, for this application.
Finally, the results indicate that little or nothing is gained
by varying the control parameters depending on the wind
speed. Control parameters tuned for the harshest conditions,
maximal wind speed in our case, perform very well also for
lower wind speeds within the desired range of operation.
In the near future, we will build our active bridge model,
which will allow us to properly determine the ﬂap require-
ments when operating as an array anchored to a structure.
