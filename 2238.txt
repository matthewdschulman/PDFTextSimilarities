Abstract— Without access to GPS and high-quality visual
landmarks, many autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV) face
a fundamental navigation vs. cost tradeoff: advanced navi-
gation systems that might include an INS, Doppler velocity,
or long-baseline acoustics are expensive. Supporting low-cost
operations, this work focuses on collaborative positioning for
a team of AUV’s, given a bathymetric terrain map, and only
an altimeter and acoustic modem on each vehicle. The joint
localization is performed via decentralized particle ﬁltering,
where we extend the usual measurement model to allow
received information to modulate the importance function.
We investigate the impact on performance of sensor noise,
communication interval and number of vehicles. Results are
shown for bathymetry maps near St. John’s Island, Singapore,
and for the Charles River Basin, Boston. In the second case,
we ran our algorithm with physical measurements from actual
vehicles executing trajectories.
I. INTRODUCTION
Modern AUV’s often carry proprioceptive navigation sen-
sors such as an Inertial Navigation System (INS) and/or
a Doppler Velocity Log (DVL). Although dead-reckoning
from these sensors provides short-term positioning, accuracy
will degrade over time. Surfacing periodically to get a
GPS absolute ﬁx may be an option for some missions, but
surfacing can jeopardize the vehicles’ safety when they are
operating near busy shipping channels, or in rough seas. Sur-
facing from signiﬁcant depth also consumes time and energy.
Alternatively, navigation methods that involve deploying
acoustic beacons are sometimes used. Among these are Long
Baseline (LBL) [1], Ultra-Short Baseline (USBL) [2] and
GPS Intelligent Buoy (GIB) [3] arrangements, which provide
a georeference to correct an AUV’s positioning errors. These
methods not only require considerable operational effort, but
they also are limited by their operating range, and are costly.
Current needs for lower-cost operation and for multi-
vehicle missions have motivated interest in non-conventional
navigation systems. As one approach, such systems may
exploit seabed features. Bathymetry-based localization and
navigation, also known as Terrain Relative Navigation
(TRN) [4], Terrain-aided Navigation (TAN) [5], and
Bathymetric-aided Navigation (BAN) [6] has gained the at-
tention of researchers for its ability to keep positioning errors

bounded. Given a bathymetric map, the idea of bathymetry-
based localization is essentially to match a set of water depth
measurements with the map, in order to estimate the vehicle’s
position. The performance of this localization technique
obviously depends heavily on the variability of bathymetry
in the area of operation. Bathymetry-based localization is
possible for a single vehicle, but a multi-vehicle mission
with communications and ranging capability can extend
the possibilities considerably. Fitted with acoustic modems,
AUVs today can exchange data packets, and exploit the
travel time as a range measurement, e.g., [7]. The range
measurements provide geometric constraints, and the data
exchange enables a distributed localization process.
In this paper, we address the above considerations through
a multi-vehicle underwater collaborative localization algo-
rithm. The scenario is shown in Fig. 1.
II. RELATED WORK AND PROBLEM FORMULATION
A. Background
Bathymetry-based localization generally employs sequen-
tial Bayesian ﬁltering to estimate the probability of a vehicle
being at a particular location in the map, using process and
measurement models [4], [5], [6]. Since there is no closed-
form solution for the posterior probability density, due to
the highly non-linear bathymetric measurement model, we
have pursued sequential Monte Carlo ﬁltering methods [8].
One popular implementation is the Marginalized Particle
Filter [9], [10], known for its computational efﬁciency in
approximating the density function. In several marine appli-
cations, the data for the vehicle’s measurement model are

provided by on-board multi-beam echo sounders [4], [11].
This enables multiple simultaneous altimeter measurements
at every time step and improves the ﬁlter’s performance.
Furthermore, if the vehicle is ﬁtted with a DVL, velocity
information will be available for more accurate propagation
of the process model. With only a single-beam echo sounder,
however, the ﬁlter may diverge due to multiple occur-
rences of similar terrain information within the bathymetry
map [12].
In recent years, inter-vehicle acoustic communication has
been used extensively for single beacon cooperative navi-
gation [7], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17]. Although subject to
extremely limited communication bandwidth and range, our
previous work [14], [15] has demonstrated that it is indeed
possible to minimize positioning error for a group of AUV’s
by maintaining one beacon vehicle that has good positioning
information. In more recent work, the authors in [18] fused
both acoustic ranging and bathymetric information (obtained
by side-scan sonar) to better estimate a vehicle’s position.
Another related work was reported in [19], though the
focus was on observability analysis using only the acoustic
communications and depth measurements.
Despite advances in underwater communications, conven-
tional methods of sharing a subset of particles [20] in the
implementation of a distributed particle ﬁlter simply cannot
be applied in the underwater domain due to extremely limited
bandwidth and reliability. Various particle distribution aggre-
gations have been developed as alternatives for alleviating
communication limits [21], [22], but none of them have been
applied in the underwater domain.
We adopt the ﬁltering technique mentioned in [23] for
the vehicle’s position estimation. The main idea is that each
vehicle runs (locally) a collaborative ﬁlter and broadcasts its
local sufﬁcient statistics (belief) at every communication pe-
riod, instead of set of particles. We extend the measurement
model to incorporate the information obtained from inter-
vehicle acoustic communication, and this helps to alleviate
the problem of over-conﬁdence reported in [16], [17], since
the individual vehicles’ positions and error covariances are
estimated solely from their own bathymetry measurements
between the times of acoustic communication. The process
model is driven using only the AUV’s control inputs and
a model that predicts AUV velocity based on the thruster
control input and an onboard compass.

III. MEASUREMENT MODEL
The likelihood function in (7) depends on the vehicle’s
measurement model. For the case of single vehicle localiza-
tion, the measurement consists of the water depth estimate
(AUV altitude measurement + AUV depth measurement) at
the location of the AUV . Whenever acoustic communication
is available, the measurement model also incorporates infor-
mation from other vehicles.
A. Single Vehicle
Without acoustic ranging and information from peer vehi-
cles, the measurement only consists of the vehicle’s water
depth along its trajectory. Each of the particles keeps a
history of the previous time step’s measurement. It is then
used to subtract the current time step’s measurement to obtain
the difference in water depth of the terrain between the
two positions where the measurements were taken. Fig. 2
shows the altitude measurements as well as the difference in
water depth deduced from the information between the time
steps. Observing changes in water depth has the advantage
of eliminating tidal offsets.
The weights of the particles are updated based on the
likelihood functionp(:) of the measurementy
t
given the pre-
dicted statesx
i
t
. The measurement model takes into account
the variation between the difference in water depth measured
at the particles’ predicted locations (with measurement noise
from section II-B) and the true difference in water depth
measured by the vehicle. The smaller the difference, the
higher the weight that is assigned to the particular particle.

where the subscript y

i
t:t 1
refers to the difference in position
of particle i at time t 1 and at the current time t.
B. Multiple-vehicles with Acoustic Communication
Fitted with an acoustic modem, the vehicles are able
to communicate and share information with other vehicles
within their communication range. The vehicles in the team
are assumed to have their system time synchronized. A sim-
ple round-robin scheduling is adopted such that each vehicle
in the team, termed a Peer Vehicle (PV), broadcasts its local
state information sequentially using acoustic communication.
This information includes the vehicle’s current position esti-
mate, ^ x
PV
t
, its ﬁlter’s estimated covariance matrix,P
PV
t
, and
the latest water depth measurement,y
PV
t
. When the acoustic
signal is received by another vehicle, termed a Receiving
Vehicle (RV), the time-of-arrival (TOA) can be calculated
to determine the inter-vehicle distance,R. The measurement
noise ofR is not considered here, and is being addressed in
our current work.
Since none of the vehicles in the team is equipped with
high accuracy navigational sensors, the information received
cannot be used directly to inﬂuence the measurement model
presented in [24], as the PV may have accumulated signiﬁ-
cant error by the time the information is broadcast. Instead,
the information from PV inﬂuences RV’s particle distribu-
tion, and affects the corresponding weight computation in
two separate stages:
1) Introduction of auxiliary particle set: A set of M
auxiliary particles is added to the RV’s original particle pool.
These particles are randomly distributed within the boundary
of the PV’s error covariance, and the mean of the distribution
is along a straight line between PV and RV at a distance
R away from the PV , as illustrated in Fig. 3. The resultant
N+M particles then are weighted using the same likelihood
function (10) as other particles. Intuitively, the introduction
of the auxiliary particles modiﬁes the distribution through the
inter-vehicle constraints from ranging. The new distribution
has the potential to alleviate divergence when the vehicle
navigates over a ﬂat terrain, until it enters another area that
has more terrain variability.
2) Utilizing PV’s water depth measurement: Given R,
y
PV
t
and P
PV
t
, we assume that the probability of an RV
particle representing the vehicle’s true position is directly
proportional to the probability of measuring y
PV
t
within
the ellipse described by the P
PV
t
, and at a distance of
R away from the particle’s current position. For each of
the N + M particles p
i
resulting from section III-B.1, a
new set of particles, p
int
, is randomly generated along the
arc formed by the intersection of a circle having radius R
and centered at p
i
, with P
PV
t
. The average likelihood of
p
int
evaluated against y
PV

contributes to the likelihood

. This assumption makes use of PV’s water depth
measurement as well as the derived ranging information to
further inﬂuence the local particles’ distribution. This second
stage likelihood evaluation is further illustrated in Fig. 4.
As a result, the particle’s likelihood evaluation consists
of an extra likelihood function whenever there is acoustic

IV. SIMULATION TESTING SETUP AND RESULTS
Numerical experiments are conducted to assess the perfor-
mance of these ﬁlters using bathymetric maps for two areas
with distinct terrains. The ﬁrst map is from waters near the
St. John’s Island, Singapore where depth varies from a few
meters to around 30 meters, as shown in Fig. 5. The second
map is from Charles River Basin, Boston (Fig. 8) where
the terrain is ﬂatter and patchy. We evaluate the localization
performance using different numbers of vehicles, with and
without acoustic communication, and under the inﬂuence of
a simulated steady ocean current. The parameters shown in
Table I are kept the same throughout all the runs, while
the process and measurement noises are assumed Gaussian
independent and drawn randomly at every propagation and

A. Simulation using St. John’s Island bathymetry map
Fig. 5(a) shows the planned paths of ﬁve vehicles per-
forming lawn-mowing surveying missions near the island.
Assuming simple dead-reckoning, under the inﬂuence of
a southward ocean current the resulting trajectories of the
vehicles are shown in Fig. 5(b). From the simulated vehicle
paths, depth measurements were drawn. Using the particle
ﬁlter, these measurements were combined with control inputs
for the planned paths, to generate estimated tracks. The
objective of the ﬁlter is to minimize the error between the
estimated tracks and the simulated paths, and to correctly
estimate the ocean current model.

values.
In Fig. 6(a), we present position estimation errors averaged
over all the vehicles in the team. Bathymetric-based local-
ization is dramatically improved by acoustic communication;
without information sharing between the vehicles, the ﬁlter
fails to converge and position errors grow rapidly. The ﬁlters
in each vehicle also reasonably track the ocean current
model, as shown in Fig. 6(b). Since the vehicles are not
equipped with any exteroceptive sensors, the accuracy of
current estimation is important to the vehicle’s navigational
performance.
We varied the number of participating vehicles in the
localization from two to ﬁve, while other parameters shown
in Table I were held ﬁxed. In Fig. 7 we see that the
localization performance improves as the number of the
vehicles in the team is increased, at least up to four. For
a larger number of vehicles, the round-robin communication
strategy lengthens the cycle time; longer update periods are
a handicap to any ﬁlter.
The duration of an individual transmission’s time slot is
governed by propagation delay and other effects, so that
generally one requires several seconds minimum [25]. We
repeated the simulation runs with individual ranging intervals
varying from 9 to 30 seconds; estimation errors increase
slightly with time, but the trend is not signiﬁcant.
B. Hybrid experiment using autonomous surface vehicle in
Charles River Basin
The second set of tests was performed using a bathymetry
map of the Charles River Basin, with altimeter measurements
obtained from an autonomous surface vehicle (ASV). The
ASV is ﬁtted with a Tritech-PA500 single-beam altimeter,
providing one-millimeter resolution when it operates in digi-
tal mode. Using the same parameters mentioned in Table I, a
total of three lawn-mowing paths similar to those of Fig. 5(a)
were planned. Under the inﬂuence of the simulated ocean

beam altimeter.
current, we deformed the paths as for the St. John Island’s
case. The ASV was commanded to follow these three paths
using high-precision RTK GPS as a ground truth, while
collecting depth data. The resultant trajectories are shown
in Fig. 8. The oscillating patterns on the trajectories were
due to the surface waves and the ASV’s onboard control
system, which were not modeled in the ﬁlter.
Again, with the control input to the ﬁlter’s process model
derived from the planned paths, we carried out collaborative
localization using the depth data as if it had been obtained by
three separate vehicles. An acoustic communication packet
broadcasting success rate of 75% [26] was simulated be-
tween the vehicles to emulate the acoustic channel’s typical
performance within this environment. Fig. 9 shows the
average position and current bias errors accumulated by the
vehicles. With only three vehicles in the team and a 25%
packet loss rate, as well as the “unmodeled dynamic” caused
by the vehicle’s control system, the individual ﬁlters still
managed to keep the errors around ten meters. As before,
without acoustic communication, the ﬁlters failed to track
the vehicles and to identify the current bias.
Errors in the second case (Fig. 9) are worse than in the
ﬁrst (Fig. 6). Besides the communication losses and control
disturbances in the second case, there is a smaller number
of vehicles, reducing the number of available constraints.
A third factor is the quality of the map: St John’s Island
bathymetry was derived from high-resolution multi-beam
sonar and INS, while the Charles River map was constructed
by interpolating altimeter measurements that were collected
separately by the ASV running a lawn-mowing pattern, with
paths separated by ﬁve meters.
The assumption of 0.01 meters for the standard deviation
of measurement noise may be too tight in some cases,
especially for AUVs operating in deeper water. Fig. 10
shows the distribution of position estimation errors when the
altimeter measurements are corrupted at higher noise levels.
The collaborative ﬁlter is apparently robust up to 0.3 meters,
with a graceful degradation of performance above that level.

Other factors like the depth sensor’s sampling frequency
and terrain variability also affect the ﬁlter’s localization
performance, and will need to be considered in more detail.
Overall, the simulation results presented so far conﬁrm the
crucial role of acoustic communication in aiding sensor-
limited AUVs in performance collaborative localization.
V. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we have showed that it is feasible for a team
of AUVs, each equipped with only a single-beam altimeter, a
depth sensor, and an acoustic modem, to perform collabora-
tive localization. In particular, we employed the Marginalized
Particle Filter at each vehicle, and incorporated the informa-
tion broadcast by other vehicles into each vehicle’s local
ﬁlter. We showed that the inter-vehicle communication is
crucial for this capability, and that increasing the number
2480
of AUVs helps to improve the localization performance to a
point. The resulting collaborative localization algorithm was
also shown to be robust in handling higher levels of sensor
noise and an unreliable communication channel.
