Abstract— In this paper, we generalize our random matrix
based (RM-based) uncertainty model for manipulator Jacobian
matrix to the dynamic model of the robotic systems. Conven-
tional random variable based (RV-based) schemes require a
detailed knowledge of the system parameters variation and may
be not able to fully characterize the uncertainties of the complex
dynamic systems. However, the proposed RM-based approach
provides a probabilistic framework for systematic characteri-
zation of the uncertainties in the complex systems with limited
available information. Moreover, RM-based uncertainty model
is an efﬁcient mathematical tool that ensures the kinematic and
dynamic consistency and takes into account the system com-
plexity, conﬁguration, structural inter-dependencies, etc. The
application of the RM-based uncertainty model is investigated
using an example of kinematically redundant planar parallel
manipulator (3-(P)RRR). The simulation results are compared
with those obtained through conventional RV-based approach
and the effectiveness of the proposed method is discussed.
I. INTRODUCTION
The topic of uncertainties in the stochastic dynamic sys-
tems has been widely investigated over the past decades
especially with the focus on the estimation and control
problems. However, techniques that address the uncertainty
characterization and subsequently design of the systems with
lower level of the uncertainties (or, in the other words, less
sensitive to the uncertainties) have not received as much
attention. In a general classiﬁcation, the system uncertainties
can be categorized into aleatory and epistemic [1]. The
former, as the name suggests, includes inherent and irre-
ducible variations of the system and its environment, on
which the designer does not have any control. However,
the latter includes the reducible uncertainties that are caused
by lack of the system knowledge (and can be suppressed
by increasing the state of the knowledge and collection of
more data) [2], [3]. Epistemic uncertainties can be further
categorized into model, phenomenological and behavioral
uncertainties [2], of these, model uncertainties are induced
by simpliﬁcation in the construction of mathematical model
that represents actual physical process. The phenomenolog-
ical uncertainties are induced by the design techniques and
strategies and behavioral uncertainties are associated with
the human decision variations. Our goal is to capture the
model and phenomenological uncertainties in a systematic
manner. This is critical since the design methodology may

actually produce the uncertainties (or magnify the effect of
other variations) during system operation.
In complex dynamic systems, several parameters may be
uncertain and vary over the operation time, representing
stochastic processes. For example, in robotic manipulators,
mass of the different parts, effective length of the links,
position of the bases, etc. can be assumed as random vari-
ables at every time point, that induce disturbing (uncertain)
forces (external disturbing forces are treated separately).
Time varying masses, (e.g., moving platform carrying a time
varying mass), deﬂection and bending of the links at different
conﬁgurations, ﬂexibilities at the joints and bases of the
manipulators, clearances, imperfections, etc. can cause these
ﬂuctuations. However, information about the variation of all
random parameters and their correlations are not known for
several complex systems.
These facts necessitate a probabilistic framework that
enables the uncertainty characterization in such systems
that subsequently facilitates the design of systems with less
ﬂuctuations while in operation. Key requirements for an
appropriate uncertainty characterization model for the robotic
systems include taking into account:
 Kinematic and dynamic consistency, entire system
complexity, structural inter-dependencies and inter-
correlations.
 State of the system.
 System conﬁgurations, e.g., close to the singularity
conﬁgurations in manipulator systems.
 Limited available information on the system ﬂuctua-
tions.
 Computational efﬁciency.
In this paper, we generalize our RM-based uncertainty
model for manipulator Jacobian matrix, developed in [4],
[5], that is based on the non-parametric probabilistic model
proposed by Soize [6], [7], to dynamic equations of motion
(EOM) of the robotic systems. This provides a systematic
approach that adequately satisﬁes the requirements noted
above and can be beneﬁcial in the design procedure of the
complex dynamic systems (from the uncertainty perspective).
The system matrices (inertial mass, Coriolis & centripetal
and input transformation) are considered as random matrices
and using the maximum entropy principle an appropriate
probability model is constructed,i.e., a matrix-variate density
function is derived.
The remainder of this paper is structured as follows.
Section II concerns the derivation of the random matrix
formulation of the dynamic system matrices. Section III
describes the dynamic EOM of a kinematically redundant
planar parallel manipulator that is used as a case study for

the developed method. The simulations and results based on
the conventional random variable scheme and the approach
proposed in this paper are presented and compared in sec-
tion IV. A brief discussion and directions of the future work
are provided in the last section.
II. RANDOM MATRIX FORMULATION
In this section, our random matrix formulation of the ma-
nipulator Jacobian matrix developed in [4], [5] is generalized
to dynamic EOM of the robotic systems. The EOM of the
deterministic mean dynamic system can be expressed as:
M(q) ¨ q+ C(q; ˙ q) ˙ q+ N(q)= E(q)t (1)
in which under-bar represents the mean value that will be
deﬁned shortly, q=[q
1
q

::: q
n
]
T
is the system state vector,
M(q)2M
+
n
is inertial mass matrix (M
+
n
denotes the space of
nn symmetric positive deﬁnite matrices), C(q; ˙ q)2M
n
is
the Coriolis and centripetal matrix (M
n
denotes the space
of real nn matrices), N(q)2R
n1
is the gravitational
force vector, E(q)2M
n
is the input transformation matrix
and t2R
n1
is the input to the system. As motivated in
the preceding section, we model the uncertainties in the
system through formulation of the system matrices as random
matrices. The stochastic counterpart of the deterministic
mean system described in Eq. (1) can be written as:
M ¨ q+ C ˙ q+ N= Et (2)
In Eq. (1) and (2) and forthcoming equations, capital
letters are used for matrix notation and bold letters indicate
the random vector or matrix. Note that the system matrices
are nonlinear functions of the system state (q). So, let us
make the following assumption.
Assumption 1: The state of the system at each time
point, q
k
, can be accurately observed, however due to the
uncertainties, the state at the subsequent time point q
k+1
is
random.
Now, let us assume a general symmetric and positive
deﬁnite random matrix A. The main goal is to construct a
probability model for A, i.e., deriving an appropriate matrix-
variate probability density function p
A
(A) : M
+
n
!R. The
ﬁrst step in the construction of the probability model is
to identify the constraints and available information on the
random matrix. Each valid density function has to satisfy the
normalization constraint expressed as:
Z
A2M
+
n
p
A
(A)dA= 1 (3)
In addition, we assume that the mean value of the random
matrix A, denoted by A, is given. So,
E[A]=
Z
A2M
+
n
Ap
A
(A)dA=A (4)
To ﬁnd p
A
(A), an information-theoretic approach is em-
ployed. In this approach, the density function is obtained
using maximum entropy principle proposed by Jaynes [8],
i.e., the entropy measure, initially introduced by Shannon [9],
is maximized subjected to the existing constraints. In fact,
maximizing the entropy measure of uncertainty helps to pick
from amongst the set of all admissible density functions (that
satisfy the prior information and constraints). This method
has been frequently used to obtain the density function of the
systems random variables e.g., Soize [6], [7], [10], Adhikari
[11] and Ghanem and Das [12] used the maximum entropy
method to derive the probability model of the structural
system matrices (mass, damping, stiffness and frequency
response function matrices). Das and Ghanem [13], [14]
further addressed this problem by incorporating additional
upper and lower bound constraints on the system matrices.
A similar approach is followed here to ﬁnd p
A
(A). Entropy
measure for density function p
A
(A) is deﬁned as:
S(p)= 

The Lagrangian multiplier method can be used to max-
imize S(p) subjected to the constraints in Eq. (3) and (4).
The Lagrangian functional is constructed as:

by Eq. (7) with the well-known matrix-variate Wishart dis-
tribution, given in Eq. (9), veriﬁes that the derived density
function p
A
(A) is a Wishart distribution. An nn random
symmetric positive deﬁnite matrix S is said to have a Wishart
distribution with parameters n, p and S2 M

SW(n;p;S), if its probability density function (pdf) is

Comparing Eq. (7) with Eq. (9) shows that A has a Wishart
distribution with parameters n, p=n+1 andS=

, i.e.,
AW(n;n+ 1;
A

).

While p
A
(A) is derived, more steps are required to fully
realize the ﬁnal proper density function for A. Eq. (3) and (4)
are the only constraints used in the Lagrangian formulation
(Eq. (6)). So, the resultant density function given in Eq. (7) is
maximally uncertain [11]. Existence of the inverse moments
is the additional constraint that we may utilize in the max-
imization of the entropy measure. Though A2M

n
implies
the existence of the A
 1
but it does not entail the existence of
the moments of A

. In fact, the inverse moment constraint
requires E[kA

F
is the Frobenius norm
and n > 1 is an integer denoting the order of the moment.
It is shown [6], [11] that this constraint can be equivalently
written as E[ln(det(A)
 n
)]<¥. Subsequently, the modiﬁed
Lagrangian functional is:

shows that AW(n;2n+n+ 1;
A
2n+n+ 1
).
In the maximum entropy formulation, depending on the
choice of the A or A
 1
the ﬁnal distribution can signiﬁcantly
change (informationdependence). To overcome this problem,
Adhikari [11], [16] further improved the obtained density
function p
A
(A) by so-called optimal Wishart distribution. In
his approach, it is required that E[A] and E[A
 1
] be closest
to the A and A
 1
, respectively. His derivation suggests (see
[11], [16] for the details of the derivation):
AW(n;n+ 1+g;
A
p
g(n+ 1+g)
) where g = 2n (12)
To facilitate the selection of a proper order of the inverse
moment (n), the normalized standard deviation of A, intro-
duced by Soize [6], is deﬁned as:

is called dispersion parameter and denotes the level of
the uncertainty of the random matrix A.
Now, in order to utilize the constructed probability model
in the simulation of the random dynamic system described
in Eq. (2), the following general matrix factorizations are
considered.
M= M

; C= C

An appropriate matrix factorization (e.g., Cholesky, QR,
LU, etc.) must be selected depending on the properties of the
corresponding random matrices (M, C and E) as symmetry,
positive deﬁniteness, etc. For example, Soize [6], [7] used
the Cholesky decomposition for the modeling of the positive
deﬁnite random matrices in the structural dynamic systems.
Now, from Eq. (16) and using Eq. (15), we can simply
conclude that E[A

where I

can be chosen based on the experience or
experimental measurements.
III. KINEMATICALLY REDUNDANT PARALLEL
MANIPULATOR
Parallel manipulators provide several advantages com-
pared to their serial counterparts. These advantages include
higher stiffness, higher accuracy, higher stability, higher
payload to weight ratio, etc. However, smaller workspace,
several singularity regions within their workspace and com-
plexity of the kinematic/dynamic models are some major
drawbacks associated with them. Recently, researchers have
studied the kinematics and dynamics of the redundant planar
parallel manipulators whose (non-redundant) basis topology
is 3-RRR (underline denotes the actuated joint) parallel ma-
nipulator. For example, Ebrahimi et al. [17] introduced a 3-
(PR)RR redundant manipulator in which a prismatic actuator
is added to all three limbs of the base manipulator. They
investigated the kinematics, workspace and the singularities
of the proposed 3-(PR)RR manipulator. In addition Kotlarski
et al. [18] proposed a 3-(P)RRR manipulator, in which the
prismatic actuator is added to only one limb for singularity
elimination and enlarging the workspace, and its dynamic
identiﬁcation was performed in another effort by Thanh et
al. [19].
In this section, we review the dynamic formulation of the
3-(P)RRR redundant planar parallel manipulator [19], shown
in Fig. 1. The loop-closure constraints for each serial limb
of the mechanism at the platform pivots are given by:

systems.
IV. SIMULATIONS AND RESULTS
To investigate the effectiveness of the proposed uncer-
tainty model, in this section we perform Monte Carlo (MC)
simulations based on both conventional random variable
scheme and the developed random matrix method. While
Fig. 1: 3-(P)RRR redundant planar parallel manipulator [19].
in RV-based approach, several random parameters are inde-
pendently sampled and substituted in nonlinear relations at
every time point, the RM-based simulation will only use a
scalar dispersion parameter to generate the sample of the
dynamic system matrices. As discussed above, this is very
beneﬁcial in the complex robotic systems in which limited
information is available on the detailed ﬂuctuation of the
system parameters. In addition, in the real systems, the
random system parameters may be not actually independent,
that will increase the complexity of the sample generation in
RV-based MC analysis. Moreover, in RM-based approach,
sampling the system random matrices (instead of random
parameters) at every time point alleviates the need of solving
several nonlinear equations. In RV-based method, one may
sample the elements of system matrices independently to
avoid solution of these nonlinear equations, however, the re-
sultant sample of the random matrix may be not dynamically
consistent. For example, the sample of the mass matrix may
be not positive deﬁnite. Furthermore, samples in RM-based
analysis are drawn from well-known Wishart distribution for
which efﬁcient and accurate sampling algorithms have been
developed (see for example [12]). MATLAB also provides
the built-in function wishrnd for sampling from Wishart
distribution. This will further facilitates the RM-based MC
analysis. Despite of these advantages, there exist a question
of correctness of RM-based method that will be addressed
in the following subsections.

are summarized in Tab. I.
Following this procedure, 500 simulations are performed
for t2[0; 6] s (with time step size Dt = 0:005 s) and the
realizations of the system response (x
E
, y
E
and f
E
) are ob-
tained for statistical analysis. In addition, to perform a similar
analysis with nearly the same level of uncertainty in the
RM-based approach, we obtained the dispersion parameters
of the system matrices (using their samples constructed by
substituting the samples of the system random parameters)
at different time points using Eq. (13). Fig. 3 shows the time
evolution of the dispersion parameters corresponding to
˜
M,
˜
C and
˜
E.
2) RM-based MC Analysis: Using the dispersion parame-
ters (the only information needed for RM-based method),
obtained as described in section IV-B.1, we are able to
perform RM-based MC analysis (with approximately the
same level of uncertainty) as follows. At each time point,
the mean matrices are calculated by substituting the nomi-
nal values of the parameters and accurately observed state
(assumption 1). Subsequently, obtained mean matrices are
decomposed using a proper matrix factorization (Eq. (15)).
Here, we use Cholesky decomposition for mass matrix, and
LU decomposition for Coriolis and transformation matrices.
Then, using the constructed probability model, samples of
the perturbation matrices are drawn from optimal Wishart
distribution using Eq. (12) and (14). Substituting the samples
in Eq. (16) generates a sample of the
˜
M,
˜
C and
˜
E at the
corresponding time point and the system is solved for the
subsequent time step toward the end of the simulation time.
Using this procedure, we performed 500 MC simulations
and, similar to the RV-based analysis, the realizations of x
E
,
y
E
and f
E
are obtained for the statistical analysis.
3) Comparison: Fig. 4 shows the mean and STD of
the EE position and orientation error (denoted by e
X
and
e
f
, respectively) versus the time for both RV-based and
RM-based analyses. From the realizations of the x

From Fig. 4, it can be seen that RM-based results are in
good agreement with those obtained from RV-based analysis.
The mean position and orientation errors corresponding to
RM-based analysis (dotted red lines) are closely following
the mean error trajectories obtained from RV-based method
(solid black lines). Fig. 4 also shows that in both position
and orientation error cases, the RM-based STD trajectory
has similar trend (over the simulation time) to that of the
RV-based approach. The STD of EE position error obtained
from RM-based analysis is only slightly higher than the
STD corresponding to RV-based method. This difference is
relatively more for orientation error. As noted above, there
are some unknown (and unmodeled) uncertainties that are
taken into account by RM-based approach. For example,
perturbing the random parameters does not perturb the zero
components in the system matrices, i.e., does not include
any variation due to unmodeled coupling in the system,
while perturbation of the random matrices incorporates such
coupling effects. This can result in higher level of variations
in the system response.
V. DISCUSSION
In this paper, we generalized our RM-based probability
model of the manipulator Jacobian matrix [4], [5], that
is based on the non-parametric probabilistic formulation
proposed by Soize [6], [7], to the dynamic equations of
motion (EOM) of the robotic systems. The main objective is
to provide a systematic approach in a probabilistic framework
for the uncertainty characterization in complex dynamic sys-
tems. Conventional RV-based approaches are unable to fully

Fig. 4: Mean and STD of the EE position and orientation
errors corresponding to RV-based and RM-based approaches
characterize the uncertainties for several complex systems
due to the structural inter-dependencies and correlations,
couplings, unknown modeling errors and generally limited
available information on the uncertainties in these systems.
However, the RM-based approach provides an appropriate
tool for quantiﬁcation of the uncertainties that is well-suited
for complex robotic systems. The constructed probability
model only requires a scalar dispersion parameter that can be
obtained based on the experience or from the experiments.
In addition, it adequately satisﬁes some requirements of
an appropriate probability model for robotic systems, as
accounting for the system state and conﬁguration (e.g., close
to singularity regions), computational efﬁciency, etc. To
examine the proposed method, we performed MC analysis
on the dynamic model of a kinematically redundant parallel
manipulator, based on the conventional random variable and
proposed random matrix approaches and the results were
compared to highlight the effectiveness of the developed
method. It was shown that the results obtained from RM-
based approach closely follow those obtained from RV-based
analysis.
While we investigated the applicability of the proposed
RM-based uncertainty model, however, more general conclu-
sions can be drawn when the simulation results are compared
to the experimental data. This will hopefully be included in
our future studies.
