AbstractÑHow to design a robotic hand reflecting human 
hand motion information as much as possible is a constantly 
exploring problem. In this paper, we propose an approach to 
mechanical design of compliant underactuated finger for 
prosthetic hand based on the decomposition of human hand 
movements. Hand movements are decomposed into primary 
and secondary motion in PCA coordinate system. The primary 
motion is achieved in free motion via actuators, and the 
secondary motion is implemented with mechanical compliance 
matching statistics characteristic of human motion data. 
Although analysis and design of single finger is always 
throughout this paper, the same method can be generalized to 
the whole hand design and the parameters design of other 
mechanical configuration. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
One of the challenging problems in robotics is implement- 
tation of human-like movements in unstructured human 
environment. It is difficult to replicate the function of human 
hand, because of the complicated anatomical structure and 
mysterious neuromuscular control system. One approach to 
reduce this complexity is through synergy, which is from 
neuroscience and shows that a continuous subspace of 
configuration space can be used to approximate everyday 
human hand tasks.  
Santello et al. [1] investigated grasping poses from mime 
grasps for a large set of familiar objects via principal 
components analysis (PCA) and revealed that more than 80% 
of hand posture information is contained in the Þrst two 
principal components, which shows that the grasping posture 
can be expressed as a much lower-dimensional subspace of the 
hand joint space and reflects signiÞcant joint coupling and 
inter-Þnger coordination. A similar rule about hand motion 
during grasping was discovered in subsequent research [2].  
Human hand synergy provides a natural modeling 
paradigm for robotics. Ciocarlie and Allen [3] used the idea to 
exploit the dimensionality reduction in problems of automated 
grasp synthesis, and has been applied effectively to derive 
pre-grasp shapes for a number of complex robotic hands. 
Brown and Asada [4] designed a mechanical hand in which 
more or less accurate actuators are connected to different 
groups of mechanically interconnected joints, with a priority

inspired by resemblance to postural synergies observed in 
human hands.  
Brown and Asada [4] designed the mechanical hand to 
replicate the lower-order synergies and ignore higher-order 
principal components. Introducing a model of compliance in 
rigid-body system to solve force indeterminacies, Bicchi et al. 
[5, 6] did not give the method to design parameters but showed 
quality of grasp is quite robust with respect to parameter 
values. The synergy approach to the mechanical design of 
anthropopathic hand can greatly reduce the number of 
actuators and simplify the control strategy, but it also brings 
new issues. The postural synergies, i.e. the first few principal 
components, account for vast majority of hand posture 
information. However, even though they are small, 
higher-order principal components do not represent random 
variability but instead provide additional information about 
the object [2]. How to design anthropopathic hands to retain 
high-order information while implementing the principal 
motion is a difficult problem.  
In this paper, the approach to embed human hand 
movement information into robotic hand mechanism is studied. 
In contrast to the grasp measure of hand such as force 
distribution, force-closure [5] and robust [7], we are interested 
in the motion of robotic hand imitating human hand. In 
particular, we examine the motion characteristics of index 
finger and implement it in mechanic finger. In different grasp 
patterns (such as power, precision, lateral, etc.), there are 
significant independence between and among each finger, and 
the single finger is allowed visual representation and detailed 
analysis, which is difficult for the whole hand with more than 
twenty DOFs [8] [9].  
In the work presented in this paper, we extract human 
finger movement characteristics with PCA and analyze the 
finger movement behavior in PCA coordinate system, which 
is emulated using tendon-pulley mechanism. Then, 
compliance substituted for higher-order principal motions, we 
propose a quantitative method of mechanical implementing 
anthropomorphic posture synergy and compliance, and 
accordingly present a novel anthropopathic fingers which can 
be embedded in prosthetic hands. 
II. HUMAN FINGER MOVEMENTS 
We hope to provide methodological guidance for 
prosthetic hand design through analysis of human hand 
motion data. Therefore, the three-joints finger, easy to 
visualized analysis, will be analyzed as an example to elicit 
our design ideas. 
A.  Acquisition of human movement data

trajectories to move the Þngers from one location in space to

another. It is this ability that makes the hand so valuable in 
many daily tasks, especially grasp and manipulation. Attempts 
to formalize human tendency to simplify the space of possible 
grasps can be traced back to NapierÕs pioneering grasp 
taxonomy [10], which would divide grasps into power and 
precision grasps. In studying the grasps required for 
manufacturing tasks, Cutkosky showed a grasp hierarchy 
which offers a classiÞcation scheme for typical human grasps 
[11]. In [12], Fiex reviewed a large Þeld of work on grasp 
taxonomies and provided a much more comprehensive and 
detailed organization of human grasps. Grasp types divided 
elaborately more and more are not equally important, some 
grasp often used in our daily life, and some not so. An 
investigation of the frequency of use of various grasp types in 
daily activities is presented in [13]. The average durations and 
frequencies for the top 10 grasps, which account for 
approximately 80% percent of the total grasp duration [14]. 
An optimal grasp set which can effectively handle as many 
different objects as possible was picked with the grasp span 
metric [15].  
Synthesize the frequencies [14] and the grasp span metric 
[15], we choice 8 grasp types in Fiex grasp taxonomy 
involving the three main clusters, i.e. power, intermediate and 
precision grasps, as Fig. 1.

We measured the angles at the metacarpalphalangeal 
(MCP), proximal interphalangeal (PIP) and distal 
interphalangeal (DIP) joints of the four Þngers. Flexion was 
deÞned as positive; the joint angles were deÞned as 0¡ when 
the Þnger was straight and in the plane of the palm. Using a 
Cyberglove, we collected joint angle reach-to-grasp data on 8 
different grasps. After normalizing the duration of each 
movement, we analyzed the hand postures during this interval 
using PCA.

where D is a diagonal matrix and P is a matrix of eigenvectors 
of S arranged as columns. The eigenvectors

of constant density ellipsoid spindle, and the eigenvalues 
ii
d is 
squared length of corresponding spindle. The data distribution 
characteristics of index finger joints can be expressed as Fig 2, 
where the blue point cloud is the joint angle sampling data. 
The second and third principal components (PCs) are far 
less than the first PC, PC1> 85%. Three principal components 
in the movement direction are projected in Cartesian space as 
shown in Fig 3. Whether in joint space or in Cartesian space, it 
is obvious that the direction of the first PC is the main 
direction of movement, reflecting the general trend of finger 
movement, and the second and third PCs reflect the deviation 
degree from the main direction of movement in different 
directions.  
To provide a vivid performance for the linear motion 
feature of the three PCs, a finger is designed with 
tendon-pulley transmission mechanism shown in Fig. 4. Three 
groups of pulleys are independently driven by three motors, 
and the radius ratio of each set pulleys equal to the proportions 
among corresponding elements of eigenvector. Then the three 
PCs of finger movement can be achieved separately by the 
three motors. Motor 1 synchronous bend three joints 
proportionally to achieve the first PC movement; motor 2 led

2
q reverse movement and

q conjugate 
movement, to achieve the second PC movement; motor 3 drive 
2
q and 
3
q reverse movement, but donÕt drive 
1
q , to achieve 
the third component.  
In the data analysis, we found that the first element of PC3 
is very close to zero. In other words, the plane spanned by PC1 
and PC2, bearing 98% of the motion information, parallel to 
1
q axis of the original coordinates. Therefore, with the two 
motor driving a finger, the coupling of 
2
q and 
3
q statistically 
meet the human hand law of motion. However, it is still too 
much for each finger flexion and extension movements of the 
practical robot hand by the two motors. Here we will introduce 
a mechanical implementation approach to achieve finger 
anthropomorphic movement with a single motor.

III. MECHANICAL IMPLEMENTATION 
Previously, the characteristics of human finger movement 
data are extracted via PCA; and the finger mechanism is 
designed to achieve the PCs movement. We will reduce 
motors to one, while preserving more information in the finger 
mechanism. 
A. Compliance embed 
In three separate motors , motor 1 drives the first PC 
movement, is primary motion and will be reserved, while 
motors 2 and 3 drive movements in the plane spanned by PC2 
and PC3 regulating gestures to achieve the different objects 
crawl, is secondary motion. We use mechanical compliance 
instead of motors 2 and 3 to achieve secondary motion. The 
most direct approach is to replace the motor with elastic 
elements, and the elastic element parameters reflecting the 
distribution of motion data.  The original intention is that the 
mechanical compliance, which reflects how easily to motion 
in response to the same applied force, corresponds to the 
discrete level of movement data.

Fig. 5. Single-actuator PCA finger embedded mechanical compliance. 
The movement ability along direction of PC2 and PC3 is 
different, manifested statistically as different variance along 
different directions. In the finger embedding elastic element in 
Fig. 5, the movement ability along the direction of PC2 and 
PC3 is showed as compliance, i.e. reciprocal of the rigidity. 
Therefore, compliance of mechanism is proportional to the 
variance of the motion data along PC2 and PC3 direction to 
achieve the movement ability matching, expressed as

The relative value of elastic elements is given in (3), while 
their absolute sizes are associated with the other indicators of 
the finger, such as the performance of drive and the grasping 
force etc, which are also very important issues but not 
emphasis of this study.  
B. Mechanical compliance matching to PCA 
The aforementioned design methodology can be 
summarized in two steps: first, the lower-order principal 
components movement information of human hand is 
achieved through actuators; second, the higher-order principal 
components movement is achieved through the method of 
405
  
mechanical compliance. In the second step, this design 
thought is essentially matching compliant ellipsoid of robotic 
hand mechanism and constant density ellipsoid of human 
motion data in the subspace of secondary motion.

directions under the action of external force.  
We decouple stiffness matrix in PCA coordinate system to 
achieve compliance ellipsoid and constant density ellipsoid 
matching.

the compliance between primary movement subspace and 
secondary movement subspace is decoupled. 
Condition 1 is the basic requirement to realize compliance 
matching, guaranteeing mechanical compliance matching the 
sports statistics in secondary movement subspace, showed as 
Fig. 7(a). Condition 2 can achieve mechanical compliance 
decoupling primary and secondary motion. It is the best case 
to meet Condition 1 and 2 simultaneously? showed in Fig. 7(b), 
where 
p
M is a block diagonal matrix and the elastic elements 
serial to actuators do not influence mechanical compliance 
matching to high-order PCs, such as PCA finger showed in 
Fig. 5.  
p
M
 is ignored for strictly movement refactoring, but it is 
better that 
p
M
 is full rank especially in the condition of  the 
low precision of the control and sensor, which is equivalent to 
the compliance of actuators.  
The above conditions can be used as the design criterion 
for compliant underactuated hands, which will be used in the 
design of parameters soon afterwards. 
C. Simplify to implement 
The finger model in Fig. 5 meets above two conditions, but 
embedded in humanoid robot hand using conventional 
manufacturing technology is a difficult problem. We simplify 
the mechanical structure to implant into the artificial limb.

A view of the latest-design finger prototype is presented 
In Fig. 10(a), whose basic size is 18mm?14mm?106mm

IV. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORKS 
Abundant human hand grasping behavior can be 
decoupled in the PCA coordinate system, significantly 
distinguishing the primary and secondary direction of 
movements. The statistics characteristic of human finger 
motion data can be more intuitively reflect this primary and 
secondary laws of motion via visualizations, and then guide 
the mechanical design of humanoid hand.

Primary movement reflects the overall finger movement,  
achieved through actively driven by acuators; the secondary 
movement information is implicated in the mechanical 
compliance, without loss of statistical information of human 
hand motion while decreasing controlling complexity and 
manufacturing costs of robotics hand. 
The novel finger mechanism presented in the paper goes 
ahead free movement without overcoming the resistance of the 
elastic element, and is arranged the smallest elastic restraint. 
The mechanical behavior and  grasp ability of the mechanism 
can be explored further. 
For the mechanical reproduction of human hand grasping 
behavior, we propose the mechanical compliance matching 
method which has certain universality and  will be extended to 
parameter design of compliance underactuated hands.
