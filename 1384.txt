Abstract—This paper addresses the area surveillance prob-
lem with a team of multiple aerial robots under communication
constraints. In previous work of authors [1], a decentralized
modular architecture was proposed for surveillance missions
with a team of homogeneous robots. This paper presents a
decentralized decision-making algorithm that solves the prob-
lem for heterogeneous aerial robots with different sensing and
motion capabilities. The proposed frequency-based approach
offers a dynamic and robust solution able to adapt to changes
in the area size and robot capabilities, and even to total robot
failures. The algorithm can run properly under communication

tions and experimental results validate the proposed system for
heterogeneous robots that can be dynamically added/removed
during the execution of the mission.
I. INTRODUCTION
The application of multi-UA V systems allows users to
accomplish a broad spectrum of missions with robustness
against failures, higher spatial coverage and an efﬁcient
deployment [2], [3], [4]. In particular, the beneﬁts of systems
with multiple aerial robots are clear for area surveillance or
monitoring missions in general [5], [6], [7]. Assuming robots
with different capabilities, the area monitoring problem can
be addressed as a task allocation problem where each robot
assumes a task related to its capabilities [8], [9]. Therefore,
the area monitoring mission can be divided in sub-area
monitoring tasks assigned to the robots depending on their
capabilities. This is equivalent to a partitioning patrolling
strategy.
Either when the areas to monitor are very large or when
the robots have limited capabilities, the communication
constraints represent a challenge for the operation of a
multi-robot system [10]. When the connectivity between
the robots can not be guaranteed in a multi-robot system
because of communications,it would be assure that robots
can meet periodically (it is the idea of periodic connectivity
as was deﬁned in [11])Also, in long endurance missions,
the number of robots accomplishing the mission can change
along time and the system should adapt to these changes [1].
Hence, robust distributed decision-making and multi-robot
coordination capabilities are important issues in this these
types of missions.

As will be described in this paper, the strategy presented
converges to an area partitioning strategy in a distributed
manner. Furthermore, it guarantees that the robots get close
enough to exchange the minimum required information,
obtaining a dynamic and fault-tolerant solution using only
local information. As it will be described along the paper,
this strategy adds some features to previous work of the
authors and provides experimental validation using a team
of quadrotors.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section II
an overview of the literature related to the problem is
presented. Section III describes formally the area coverage
problem to be addressed. An area partitioning patrolling
strategy is proposed to solve the problem in Section IV.
Section V describes the modular architecture proposed to
implement that strategy in a distributed manner. Section VI
presents both simulations and real experiments with a team
of quadrotors used to validate the approach and to compare
it with a path partitioning strategy. Finally the conclusions
and future developments of Section VII close the paper.
II. RELATED WORK
Some authors address the multi-robot area monitoring
missions using team formation techniques. The approach is
similar to the area patrolling mission with a single robot with
larger coverage capabilities [12]. Two different and parallel
problems have to be solved: close paths planning for area
coverage and coordinated patrolling along the paths.
Coverage path planning algorithms generate an efﬁcient
path which ensures that every point in the area can be
monitored from (at least) one position along the path [13].
In the online coverage algorithms, the area to be covered is
unknown “a priori” and step-by-step the team has to discover
obstacles and compute their paths avoiding collisions [14].
On the other hand, ofﬂine algorithms assume a known map.
The Boustrophedon Cellular Decomposition [15] is one of
the most well known methods to obtain a coverage path.
This technique implies a previous area division in smaller
sub-areas that can be covered with a simple back and forth
motion. Another method which creates a spanning tree and
generates the coverage paths as the boundary around it can
be found in [16].
In patrolling tasks a path has to be covered many times.
Many authors have applied a frequency-based approach [17].
Reference [18] analyzes and compares the cyclic and par-
titioning strategies. A cyclic strategy with identical robots
under communication constraints is presented in [19]. A path
partitioning strategy is proposed for cooperative monitoring

missions in [20], [21]. Authors of [22] present a partitioning-
based strategy to monitor a set of positions with different
priorities and homogeneous robots.
Coordinating a ﬂeet of robots to accomplish a surveillance
mission in a distributed manner and assuming communica-
tion constraints is a challenging problem. References [23],
[24] apply the concept of coordination variables to ensure
cooperation in a perimeter surveillance mission. Authors
in [25] analyze how this technique allows to achieve consen-
sus between the robots in few iterations. On other hand, one-
to-one coordination with less memory storage requirements
is presented in [1] to solve area surveillance missions in a
distributed and decentralized manner assuming homogeneous
robots under communication constraints. The same problem
is solved in [10] by using also one-to-one coordination with
the drawback that the system can not adapt to changes in the
number of robots during the execution. A similar technique
is proposed in [26] to solve a perimeter surveillance task with
a team of video-cameras and asynchronous communication
between them.
III. PROBLEM STATEMENT
Let us consider an area S2R
2
with a surface A that has
to be patrolled by a team of aerial robotsfQ
1
;Q

;:::;Q
N
g
with different capabilities (see Fig. 1) and holonomic kine-
matics. The probability of detection is assumed uniform in
the whole area, so all the locations inside the area should be
monitored periodically. The information about any detected
event should be propagated to all the members of the team
even under limited communication.
At time t each robot Q
i
has a position p
i
(t)2R

, whose
projection onto the plane z = 0 is r
i

, and a speed
v
i
(t). The robot monitors a circular areaC

deﬁned by
its sensor coverage range c

(t) computed from the current
altitude z
i
(t) and ﬁeld of view angle 

coverage speed a
i
(t) deﬁnes the area monitored per second
and will be approximated as
a
i
(t) 2c
i
(t)v
i
(t): (1)
Then the capabilities of each aerial robot are deﬁned by
its maximum altitude z
max
i
, ﬁeld of view 
max

and speed
v
max
i
. The maximum altitude and ﬁeld of view deﬁne the
maximum coverage range c
max
i
, as well as the maximum
coverage speed a
max
i
is given by the maximum coverage
range and speed. Obviously it is just an approximation which
depends strongly on the area shape. On the other hand, a pair
of robots only can exchange information if they are within
their communication range R.
In the frequency-based approaches the usual parameter to
be optimized is the frequency of visits of any position of the
area. Maximizing it is equivalent to minimizing the elapsed
time since the last visit or refresh time T
r
.
A. Minimizing the elapsed time
Different frequency-based performance criteria can be ap-
plied for the elapsed time: uniform criteria, average criteria,
minimal maximum criteria, etc. In this paper, the average
and maximum elapsed time will be used as the metric for
the performance of the approach.
Theorem 1 The minimum maximal elapsed time in the
area coverage mission with multiple mobile robots is lower
bounded by
T =

Proof: The maximum area covered by a single robot
Q

in a period T can be lower bounded by
A

Assuming that the monitored area by any robot Q

does
not overlap the area covered by the rest of robots, the total
area monitored by the team in a period T can be computed
as

Then for any T

Corollary 1 The minimum average elapsed time is com-
puted as T/2 in the optimal case.
IV. PATROLLING STRATEGIES WITH MULTIPLE
AERIAL ROBOTS
Given a team of N robots, a cooperative area monitoring
mission can be solved by deﬁning a patrolling strategy. Many
authors propose a cyclic strategy for cooperative monitoring
missions [19]. In a cyclic strategy, the same closed path P
which covers the whole area is traveled by all the robots.
4736
According to the minimal maximum period criteria, the
optimal solution implies that the robots move in the same
direction and equally spaced along the path.
Another patrolling approach is the path partitioning strat-
egy [21] that also starts with the generation of a single path
P to cover the whole area S. Each robot Q
i
covers a non-
overlapping segment P
i
of the path with a length L
i
related
to its own maximum speed v
max
i
. As all the robots take the
same time to cover their own segments, neighbor robots can
meet to communicate and coordinate periodically in their
common segment endpoints (periodic connectivity).
The maximum and average refresh times as well as the
maximum latency are analyzed in [24] for both strategies.
In short, the cyclic strategy theoretically could reach the
minimum maximal refresh time deﬁned in (2) but only for
teams of homogeneous robots and assuming no communica-
tion constraints. On other hand, the path partitioning strategy
can adapt to heterogeneous robots and communication con-
straints but even under ideal conditions it can not reach the
optimal performance deﬁned in (2). Therefore, in this paper
an area partitioning strategy is proposed to overcome these
limitations.
A. Area partitioning and multiple paths generation
In this strategy, the maximum speed and the maximum
coverage range capabilities of the different robots are ex-
ploited to obtain an efﬁcient solution. The whole area S is
divided among the robots and each robot Q
i
has to cover
a non-overlapping sub-area S
i
with a surface A
i
related to
its own maximum coverage speed a
max
i
according to the
expression
A
i
=a
max

P
N
j=1
a

;8i = 1;:::;N : (5)
Each aerial robot generates its own cyclic path P
i
with
length L
i
to cover its own sub-area S
i
and moves along it
periodically with its maximum coverage speed v
max
i
. Any
robot takes the same time T

to cover its path
T

; (6)
so neighbor robots periodically reach positions within their
communication ranges where they can exchange information,
obtaining a theoretical periodic connectivity.
Applying the partitioning area strategy to the problem
deﬁned in Section III, the minimal maximum refresh time
along the area S can be computed as
T
max
r
=T
0
: (7)
Finally the maximum elapsed time since any event is
detected in the area by a robot till that information is shared
with the rest of the team (or latency T
L
) can be computed
as
T
L
 (N 1)T
0
: (8)
The adopted strategy exploits the different capabilities
of the robots (both maximum speed and sensing coverage
range). In ideal conditions, each robot can cover its own
assigned area with the shortest coverage path of length
L
i
=
Ai
2ci
and the minimum maximum refresh time deﬁned
by expression (2) could be theoretically reached.
V. DECENTRALIZED DECISION-MAKING
ALGORITHM
In previous work [1] of the authors, it was proposed
a decentralized modular architecture for area surveillance
missions with a team of homogeneous robots. The obtained
solution converged to the area partitioning strategy described
in the Sect. IV-A in a distributed and decentralized manner.
From local decisions, the whole team obtains a coordinated
and efﬁcient strategy to monitor a whole area.
A modiﬁed version, assuming different decision-making
and coverage path planning algorithms, is presented here to
solve the problem with heterogeneous aerial robots (different
sensing and motion capabilities). The proposed approach
offers a dynamic and robust solution able to adapt to changes
in the area size and robot capabilities, and even to robot
total failures. The algorithm can run under communication
constraints and there is no robot which rules the others.
The decision-making process on-board each robot is based
on Algorithm 1. It is based only on its local information,
making the method scalable with the number of robots in
the team. As it will be shown later, the system converges to
the patrolling strategy described in Sect. IV-A following this
approach.
The aerial robots use a path planning algorithm based on
back and forth strategy that computes a closed path P
i
to
cover their assigned sub-areasS
i
according to their coverage
rangec
max
i
. Initially, the assigned sub-area is the whole area
S and the robots move along their own paths P
i
monitoring
the environment. When two robots are within their communi-
cation range, they exchange information about the sub-areas
they are covering info
i
= [S
i
;a
max
i
]. Each robot computes
the union of these sub-areas, divide it according to their
coverage speeds (a
max
i
;a
max
j
) and estimated path lengths,
and obtains the new sub-area to coverS
i
. Figure 2 illustrates
this one-to-one technique for rectangular sub-areas. A new
path P
i
is computed and the robot navigates following it.
That path includes a new meeting point between both robots
that is added to the list W
i
. If a robot arrives to a meeting
point and there is no communication with its neighbor, it
generates a path to cover the whole area S and continues
moving along it. Although the generated path depends on
the covering range of each robot, all the generated paths use
the same pattern (assuming rectangular areas), enabling but
not ensuring neighbors meeting even if some of them delays.
Moreover, it guarantees that the whole areaS is covered even
if several robots are lost.

Fig. 3: The maximum elapsed time since the last monitoring
task for all positions in the area is represented along the time,
for both the area division strategy and the path division strat-

orem 1) is shown. Videos from both simulations are avail-
able inhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePJHlgJPwrM and
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt5iQq984Tg
In the simulation, the blue robot leaves the mission at time
t = 2000 s and comes back later at timet = 4000 s. On the
other hand, an intruder is simulated in the position ( 8; 8)
m at time t = 6000 s. This location has been chosen far
from the area center to measure the maximum time to share
that information among all the team members. Figure 3
summarizes the simulation results for both the dividing path
and the dividing area strategies using the frequency-based
maximum elapsed time criteria.
The simulations show that the area division strategy has
better results than the path division strategy, comparing both
the minimal maximum and the average elapsed time metrics.
Also, the area division strategy allows the robots to converge
in the steady state to a solution close to the ideal case of
Theorem 1. Obviously, while the blue robot is out of the area
the results are worse for both strategies. However, the area
partitioning strategy adapts faster to change in the number
of available robots for the mission.
Figure 4 shows that after the intruder appears, it is detected
by a robot and the information about it is propagated to
all the team members. It can be seen that the area division
strategy offers a slightly faster information propagation per-
formance compared to the path division strategy.

B. Experimental tests
Real experiments to validate the proposed distributed sys-
tem have been carried out in the indoor testbed of the Spanish
Center for Advanced Aerospace Technologies (CATEC) in
Seville. The robots were a team of Hummingbird quadrotors
by Ascending Technologies with 200 g payload and up to 20
minutes of ﬂight autonomy. Their maximum ﬂight altitude
was ﬁxed by software to 2.5 meters.
The testbed uses a localization system based on 20 VICON
cameras and is able to offer the position and altitude of each
quadrotor with centimeter accuracy in real time.
The area to cover is a rectangular area of 99 m
2
in the
center of the testbed (see Fig. 5). A limited communication
range of 2 meters has been simulated by software using
the locations provided by the VICON system. The sensing
coverage range of the robots is 1.5 meters.
In the ﬁrst experiment, a team of two quadrotors has to
cover the whole area. It is assumed that one robot is faster
than the other one. Figure 6a shows that each robot covers an

of the different capabilities in an heterogeneous multi-robot
system. The ﬁrst robot (blue in Fig. 6a) has limited its
maximum speed to 0.35 m/s and the other one (red) can
move with a maximum speed of 0.45 m/s.
In the second experiment, a team of three quadrotors with
a maximum speed of 0.3 m/s covers the area. One of the
robots is lost at time t = 250 s and Fig. 6b shows how
the system can adapt the area distribution in a decentralized
manner dynamically.
VII. CONCLUSIONS
This paper has addressed the area surveillance problem
with a team of multiple aerial robots under communication
4739
constraints. A frequency-based approach has been proposed
to accomplish the missions using an area partitioning strategy
designed to minimize the refresh time. A simple analysis
showed that this technique offers better results than a cyclic
strategy: it can exploit the different capabilities of the robots
and keep periodical communication between them.
Furthermore, a decentralized decision-making algorithm
has been also presented. This algorithm computes a solution
that converges to the designed area partitioning strategy using
one-to-one coordination. Hence the system is scalable with
the number of robots and also allows to deal with dynamic
changes (robots added/removed during the execution).
Simulation and experimental results were used to validate
the proposed system and to compare it with the path par-
titioning strategy described in Sect. II. Simulations show a
better performance, obtaining close to optimal results for the
maximum refresh time. Other interesting features found in
the simulations and experiments were: decentralized conver-
gence to the proposed strategies, robustness against changes
in the number of robots, periodic interchange of information
and exploitation of the different robot capabilities.
Future developments will be oriented to address the cov-
erage problem considering priorities and adversarial settings.
