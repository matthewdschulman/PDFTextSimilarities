due to their advantageous properties, such as distal dexterity, 
design compactness, intrinsic compliance for safe interaction 
with unstructured environments. However, these manipulators 
sometimes suffer from the lack of enough stiffness while applied 
in surgical robotic systems. This paper presents an experimental 
kinestatic comparison between three continuum manipulators, 
aiming at revealing how structural variations could alter the 
manipulatorsÕ stiffness properties. These variations not only 
include modifying the arrangements of elastic components, but 
also include integrating a passive rigid kinematic chain to form 
a hybrid continuum-rigid manipulator. Results of this paper 
could contribute to the development of design guidelines for 
realizing desired stiffness properties of a continuum or hybrid 
manipulator.  
I. INTRODUCTION 
ONTINUUM manipulators, mentioned in [1], received a 
lot of attentions in the past decades due to their 
advantageous properties, such as intrinsic compliance, distal 
dexterity, etc. They have been applied in a variety of 
manipulation applications in unstructured settings [2-5].  
Continuum manipulators also have a great potential for 
medical applications because of their intrinsic soft interaction 
with human anatomy and the design compactness achieved by 
the dual roles of their elastic parts as both structural 
components and motion output members. They have been 
used as active cannulae [6, 7], catheters [8-10], endoscopes 
(such as arthroscope [11], colonoscope [12]), and surgical 
manipulators [13-15]. 
Some continuum manipulators were found especially 
useful to form a compact yet dexterous and versatile DDU 
(Distal Dexterity Unit) for surgical robotic systems. For 
example, the continuum manipulator had 8 DoFs (Degrees of 
Freedom) and an outer diameter of 4.2mm in the throat MIS 
(Minimally Invasive Surgery) robot [13], whereas the 
continuum manipulator had 7 DoFs (Degrees of Freedom) 
and an outer diameter of 6.5mm in the IREP robot [14].  
WhatÕs more, 15 DoFs for two manipulators and a vision unit 
were packed into a ¯12mm endoscopic robot for NOTES 
(Natural Orifices Transluminal Endoscopic Surgery) [15].

While applied in a DDU of a surgical robotic system, 
stiffness of these continuum manipulators is sometimes not 
high enough due to their intrinsic compliance. Insufficient 
stiffness could deteriorate the performance of such a DDU.  
Several attempts are made by this paper, aiming at 
improving the stiffness of a slim and multi-DoF continuum 
manipulator for future applications. The attempts include the 
placement of additional elastic components and the 
integration of a passive rigid kinematic chain.  
An experimental kinestatic comparison between three 
continuum manipulators is presented. As shown in Fig. 1, 
Structure-I has a simple structure and Structure-II has a 
highly redundant arrangement of elastic components, 
whereas Structure-III has a passive rigid kinematic chain 
integrated. In order to make the comparison fair and 
consistent, the three continuum manipulators all have the 
same outer diameter of 7 mm with an identical length of 33 
mm. Results of this paper could contribute to the development 
of design guidelines for continuum manipulators with desired 
stiffness properties.

Major contribution of this paper is the proposal and the 
experimental comparison of the approaches (use redundant 
elastic components and/or integrate a rigid kinematic chain) 
for the stiffness enhancement of continuum manipulators. 
The integration of a passive rigid kinematic chain opens new 
possibilities to design a hybrid continuum-rigid manipulator 
for desired stiffness properties. Minor contribution is the 
design and the implementation of a novel modular actuation 
scheme which conveniently drives all the continuum 
manipulators.  
The paper is organized as follows. Section II presents the 
comparison formulation. Kinematics and statics of the 
to-be-compared continuum manipulators are presented in 
Section III. Section IV presents a novel actuation scheme and 
the construction of the actuation unit. Detailed experimental 
characterization of the continuum manipulatorsÕ kinematics 
and stiffness properties are presented in Section V with 
conclusions and future work followed in Section VI.

II. COMPARISON FORMULATION 
Three continuum manipulators were compared as shown in 
Fig. 2. They all have the same outer diameter of 7 mm with an 
identical length of 33 mm. Referring to the specific designs in 
Fig. 2 and the generic structure in Fig. 3, Structure-I consists 
of three secondary backbones, an end disk, several spacer 
disks and a base disk. One virtual primary backbone can be 
identified in the center, which characterizes the shape and the 
length of Structure-I. The three secondary backbones are 
equidistant from each other and are only attached to the end 
disk. They can slide in the holes in the spacer disks and in the 
base disk. 2-DoF bending of Structure-I is realized by 
simultaneously pushing and pulling the secondary backbones. 
When Structure-I is applied as a surgical manipulator, it is 
expected to handle various payloads dexterously. Dexterity of 
the manipulator is often affected by the bending radius of the 
structure and a smaller bending radius could lead to more 
dexterous motions. For a manipulator with a specific length, 
the minimal bending radius puts a limit on the diameter of the 
secondary backbones. For this reason, it should not be the 
first option to use thicker backbones to improve the stiffness 
of Structure-I. Structure-II is hence formed by using more 
secondary backbones (18 in total). A 2-DoF bending of 
Structure-II could also be realized by simultaneously pushing 
and pulling all these secondary backbones. 
Stiffness properties of Structure-II could be further 
improved by integrating a passive rigid kinematic chain into 
the continuum structure to form a hybrid continuum-rigid 
manipulator. As shown in Fig. 2(c) and Fig. 4, a RRPRR 
kinematic chain is added into Structure-II to form 
Structure-III in order to improve the torsional rigidity. The 
proposal of Structure-III actually opens a wide variety of 
topological options for designing hybrid continuum-rigid 
structures with various stiffness properties. 
The three structures will be actuated according to their 
kinematics as presented in Section III. The actuation is 
realized in a modular way using the actuation scheme from 
Section IV. Experimental comparisons between the three 
structures in terms of the kinematics and the stiffness 
properties are presented in Section V.

III. NOMENCLATURE AND KINEMATICS 
This paper investigates possible means to improve the 
stiffness of a continuum manipulator for scenarios where high 
manipulation stiffness is desired. Preferably the increased 
stiffness will not result in a complicated kinematics model to 
hinder the real-time tele-operation of the manipulator.  
As demonstrated in [13, 14], the surgical continuum 
manipulator utilized the continuum segments similar to 
Structure-I and the simple kinematics model facilitated the 
tele-operation of the surgical manipulator. The kinematics of 
Structure-I depends on its shape and the shape was described 
and experimentally verified to be close enough to a circular 
arc [16]. Structure-II and Structure-III are designed for 
improved stiffness properties. Their shapes are still assumed 
to be circular when their kinematics is derived. Experimental 
characterization in Section V will validate this assumption, 
showing both structures still have simple circular shapes with 
enhanced stiffness properties.

C. Kinematics of Structure-II 
There are 18 secondary backbones in Structure-II and the 
structural parameters are listed in Table II.  
Redundant secondary backbones are added to improve the 
stiffness. Hence the differences between Structure-I and 
Structure-II only lie on the values of m , 
i
r and 
i
? . 
Structure-II should also be actuated by pushing and pulling 
the secondary backbones according to the actuation length

D. Kinematics of Structure-III 
The continuum components of Structure-III are identical to 
those of Structure-II, which are listed in Table II. A passive 
RRPRR rigid kinematic chain is integrated to further improve 
the torsional stiffness of the structure. Five additional 
configuration variables are hence introduced to describe the 
status of the RRPRR chain. 
As shown in Fig. 4, besides BDS { } b and EDS { } e , three 
additional coordinate systems ( { } r1 , { } r2 and { } r3 ) are 
assigned. Since { } b and { } e are assigned to describe the 
kinematics of the continuum manipulator, their attachment to 
the base and the end disks are not according to the

IV. IMPLEMENTATION OF A NOVEL ACTUATION SCHEME 
When a structure similar to Structure-I was actuated in [16], 
three motorized lead screws are used to push and pull the 
secondary backbones, according to the actuation kinematics 
as in Eq. (6). However, using 18 motors to drive Structure-II 
and Structure-III doesnÕt seem smart when their push-pull 
actuation depends on only two variables (
L
? and ? ).  
A novel modular actuation scheme is hence introduced. Fig. 
5(a) shows an extended continuum structure. It is formed as 
follows. A distal continuum structure is connected to a 
proximal continuum structure through a set of rigid guiding 
cannulae. The arrangement of the secondary backbones in the 
distal structure is scaled to that of the proximal structure. 
Bending of the proximal structure bends the distal structure in 
the opposite way. Fig. 5(b) shows an actuation continuum 
structure. It could be bent by pushing and pulling four 
actuation backbones. The extended continuum structure 
could be assembled into the actuation continuum structure so 
that the actuation structure deforms the proximal structure so 
as to drive the distal structure, no matter how many 
backbones are there in the distal continuum structure. 
This novel actuation scheme has a nice modular feature. 
Distal structures with different sizes can still be matched to 
the same proximal structure so that one actuation structure 
could drive many different distal structures.

The implemented actuation scheme is shown in Fig. 6. 
Four motorized ball screws push and pull four backbones of 
the actuation structure. A few sliding blocks prevent bulking 
of these backbones.

continuum manipulator while maintaining the simple 
presentation of its kinematics. Then a multi-DoF manipulator 
made from the stiffness-enhanced structures could be handily 
tele-operated while handling various payloads. 
This section hence firstly presents a series of experiments, 
identifying the shapes of the structures. Results would show 
that Structure-II and Structure-III are still quite close to 
circular shapes and their kinematics can still be described by 
the kinematics as in Section III. Then the stiffness of the three 
structures will be quantified and compared in Section V.B. 
A. Shape identification of the structures 
A series of experiments were firstly conducted to identify 
the shapes of the three structures. The goal is to check 
whether the shapes of Structure-II and Structure-III are still 
close to circular arcs. 
Each structure was bent to 4 configurations as listed in 
Table III. The actuation unit as in Fig. 6 was commended to 
push and pull the backbones for the actuated lengths 
according to the kinematics as in Eq. (6). Please be noted that 
Eq. (6) holds for the three to-be-compared structures as well 
as for the proximal continuum structure and the actuation 
continuum structure in the actuation unit shown in Fig. 5. The 
actual actuation lengths from the ball screws were converted 
according to the size ratio between the actuation continuum 
structure and Structure-I, Structure-II or Structure-III. 
The shape identification process is based on an imaging 
process technique as detailed in [16, 17]. As shown in Fig. 7, 
after the surrounding pixels were manually erased, edges 
were then detected. All the points on the detected edges were 
used for curve fitting. Although the edge points from the 
background (or the internal structure) were not excluded, the 
shape identification errors would not be excessive since these 
points are approximately evenly distributed within the shape. 
Curve fitting results were overlaid back to the original picture 
to examine whether the fitted curves matched the shapes of 
the structures.  
Using the curve fitting results, plots of bending angles 
versus curve lengths can be found in Fig. 8. Due to the 
definition of 
L
? , the bending angle is equal to 90
L
? ¡? . 
Namely 30
L
? =? ¡ corresponds to a 120¡ bending, whereas  
60
L
? =¡ corresponds to a 30¡ bending. 
Results from Fig.8 showed that Structure-I and Structure-II 
bend to shapes very close to circular arcs. The results for 
Structure-I are consistent with previous results [16, 17].  
Structure-III still has bending shapes close to circular arcs 
when the bending angles are relatively small. Its shapes differ 
from circular arcs when the total bending angle increases. The 
phenomenon is mainly due to the friction from the passive 
rigid kinematic chain inside. The bending performance of 
Structure-III can be improved by fabricating the parts of the 
rigid kinematic chain to tighter tolerances. 
All the three structures bent less than the commanded 
bending angles. As shown in Fig. 8, when the structures were 
commanded to bend 120¼ ( 30
L
? =? ¡), they only bent for 
about 95¼. This phenomenon is also consistent with previous 
results [19]. 
 It should also be noted that the same amount of actuation 
led to slightly different bending of the three structures: 
Structure-I bent the most and Structure-III bent the least. 
Obviously the increase in the number of structural 
components from Structure-I to Structure-III caused more 
bending resistance. Bending of each structure could be 
individually calibrated and compensated as in [19].

was achieved. 
The continuum structures were either at their straight 
configurations or bent to a configuration listed in Table III. 
The XYZ motion stage firstly moved the probe to start 
touching the tip of the continuum structure. Then the structure 
was perturbed for a few millimeters in XYZ directions and 
the reaction forces were recorded by the force sensor. The 
stiffness was calculated as the reaction force divided by the 
deflection distance (perturbation distance). This approach of 
quantifying stiffness was also practiced in [17].

configuration listed in Table III.

y directions are plotted with respect to the commanded 
bending angles in Fig. 11.  
From the results in Fig. 11, one can make the following 
observations. 
¥ Structure-III has a higher stiffness than Structure-II due to 
the presentence of the passive rigid kinematic chain.  
¥ Structure-II has 18 backbones while Structure-I only has 3 
backbones. ItÕs understandable that Structure-II has a 
higher stiffness. But the stiffness is only about 3 to 4 times 
higher. This means when more backbones are included, 
they donÕt contribute equally and the stiffness doesnÕt 
increase linearly.  
¥ When the commanded bending angle is 0¼ (in a straight 
configuration), the Structure-IIÕs stiffness in the ö
b
x 
direction is similar to that in the ö
b
y direction due to the 
structure symmetry. The Structure-IIIÕs stiffness in the ö
b
x 
direction is higher than that in the ö
b
y direction due to the 
non-symmetrical structure of the passive kinematic chain. 
¥ When the commanded bending angel increases, the 
structuresÕ stiffness in the ö
b
x direction all increase. The 
reason could be qualitatively explained. When an external 
perturbation is applied to the tip, the structure deflects and 
the external perturbation does positive work to increase 
the elastic potential energy of the structure. If the original 
system energy is higher, the structure might deflect less 
for the same perturbation because the same small amount 
of energy input would generate a smaller shape variation. 
¥ On the other hand, the stiffness of Structure-I and 
Structure-II in the ö
b
y direction decreases when the 
structures bend more. This is because the perturbation at 
the tip in the ö
b
y direction exerts a torque at the structuresÕ 
base. The low torsional stiffness of the two structures 
leads to low translational stiffness at the tip in the ö
b
y 
direction. The rigid kinematic chain in Structure-III is 
integrated to improve the torsional rigidity. The enhanced 
torsional rigidity results in the improved translational 
stiffness at the tip of Structure-III. 
According to the stiffness values of Structure-III, if it is 
implemented in a surgical robot to manipulate a payload of 
2N, the distal deflection would be about 0.7 to 2.5mm.  
VI. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
Continuum structures become popular in medical systems 
due to i) their intrinsic compliance for safe interactions and/or 
ii) the design compactness for distal dexterity achieved by 
stacking multiple segments and streaming actuation from a 
proximal unit to the distal end.  
Continuum manipulators are sometimes expected to have 
relatively high stiffness to handle payloads in robotic 
surgeries. This paper hence explores how to enhance the 
stiffness properties by presenting an experimental kinestatic 
study between three different continuum manipulators. The 
objective is to maintain simple circular shapes for the bent 
continuum segments but to improve the stiffness properties. 
The addition of more backbones is enabled by the 
introduction of a novel modular actuation scheme. WhatÕs 
more, a passive rigid kinematic chain is integrated to further

improve the stiffness. The RRPRR chain from this paper is 
designed for better torsional rigidity. With more backbones 
plus and a rigid kinematic chain, the translational stiffness of 
Structure-III is now 5 to 6 times better than that of Structure-I.  
Results of this paper also open a few topics for future 
studies. An elasticity model is needed to reveal the changes in 
stiffness with respect to the changes in the number of 
backbones. Then the optimal number of backbones could be 
determined. Moreover, further understanding is also greatly 
needed on how to design a hybrid continuum-rigid 
manipulator for better or controllable stiffness properties.
