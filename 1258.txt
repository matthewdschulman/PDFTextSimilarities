Abstract?Retinal surgery is one of the most challenging types
of surgery because of the scale and the fragility of the human
eye anatomy. The surgeon suffers from limited positioning
accuracy, tremor and poor force feedback directly affecting
the quality of the surgical procedures. To tackle these issues,
we developed a teleoperation system to assist surgeons during
retinal surgery. The system offers features like motion scaling,
tremor compensation and scaled force feedback. This paper
reports on the design of the slave and the master.
I. INTRODUCTION
During retinal surgery, the surgeon performs procedures
at the retina. Figure 1 conceptually illustrates the surgical
scene inside the eye. Retinal surgery is a type of Minimally
Invasive Surgery (MIS). Small incisions are made in the
sclera and equipped with trocars. The surgeon manually
guides the surgical instruments through the trocars and avoids
moving these trocars as much as possible in order to keep
the eye steady and to prevent excessive forces on the sclera.
This limits the degrees of freedom (DOFs) at the incision
point to three rotations q, f and y and a translation R.
In some cases the instrument consists of a gripper which
can be considered as a fth DOF. The surgeon uses a
stereoscopic microscope placed just above the patient's eye
lens to get visual feedback on the surgical scene (see Fig. 2).
Because of the presence of the microscope the surgeon can
only move the instruments in a very conned space. The
surgeon manipulates the instruments while placing his/her
hands on the patient's forehead minimizing the force loop
and therefore resulting in the highest achievable positioning
precision. Still, retinal surgery is considered as one of the
most challenging types of surgery because of the scale and
the fragility of the retinal anatomy. Retinal tissue can be as
thin as 25m and retinal vessels can have a diameter as
small as 10m. Riviere et al. [1] showed that the surgeon
suffers from physiological tremor with an rms amplitude of
182m. Gupta et al. [2] showed that 75% of the interaction
forces between the instrument and the retina are lower than
7:5 mN. The surgeon can only feel these forces in 19%
of the cases explaining why the surgeon can rely solely
on visual feedback. These limitations directly affect the
quality of these difcult procedures [2]. For some envisioned
treatment methods, it is even impossible to safely perform
the necessary manipulations leaving the surgeon to rely on
less effective treatment methods.

Fig. 1. Retinal surgeons generally use 4 DOFs to manoeuvre instruments
inside the eye: three rotations q, f and y around the incision point
and a translation R through the incision point. Translational movements
tangential to the eye ball are avoided since these movements rotate the eye,
complicating targeting, and can result in excessive forces on the sclera.

needs to operate in a highly conned space due to the presence of the
microscope and a spherical lens. The spherical lens is used to get a large
viewing angle inside the eye without the necessity to rotate the eye during
the procedure.
A fair number of robotic systems for retinal surgery have
been reported in literature to address the abovementioned
issues. Riviere's group at Carnegie Mellon University
developed a hand-held device capable of limited motion
scaling and actively reducing tremor [3]. Taylor's group
at Johns Hopkins University rstly introduced a co-
manipulation technique for retinal surgery [4]. Here, the
surgeon shares control over the instrument with a robotic
arm. The robotic arm successfully lters all noticeable
tremor and limits the speed of the instrument in order
to obtain a higher positioning accuracy. The same group
also does research on the development of force sensors
which can be integrated in the surgical tool. The use
of these force sensors enables the implementation of
force-based virtual xtures and auditive feedback on
the level of forces applied by the surgeon. Steinbuch's
group at TUEindhoven developed a teleoperation system

consisting of a custom-made haptic master controlling
the movements of custom-made slave. Benets of such
a system like motion scaling, tremor compensation and
scaled force feedback motivate their work [5]. Other robotic
systems designed for retinal surgery are described in [6]?[9].
Previously, the authors developed a surgical manipulator
to assist surgeons during retinal procedures using the co-
manipulation technique [10], [11]. Within the scope of the
same research project, this system was extended towards
a teleoperation system to explore possible additional ben-
ets like motion scaling, scaled force feedback and better
ergonomics and to validate whether these advantages truly
outweigh the additional complexity of such system. This
paper reports on the design of the slave and the master which
form this newly designed teleoperation system. Section II
briey discusses the most important design requirements
of the teleoperation system. Section III and IV discuss the
design of the slave and the master respectively. Section V
presents the realised system.
II. DESIGN REQUIREMENTS
In interaction with several microsurgeons a non-exhaustive
list of design requirements was compiled. The most
fundamental requirements are described below.
The targeted procedures are retinal vessel cannulation and
epiretinal membrane peeling, since it is extremely difcult to
perform these treatments adequately. During a retinal vessel
cannulation, a needle needs to be inserted into a retinal vessel
with a diameter as small as 10m in order to inject a uid.
During epiretinal membrane peeling, the surgeon's goal is
to remove scar tissue located on top of the retina with an
approximate thickness of 25m. The surgeon requires an
available workspace on the retina of 60

around the center
of the eye to perform these delicate procedures. To provide
sufcient manipulation freedom, this area is increased to
90

(see Fig. 3). In order to reach the retina with his/her
instruments, the surgeon creates an incision at approximately
4 mm from the corneal limbus. No vital tissue is present at
this location. Considering this data and taking into account
the variety of the human eye anatomy [12], ranges for the
desirable DOFs are derived and summarized in Table I. A
positioning precision of 3m at the tip of the instrument
is sufcient to safely manipulate the thinnest retinal tissue
and the smallest retinal vessels. From this target value, the
desirable precision for the different DOFs is calculated (Table
I). Consideration of instruments with a curved tip and their
intended application leads to a desirable precision of 1

for
the y-DOF. Based on experiments, forces at the control
handle of the master up to 10 N in the R-, q- and f-DOF
and a torque in the y-DOF up to 50 mNm are considered to
be useful for high delity force feedback. Initially, a possible
fth DOF, incorporated in the instrument, is not considered
since this DOF is not necessarily required in order to perform
the envisioned procedures.

III. THE SLAVE
As mentioned earlier, the authors already developed a robotic
manipulator for assistance during retinal surgery using a co-
manipulation technique. This robotic manipulator complies
with all stated design requirements, except for the y-DOF
which was designed to be passive for this shared-control
technique. To solve this issue, an active y-module was
designed and integrated in the system. Also the Rq-drive
mechanism was redesigned and updated. The new robotic
manipulator is suited to be used as the slave in the intended
teleoperation system. The derivation of the kinematic struc-
ture and the associated kinematic equations and workspace
are detailed in [11]. This section briey resumes the outline
of the kinematic structure and discusses the updated design
of the slave.
A. Kinematics of the slave mechanism
As mentioned earlier, only 4 DOFs (R,q, f and y) are
required at the incision during retinal surgery. The slave
implements these DOFs at a point distal from its mechanical
components. In this way, the area around the incision point
is kept unoccupied when both points are pre-operatively
aligned. Such a point is called a Remote Center of Motion
(RCM) and can be implemented using an RCM mechanism.
A handful of substantially different RCM mechanisms have
been reported in literature [13]. None of the earlier designs
appeared to be really suited to be incorporated in the slave
since they all realise the R-DOF by adding a linear drive
mechanism at the end-effector. Considering the tight space
constraints associated with retinal procedures as discussed
earlier, such a voluminous end-effector is not desirable.
2358
Therefore a novel 4 DOF RCM mechanism, depicted in
Fig. 4, that implements the R-DOF at the base of the
mechanism was designed. The mechanism can tilt around
the f-axis. The R- and q-movements are implemented using
a multi-parallelogram bar mechanism. The prismatic joint
at the base of the mechanism allows remote actuation of
the insertion and retraction motion and thus helps keeping
the end-effector more compact. Figure 5 demonstrates the
working principle for actuating the q- and R-movement
respectively. The y-DOF is implemented at the end-effector
since this can be done in a compact way as detailed later on.
Thef- andy-DOF are controlled independently using joints
q
1
and q
4
respectively. The R- and q-DOF are controlled
simultaneoulsy by using joints q
2
and q
3

B. Design details of the slave
Figure 6 depicts a perspective view on the nal design
of the slave. Nearly all moving components are mounted
on top of a base. This base can turn around the f-axis
with respect to the support structure. The linkages of the
Rq-mechanism are H-shaped and t into one another to
prevent collisions inside the intended workspace. The system
is almost perfectly symmetric with respect to a plane through
f-axis and perpendicular to the base. Counterweights are
attached to both the q
2
- and the q
3
-linkage. Thanks to these
design considerations, gravitational effects on the slave are
negligible with respect to the torque characteristics of the
different drive mechanisms. Joints q
1
, q
2
and q
3
are driven
by capstan drive mechanisms to avoid backlash and limit
friction. Figure 7 shows the arrangement of these drive
mechanisms. All three are actuated by a Maxon RE30 DC-
motor. The capstan gear ratios are equal to 12:1, 10:1 and
10:1 respectively. To achieve the desired positioning accuracy
at the tip of the needle, the q
1
-motor is equipped with a
GPI 65536 cpr (counts per revolution) encoder. The q
2
- and
q
3
-drives both contain a GPI 144000 cpr encoder. Note that
these encoders are directly attached to the q
2
- and q
3
-axis
respectively. The y-module consists of a drive mechanism
to rotate the instrument around its axis and an instrument
clamping mechanism (see Fig. 8). The clamping mechanism
comprises a collet washer and a collet which is screwed into
a hollow shaft. Placing an instrument through the hollow
shaft and manually rotating the washer with respect to the
shaft will x the instrument. The hollow shaft is driven by
the q
4
-drive mechanism. Here, the actuation is provided by
a Maxon RE8 DC-motor equipped with a Maxon MR 100
CPT encoder and a 6:1 zero-backlash gear set. The overall
dimensions of the slave are 27 37 20 cm. The total mass
of the moving parts is limited to 1:5 kg. Table II summarizes
the range, accuracy, resolution and force/torque for the dif-
ferent DOFs of the slave. By comparing Table I and Table II
it can be seen that all the design requirements are effectively
met. Since the workspace shape of the Rq-mechanism is
non-polar, no general range can be dened for the R- and
q-DOF. Nevertheless, the workspace is sufciently large to
span the intended workspace on the retina [11].

IV. THE MASTER
Master devices used in teleoperation systems for MIS are
typically designed for Cartesian control, mapping the mo-
tions of the master handle onto the tip of the surgical
instrument, with or without additional local DOFs. In this
way, dexterity loss due to problematic hand-eye coordination
and motion inversion, typical to MIS but not present in
conventional open surgery, can be alleviated. On the contrary,
retinal surgeons are used to this MIS way of instrument
manipulation and might even prefer it. This motivates the use
of a spherical master in the intended teleoperation system.
Such a spherical master can also compensate for motion
inversion, like illustrated by Fig. 9. None of the commercially
available haptic masters complies with the stated design

requirements. Therefore a custom-made haptic master is
developed. Since no previous work by the authors describes
the development of this device, the design will be discussed
here in greater detail.
A. Kinematics of the master mechanism
The master consists of novel spherical mechanism able to
move a handle in 4 DOFs R, q, f and y (see Fig. 10).
The master implements these DOFs at a Local Center of
Motion (LCM). The mechanism can tilt around the q-
axis. The R- and f-movements are implemented using a
parallelogram-based bar mechanism attached to the handle.
The handle is supported by a revolute and prismatic joint
at the LCM. Figure 11 demonstrates a f- and R-movement
of this mechanism respectively. The y-DOF is implemented
locally at the handle. The q- and y-DOF are controlled
independently using joints q
1
and q
4
respectively. The R-
andf-DOF are controlled simultaneously using joints q
2
and
q
3
. The arc and the two circles tangent to this arc depicted
in Fig. 10 represent two capstan drive mechanisms used to
control joints q

 p. These singularities correspond to the
congurations where two pair of consecutive linkages of
the parallelogram are parallel.
The link length a is chosen to t the workspace of the Rf-
mechanism to the kinematic requirements listed in Table
I. Collisions between the mechanical components of the
Rf-mechanism, inuencing the workspace, are taken into
account. Multiple design iterations led to a link length a=
51 mm. The resulting workspace boundaries are described

These singularities clearly lie outside the workspace. Rf-
workspace is calculated using the forward kinematic equa-
tions (which will be referred to as FKE in the following).
Since the Rf-mechanism is a polar mechanism, similar
conclusions regarding the workspace can be drawn using any
reference point on the handle. For clarity of the resulting
gure, point A on the handle is used as a reference point

Figure 12 shows the resulting Rf-workspace (green). The
design requirement (blue) is clearly met. The extra space the
workspace offers is useful when a scaling factor between the
master and slave motions is applied.
B. Design details of the master
Figure 13 depicts a perspective view on the nal design
of the master. The Rqfy-mechanism is rigidly attached to
a back plate elevating the system with respect to a hand
support plate. In this way, it is possible to freely move the
handle inside the intended workspace while avoiding any
collision between the surgeon's hand and the device. The
Rfy-module can rotate around the q-axis with respect to
the mechanism support structure. This DOF is driven by a
capstan drive mechanism to avoid backlash and limit friction.
The drive consists of a Maxon RE30 DC-motor equipped
with a Scancon 7500 cpr encoder which remains stationary
with respect to the support structure. The capstan gear ratio
is equal to 26:1. The the Rfy-module is covered, protecting
its components from being damaged. The handle has a length
of 100 mm and a diameter of 10 mm. These dimensions are
comparable to those of a surgical tool.
Figure 14 shows the design of the Rf-module. For clarity,
the y-module is made invisible in this gure. The linkages
of the parallelogram are angled to maximise the available
workspace while keeping the mechanism as compact as
possible. The q-,f- and y-axis intersect in the LCM. The
prismatic joint at the LCM is implemented by virtue of a ball
spline. The use of a ball spline rather than a conventional
linear bushing is motivated later on. Joints q
2
and q
3
are
driven by two seperate capstan drive mechanisms in order
to move the parallelogram structure. Each drive consists of
a Maxon RE30 DC-motor equipped with a Scancon 7500

attached to the support frame of the Rf-module. The capstan
mechanism is composed out of three capstans. The motor
pulley and Capstan No.1 are used to magnify the motor
torque. The gear ratio of this capstan mechanism is equal
to 5,4:1. Capstan No.2 and No.3 form a cable-based bevel
transmission. This is done to prevent collisions between
the q

-capstan drive mechanism and the Rf-module while
keeping the total master as compact as possible.
The overall dimensions of the master are 27 27 20 cm.
Table II summarizes the range, accuracy, resolution and
force/torque for the different DOFs of the master. By com-
paring Table I and Table III it can be seen that nearly all
the design requirements are effectively met. The torque in
the y-DOF forms an exception which is in fact very close
to its specication of 50 mNm and the range of the y-
DOF is limited to 210

because of the q
4
capstan drive
mechanism. The latter forms no problem since the master can
momentarily be decoupled from the slave and repositioned
when this workspace limit is met.

slave, the setup contains a stereoscopic microscope and a
mockup of a human eye. Figure 17 depicts the eye mockup.
The eye is inserted into a cardan-like mechanism in order
to simulate the natural rotational DOFs of a human eye. A
custom-made articial retina is made and placed inside the
eye to enable the simulation of some of the most challenging
retinal procedures in a non-clinical environment. In order
to align the RCM of the slave with the incision in the
eye, the eye mockup is mounted upon a XYZ-platform.
Preliminary control schemes already have been implemented
in the teleoperation system. Video recordings in attachment
to this paper demonstrate the RCM of the slave and features
like tremor compensation and motion scaling between the
master and the slave.
VI. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
This work reported on the development of a teleoperation
system to assist retinal surgeons during the most delicate
procedures. The system enables motion scaling, tremor com-
pensation, the implementation of active constraints or scaled
force feedback. For this purpose a slave and master were
designed. The slave device consists of an innovative 4DOF
RCM mechanism kinematically constraining the incision
point to prevent unwanted eye motions and excessive force
on the sclera. The slave is controlled using a 4DOF spher-
ical master. The device is active in all its DOFs enabling
the implementation of active constraints and scaled force
feedback of the interaction forces between the retinal tissue
and the instrument. Both the master and the slave have been
successfully fabricated. Currently, the authors are working
on the development of force sensors which can be integrated
in the surgical tool. Experiments with scaled force feedback
will follow in the future.
