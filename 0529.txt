Ego-motion Noise Suppression for Robots
Based on Semi-Blind InÞnite Non-negative Matrix Factorization
Taiki Tezuka, Takami Yoshida, and Kazuhiro Nakadai
AbstractÑThis paper addresses ego-motion noise suppres-
sion for a robot. Many methods use motion information such
as position, velocity and acceleration of each joint to infer
ego-motion noise. However, such inference is not reliable since
motion information and ego-motion noise are not at all times
correlated. We propose a new framework for ego-motion noise
suppression based on single channel processing without using
any explicit motion information. In the proposed framework,
ego-motion noise features are estimated in advance from an
ego-motion noise input with InÞnite Non-negative Matrix Fac-
torization (INMF) which is a non-parametric Bayesian model.
Afterthat,theproposedSemi-BlindINMF(SB-INMF)isapplied
to an input signal consisting of both the target and ego-
motion noise signals. The ego-motion noise features which
are obtained with INMF are used as input to the SB-INMF
and treated as the Þxed features to extract the target signal.
Finally, the target signal is extracted using newly-estimated
features with SB-INMF. The proposed framework was applied
to ego-motion noise suppression on two types of humanoid
robots. Experimental results showed that ego-motion noise was
suppressedwellcomparedtoaconventionaltemplate-basedego-
motion noise suppression method using motion information,
and thus it worked properly on a robot which does not have
an interface to provide the robotÕs motion information.

I. INTRODUCTION
Robot audition is one of the most essential capabilities
for a robot to interact with people. It has been studied since
it was proposed in 2000 [1]. It aims at building auditory
functions using a robotÕs embedded microphones. Many
kinds of robot audition systems have been reported such
as binaural approaches [2]Ð[7], microphone array based ap-
proaches [8]Ð[11], multi-modal integration [2], [12], and the
use of ubiquitous sensors [13]Ð[15]. Sound source localiza-
tion, separation and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) are
primary research topics in robot audition, and one common
issue for these topics is ego-motion noise suppression. A
robot should be able to interact with people simultaneously
even when it is performing other tasks such as manipulating
objects, dancing, etc. In such cases, however, ego-motion
noiseisinevitablygenerated,andarobotÕsauditoryfunctions
easily deteriorate.

Since ego-motion noise is an essential problem in auditory
processing for robots, there exists several studies on ego-
noise suppression. They are classiÞed into two approaches.
One is to use additional sensors to obtain ego-motion noise,
and the other is the use of joint status which is regarded as
correlated with ego-motion noise.
For the Þrst approach, Nakadai et al. proposed ego-
noise suppression by introducing the concepts of auditory
embodiment [1]. They used two pairs of microphones; one
pair is located at the ear positions of a robot cover (external
microphones), and the other is located inside the cover
(internal microphones). By comparing these two pairs, a
robot can distinguish its internal and external worlds. In
short, a robot can identify if the sound originates either
from the inside or outside of it. When the sound comes
from inside the robot, it ignores such noisy time frames
by treating them as ego-motion parts. Indeed, that approach
was effective for sound source localization, but difÞcult to
apply to sound source separation and speech enhancement
because these functions require a continuous signal. Even
et al. applied Frequency-Domain Blind Signal Separation
(FD-BSS)tointernalnoiseestimationbyinstallingadditional
sensors inside a robot mainly to detect internal noise [16].
A multichannel Wiener Þlter was performed to enhance a
target speech signal. This was applied to a hands-free spoken
dialog system for a robot. However, their method requires
additional sensors in addition to microphones, and their
placement which would be crucial in terms of performance
was not discussed. In the end, in this approach, additional
microphones or sensors are necessary to obtain ego-motion
noise, which makes a system more complicated, and results
in expensive computational cost.
The second approach is based on the fact that ego-motion
noise is generated by movements of joints, and thus, ego-
motion noise is strongly correlated with joint status. For
instance, Ito et al. introduced ArtiÞcial Neural Network
(ANN) to estimate ego-motion noise model [17]. They Þrst
observed joint positions and angles and fed them to ANN to
train an ego-motion noise model. After that, they estimated
ego-motion noise with the trained ANN using a set of joint
positions and angles observed in a frame-by-frame manner.
Finally, the estimated ego-motion noise was subtracted from
the noisy input signal with conventional Spectral Subtraction
(SS) [18]. They showed the effectiveness of their methods
although synthesized data was used as input.
Nishimura et al. reported command-based ego-motion
noise estimation [3]. They prepared an ego-motion noise
template corresponding to a motion command, and ego-

motion noise was queried from the templates according to
a motion command. The estimated ego-motion noise was
subtracted with SS [17], and they also applied missing
featuretheory[19]todealwithadistortedspeechsignalwith
SS in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). They showed
that the proposed method worked well using a real humanoid
robot, even though it is difÞcult to deal with a non-prepared
motionandamorecomplicatedmotionlikeacombinationof
multiple motions with their motion-command-based method.
Ince et al. have reported extensive work on ego-motion
noise estimation for robots. They proposed to use frame-
based templates, and ego-motion noise estimation was per-
formed in a frame-by-frame basis by combining templates
according to the observed joint status such as angle, angular
velocity and angular acceleration. They conÞrmed that their
method improves the three main functions in robot audition,
i.e., sound source localization, sound source separation and
ASR[20]bycombiningitwithmicrophonearrayprocessing.
They applied their method to an interactive musical robot,
which can dance according to musical beats detected with
its own microphones, and at the same time, it can listen to a
userÕs question and answer it under an ego-motion and music
noise condition [21]. However, they assume that the same
motion generates the same ego-motion noise all the time. In
a real situation, this assumption does not hold, and the error
of ego-motion noise estimation makes severe distortion after
SS, which degrades ASR performance drastically.
The second approach worked properly compared to the
conventional noise suppression techniques such as micro-
phone array processing and echo cancellation, since joint
status was used as prior information. Ego-motion noise may
be correlated to some extent with joint status information,
but in most cases, it is not. It means that ego-motion noise
inference based on joint status information inevitably has
an error, which usually causes performance degradation in
post processing such as ASR. Since the second approach is
based on unreliable information to some extent, it would be
difÞcult to achieve further improvements of the performance
with this approach, and there is a long way to realize ego-
noise suppression for active audition which utilizes active
motions for better perception.
Therefore, we propose a new ego-motion noise suppres-
sion method which requires only one microphone without
using any additional sensor and which does not rely on
problematic joint status information by introducing Semi-
Blind InÞnite Non-negative Matrix Factorization (SB-INMF)
which is a Non-Parametric Bayesian (NPB) model. The
methodsbasedonjointstatusinformationcannotavoiderrors
caused by spectral and temporal ßuctuation of ego-motion
noise for one motion as discussed above. The proposed
SB-INMF directly models ego-motion noise from an input
signal in a non-parametric Bayesian approach to avoid such
errors, and it can explicitly separate ego-motion noise and
target signals with a linear process by introducing a semi-
blind approach, which produces less distortions compared to
conventional SS-based methods.
We also show that the proposed method achieves ßexible

The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section II
formulates an ego-motion noise model and proposes its
estimation algorithm Semi-Blind Non-negative Matrix Fac-
torization (SB-INMF) based on a non-parametric Bayesian
model. Section III describes a prototype ego-motion noise
suppression system based on SB-INMF. Section IV evaluates
the system and gives discussions. The last section concludes
this paper with insights of our future work.
II. SEMI-BLIND NON-NEGATIVE MATRIX
FACTORIZATION FOR EGO-MOTION NOISE SUPPRESSION
Tab. I describes notations used in this paper. Ego-motion
noise is mainly caused by moving joints, and it is natural
to consider that ego-motion noise can be represented by
a combination of noise generated by all moving joints. In
such case, Latent Feature Model (LFM) which explains
data by adding multiple features selected from Þnite feature
candidates as shown in Fig. 1, where X, Z, and F show
N?D data, N?K activation, and K?D feature matrices,
respectively.
In signal processing, to solve such a decomposition prob-
lem, Blind Source Separation (BSS) [11], [22] is a common
approach. BSS is used for sound source separation, and it
is based on statistical information and microphone array
processing. Recently, much attention has been drawn to Non-
negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) since it can separate
sound sources even when an input signal is monaural [23].
Sinceego-motionnoiseofeachjointhasnon-negativepower,
it is natural to use NMF to represent the whole ego-motion
noise. In particular, exponential distributions are used to
separate an acoustic signal with NMF [24].

Fig. 2. A Graphical Model for INMF
When we use NMF to estimate LFM for ego-motion noise
estimation,wehavetoconsidertwoissues;Ego-motionnoise
and joint status information are not fully correlated, and the
number of features obtained by NMF for ego-motion noise
may not correspond to that of joints, i.e., the appropriate
number of features is unknown. To deal with these issues,
we introduce an extension of LFM using an NPB approach
called InÞnite Latent Feature Model (ILFM). It allows LFM
to have an unbounded number of feature candidates, and it
automatically estimates the most likely number of feature
candidates to represent the data. In this paper, ILFM is
modeled using a Gamma process, which is a non-parametric
stochastic process. NMF is also extended so that it can deal
with ILFM, which is called InÞnite Non-negative Matrix
Factorization (INMF) [26]. INMF for ego-motion noise is
formulated by

Since this model assumes a prior distribution based on a
Gamma process for each element of a non-negative matrix,
it is also called Gamma Process Non-negative Matrix Fac-
torization (GaP-NMF). Fig. 2 illustrates a graphical model
of INMF. White and dark circles show latent and observed
variables. A black dot shows manually-speciÞed parameters,
and multiple nodes can be bundled using a plate. This model
simultaneously estimates f, z, and ? by assuming Eqs. (2)Ð
(5), when ego-motion noise x is observed.
Ego-motion noise can be modeled with INMF as long as
an input signal consists only of ego-motion noise. However,
in reality, the input signal may contain a target signal such as
speech. When such a signal is included, features obtained by
INMF are affected; features including both ego-motion noise
and the target signal are obtained, and/or it is difÞcult to
know which features correspond to ego-motion noise among
the obtained features. To solve this problem, we propose
Semi-Blind INMF (SB-INMF). SB-INMF takes a mixture of
ego-motion noise and a target signal as an input.

estimation and suppression based on SB-INMF. It consists
of two phases, that is, training and noise suppression. The
upper panel of Fig. 3 shows the training phase to obtain ego-
motion noise features. Ego-motion noise is captured with
a microphone at a 16kHz sampling rate. After Short-Time
Fourier Transform (STFT)with a 256pt window and a 160pt
window shift is performed,X

ego-motion noise features are obtained as the trained

phase. The input speech is contaminated with ego-motion
noise. It is transformed into X

with STFT. SB-INMF
is performed for inference. In SB-INMF, the trained ego-
motion noise model F

is used as a set of given features.
Since X

also includes a speech signal, an additional
feature setF
s
which corresponds to speech is obtained. The
noise-suppressed speech is reconstructed by multiplying the

is estimated at the same time using the given feature setF

IV. EVALUATION
We evaluated the proposed method as follows:
1) ego-motion noise estimation
2) ego-motion noise suppression for synthesized data
3) ego-motion noise suppression for recorded data
The purpose of the Þrst experiment is to validate that ego-
motion noise can be modeled in the training phase. Thus, we

did not add any other sound sources to an input besides ego-
motion noise. The other two experiments are to validate that
the proposed ego-motion noise suppression works properly
for simulated and real data.
A. Humanoid Robots
We used two types of humanoid robots Hearbo
and Robovie-W. Hearbo includes 34 Degrees-of-Freedom
(DoFs), shown in Fig. 4. An 8ch microphone array is
mounted on the top of the robotÕs head, and we used the
microphone on the forehead for recording. In this robot, each
joint status can be obtained synchronously with audio infor-
mation using ROS. Robovie-W is a commercially-available
small robot with 17 DoFs. We put a hat with a microphone
on the head for audio recording. We can send commands
to control this robot, but it is not possible to obtain joint
status. This means that motion information cannot be used
for ego-motion noise suppression in this case.
B. Data Preparation
For Hearbo, we selected Þve joints for the right arm such
asshoulderpitch(J1),shoulderroll(J2),armyaw(J3),elbow
pitch (J4), and forearm roll (J5), and recorded the following
ego-motion noise data. The recording was conducted in a
room of 4m? 7m? 3m. Hearbo was located at the center
of the room, and a loudspeaker was located 1.2m away in
front of the robot.
D1 Eachjointwasmovedforaround20sseparatelyinturn.
In total, 110s of ego-motion noise was recorded.
D2 J1 was moved for 40s, and in the last 20s, speech was
also played from the loudspeaker.
D3 Two joints (J1 and J2) were moved simultaneously for
40s, and in the last 20s, speech was also played from
the loudspeaker.
D4 Threejoints(J1,J2,andJ3)weremovedsimultaneously
for 40s, and speech was played for the last 20s.
D5 Four joints (J1 Ð J4) were moved simultaneously for
40s, and speech was played in the last half.
D6 Five joints (J1 Ð J5) were moved simultaneously for
40s, and speech was played in the last half.
In every experiment, D1 was used as training data, i.e., ego-
motion noise features for D1 were estimated with INMF. For
the Þrst experiment, D1 was also used for test data. For the
second experiment, we added a clean speech signal to D1.
As for the clean speech, we used the same signal as played
from the loudspeaker for D2ÐD6. For the last experiment,
D2ÐD6 were used for test data.
For Robovie-W, Þve joints like waist yaw, shoulder roll
(L and R) and elbow roll (L and R). It was put on a table
located at another room of 10m ? 10m ? 3m.

R2 A person spoke to the robot at 2m distance during
performing the same motion as R1.
In every experiment, R1 was used as training data. For test
data, R1, a mixed signal of R1 and a clean speech signal,
and R2 were used for experiment 1Ð3, respectively.

Robovie-W due to lack of motion information.
D. Results
Tab. II shows the result for the Þrst and the second
experiments. The number of features in the proposed method
corresponds to that of templates in template-based ego-
motion noise estimation. Even when 7 features for Hearbo
and 5 features for Robovie-W were used for ego-motion
noise with the proposed method, NEE was better than
the template-based method with over 300 templates, which
shows that the proposed method models ego-motion noise
better. Since Þve joints were used in this experiment for
each robot, it is obvious that joints and features do not
have one-to-one correspondence, which indicates that it is
difÞcult to model ego-motion noise when using only joint
status information.
In the second experiment, 2 features for Hearbo were
additionally estimated as speech features. In total, only
9 features were necessary to model the input signal. In
SNR
1
, the proposed method demonstrated equivalent per-
formance with the template-based noise suppression with
1,022 templates. In SIR and SDR, the proposed method
showedthebestperformancecomparedtothetemplate-based
method regardless of the number of templates. The larger
number of features or templates requires high computational
cost, it is a big advantage that only a small number of
featuresisnecessary.Figs.6and7illustratethespectrograms
obtained in the second experiment for Hearbo and Robovie-
W, respectively. Fig. 6a) is a mixed signal generated by
additionofFig.6b)andc).Fig.6e)-f)isreconstructedsignals
with the proposed method for a mixed signal, ego-motion
noise, and speech, respectively. From these spectrograms, we
can see that signals are successfully reconstructed while the
reconstructed signals blur to some extent. For Robovie-W, it
is impossible to compare with the template based method,
but it showed similar performance to the HearboÕs case both
in Tab. II and Fig. 7. These results show that ego-motion
noise and speech features are estimated properly with the
proposed method.
Tab. III shows the results of the third experiment. We
selected the best scores for SNR
2
by changing the number
of features and templates, and Ò# of templatesÓ means the
number when SNR
2
has the best score. In every case,
the proposed method improved SNR
2
and showed better
performance compared to the template-based method. This
shows the robustness of our method since it is effective
even in open tests which means that test data is completely
different from the training data. In the case of Robovie-W,
the improvement was 3.9dB. However the recorded sound
R2 sounds noisier than Hearbo, which might be caused by
a longer distance between the speaker and the robot. For
the template-based method, the use of a larger number of
templates results in better performance in the closed tests
shown in Tab. II. However, in the open test, a small number
of templates had the best performance. This supports our
claim that the same motion does not always generate the
same ego-motion noise, and they are not fully correlated.
The result for D5 was different from other cases, and we
guess that this is caused by the shortage of training data.
The proposed method also has a problem. Because the
search space to feature estimation becomes large due to
the introduction of a non-parametric approach, it sometimes
results in a local solution. We should Þnd a way to relax this
problem, e.g., by using annealing methods for future work.
V. CONCLUSION
We presented a new ego-motion noise suppression method
with a single microphone which does not use any joint
status information and any additional sensors. The proposed
method Þrst estimates features for ego-motion noise using
InÞnite Non-negative Matrix Factorization and then a noise
suppressed target signal is obtained with Semi-Blind INMF
(SB-INMF) by using the estimated ego-motion noise features
as given features. Since it is free from non-linear process-
ing, the noise-suppressed signal is less distorted compared
to spectral subtraction methods. The effectiveness of the
proposed method was shown using two types of humanoid
robots. Future work includes the construction of an on-line
system, improvement in stability of the proposed method,
andvalidationoftheproposedmethodwithautomaticspeech
recognition.
