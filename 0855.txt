AbstractÑIn designing robot control systems, simulation is 
still the primary approach to verifying the functions of circuit 
descriptions written in hardware design language. The validity 
of the verification depends on the coverage metric. But not all 
state spaces can be specified in a simulation. Model checking can 
overcome the shortcomings of simulation, because all of the state 
spaces can be traversed. Robot control system is an important 
part of the robot, used in the control of the manipulator to 
perform specific tasks. Therefore, in this paper a verification 
framework is presented for design correctness of robotic 
manipulator, which combines simulation and model checking. 
The framework is also applied to other control system or control 
hardware. Model checking guides the generating of test vectors, 
and makes the functional coverage reach 100% quickly. In this 
paper, a manipulator   designed with six degrees of freedom is 
verified.  The results of the verification of the manipulator show 
that the verification framework is effective for checking the 
design correctness of robotic manipulator. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
The development of robots is the way of the future, and the   
safety and security of control system is a prerequisite for the 
development of robotic applications. For example, the 
manipulator is used in the application of the surgical systems. 
It must make sure that the manipulator with flexibility and 
safety. Therefore, validation work remains crucial in the 
design of robot control systems. Simulation-based verification 
is the primary approach in the industry due to the tractability 
and usability of the simulation process [1]. The process of 
simulation involves several steps, such as test generation and 
response evaluation, but functional coverage is central to all 
of the steps in the simulation process [2]. The size of the   
functional coverage determines the quality of the verification. 
As functional verification occupies most of the time in the 
verification cycle [3], many test vectors are required to 
simulate during in verification. With the commonly used 
method, it is difficult for functional coverage to achieve 100%

in a short time. Therefore, how to write a high -quality test 
vector to verify all of the defined functions in the shortest 
amount of time possible, shorten the development cycle, and   
improve the efficiency of verification presents a challenge to 
verification engineer. 
The basic idea of mode checking [4] is to describe the 
system state transition structure using the Finite State Machine 
(FSM) and indicate the nature of the design with temporal 
logic formulas. Mathematical methods are used to verify 
designs, in order to ensure all possible cases for authentication 
and make up the shortcomings that the simulation test vectors 
cannot all address.  
The current literature on coverage metrics focuses on 
formal verification [5], [6].These approaches consider the 
coverage property that is generated for each important signal. 
There are also various studies on function coverage [7], [8] in   
simulation, where the coverage is increased by using a fault 
insertion method. Recently, [9] proposed a technique that 
integrates the characteristics of both simulation and formal 
verification for complex hardware designs, but the calculation 
process of the technique is complex, and the definition of a 
functional simulator is not completely. In software 
development, there are also methods to find counterexample 
using model checker, [10] proposed a method to derive test 
sequences based on requirements specification, also [11] 
described a method about how to formalize the common 
structural coverage criteria from the formal framework and 
how to use the criteria to provide test sequences to achieve the 
coverage. Current research on robot, many of them is about 
planning problem [12]-[15]. Of course, there are also some 
research on robot control system, [16] proposed a method for 
designing controllers that provide guarantee on the stability 
and safety, and [17] proposed a method to continuum robotic 
manipulator design and actuation. 
In this paper, we focus on verification based on the register 
transfer level designing. We propose a verification framework 
that combines simulation and model checking for the 6DOF 
manipulator, the framework is also applied to other control 
system or control hardware. We can find a set of test stimuli 
by model checking that generate counterexample, so that the 
functional coverage can quickly reach 100%, with the 
coverpoints including any signal that one wishes to verify. We 
accomplished the verification, which refers to all aspects of 
the validation process and shows that the verification 
framework is effective for checking the design correctness of 
6DOF manipulator through an analysis of the results of the 
verification.

Fig. 1. The work flowchart 
The framework integrates two kinds of verification tools: 
the simulation tool Questasim (Mentor Graphics Corporation) 
[18] and the model checking tool SMV [19]. The work 
flowchart is shown in Fig. 1. Not only can one carry out 
simulation and formal verification simultaneously for DUT 
(Design Under Test) and give validation results, but the main 
function is to find the test vector that enables the functional 
coverage to reach 100% in the shortest possible time. First, a 
random test vector, verilog code and functional coverpoint for 
simulation are added to the simulation tool. If all of the 
defined functional coverpoints are covered during in the 
initial simulation, the verification is at an end. If the functional 
coverage does not reach 100%, we should translate the 
uncovered functional coverpoint into Computation Tree 
Logic [2], [20], [21]. Second, the CTL formula is put into 
SMV for formal verification in order to get one 
counterexample. If the formal verification result is false, this 
means that the design does not satisfy the attribute in 
specification. Meanwhile, SMV will give one counterexample, 
but this counterexample is not what we need to achieve 100% 
coverage. WhatÕs more, we should modify the design because 
of the false result; If the formal verification result is true, this   
means that the design satisfies the attribute, in other word, we 
can find a path that the design satisfies the formula by formal 
verification, and then illustrates the coverpoint can be covered 
in theory. In order to obtain the path from SMV, the CTL 
formula should be negated. Then formal verification should 
be carried out again with the negated formula. This time, we 
will get a counterexample that does not satisfy the negated 
attribute formula. Finally, the counterexample should be 
added to the test vector set and the simulation should be run 
again. Repeating steps 3-6, we will find all of the 
corresponding test vectors to enable functional coverage to 
quickly reach 100%. 
Step_1: Define the functional coverpoints. 
Step_2: Generate test vectors. 
Step_3: Carry out the simulation. If the functional coverage   
reaches 100%, then execute step 7. If does not reach 100%, go 
on to the next step. 
Step_4: Formulate the functional coverpoint that is not 
covered in initial simulation into CTL formula p for formal 
verification. If the result is not correct, this means that an error 
is found, and you should modify the design. If the result is 
correct, go on to the next step. 
Step_5: Negate property formula p, and carry out formal 
verification again, go on to the next step. 
Step_6: Add the counterexample into test vector set, 
executive step 3. 
Step_7: Validation is complete.  
In the Simulator, we should add to Verilog code, Test 
vector and Functional coverpoint. The Functional coverpoint 
comes from the Design. The simulation tool Questasim 
statistical coverage and gives out the coverage report.  
In the Model checker, we should add to the SMV model and 
the attribute formula. The SMV model comes from Verilog 
code. And the CTL formula refers to Specification and 
uncovered functional point. We should carry out formal 
verification for twice. We add to CTL formula in Model 
checker for verification for the first time, the Model checker 
will give out a result. And we should add to the negated CTL 
in Model checker again, but before we negate the CTL 
formula, we should ensure that the CTL formula is correct in 
the verification for the first time. This time the Model checker 
will give out a counterexample. We add the counterexample to 
the test vector set for a simulation. 
A.   Definition of Functional Coverpoint  
The functional coverage model to measure simulation tests 
is the central part of the validation process. Only a functional 
coverage model that accurately reflects the behavior of the 
design can be considered fully verified. In [2], one method is 
presented that can automatically generate coverage models, a 
property that is described using the CTL formula. A functional 
coverage group contains one or more coverage points. 
Coverage points specify what integer expression is to be 
covered. Each coverpoint includes a set of bins on the sampled 
value of the expression or hopping cover positions. Coverage 
bins can be either explicitly specified by the user or generated 
automatically by systemverilog [22]. The coverage point 
expression is calculated to occur in the coverage group 
sampling time. The expression can be calculated in the 
process of providing the context. The expression can be 
accessed via a legitimate virtual interface. Functional 
coverage is particularly important in random tests. In this 
paper, functional coverage is defined as follows: 
FC = 
points function tested all
points tion (TEST)func passed all
 
Generally, whether in direct testing or random testing, a   
verification plan will specify which function point needs to be   
4263
 
 
 
tested. In direct testing, a test case may correspond to a 
particular function point, so in many cases, regression testing 
requires all test vectors to reach the validation requirements. 
In random testing, a test case may be tested to different 
function points or one part of these points. Therefore, a 
specific measure is required. Generally, in accordance with 
the safety characteristics [17] and protocol requirements for 
robot verification or other manipulator, the definition of a 
functional coverpoint can refer to the following aspects [23]: 
Functional requirements, Interface Requirements, System 
Specification, and Protocol Specification. A specific 
verification plan may appear as: whether the FIFO overflows 
or gives an empty reading, the value of the output, state 
transition relations, as well as other regulatory requirements. 
The definition of coverpoint is shown in the following 
example: 
bit [1:0] s0; 
covergroup g4; 
cover1: coverpoint s0 iff (!reset); 
endgroup 
g4 g4_1 = new(); 
The covergroup shows that if and only if the value of reset is 
low, and the value of the (!reset)  holds true, will the 
coverpoint cover1 produce a statistic for s0.  
B.   The Generating of Test Vectors 
Generating test vectors is a very important component of 
verification [24]. Test vectors can usually be generated 
through several ways: 1) a directed test; 2) a directed random 
test; and 3) a random test. For each stimulus generator strategy, 
the test space covered range is different, as shown in Fig. 2. A 
directed test is more suitable for a simple design. Because of 
its relatively small test space, we can cover the space with a 
certain number of tests. A directed test can also be used to test 
simple function points in a complex design, particularly some 
of the possible boundary conditions for potential defects. A 
random test can be applied to any type of design, especially in 
designs with a relatively large test space, or to a large number 
of interactive case properties. Because verification engineers 
cannot list all function points, it is important to hit an 
undesired functional coverpoint by using a random test.  Some 
unusual random test stimuli can be created to test the design of 
unique and complex behavior for concurrent or asynchronous 
events. Computer systems introduce random numbers with a 
pseudo-random test generator, but these are pseudo-random 
numbers and not true random numbers [25]. Therefore, for 
complex chip designs, even though the stochastic method can 
usually verify most of the function points, it is necessary to 
manually add a direct stimulus to supplement the test vector 
set in order to verify all functional coverpoints and reduce the 
development of test cases. 
C.   Formulation of Functional Coverpoints 
The Calculate Logic Tree formula is used to describe the 
nature of the system. In [26] and [27], the syntax and semantic 
definitions of the logic formula CTL are described in detail. 
The formulation of functional coverpoint in this paper is 
mainly aimed at finding a counterexample. But unfortunately, 
not all coverpoints can be formulated into CTL, like 
coverpoint which describes the changing of dataflow, it is not 
easy to describe it and even if we get a counterexample, it may 
not be able to make the functional coverage reached 100%. In 
order to get a counterexample we need, we negate the CTL 
formula, which mainly comes from equivalent formula and the 
principle of model checking [28]. Before we negate the CTL, 
the CTL formula must be validated in the SMV and get the 
correct result. In [29], there are several commonly used CTL 
formulas for digital IC verification. 
In accordance with the requirements of the definition of a 
functional coverpoint, the expression of coverpoint can often 
be defined as the state transition and the change in the values 
of the variable. We can find a path that meets both the formula 
for the attributes and the formal formula for the property. 
Therefore, the problem of solving the functional point 
corresponds to the problem of finding the path. In the design 
of the 6DOF manipulator, we formulate part of the 
coverpoints as follows: 
a) When the status register satisfy a certain value, it can 
make the start signal start_flag a high level. So, the design 
requirements of the signal start_flag must be true at some 
point in the future, that is the expression (start_flag = 1) is true. 
The problem can be described in all paths and all states, there 
must exist a path (start_flag = 1) that will be true in a future 
time, with the specific formula being expressed as: AG EF 
(start_flag=1); 
b) The functional point start_flag_1 iff ((start_reg [1] = 1) 
& rst_n) indicates that if and only if ((start_reg [1] = 1) & 
rst_n) is true will there be coverage statistics for start_flag_1. 
The formula will be formulated to the attribute AG ((start_reg 
[1] = 1) & rst_n -> AF start_flag_1). 
III.  VERIFICATION PROCESS 
The function of the design is that the manipulator grabs an 
object and move from the starting point to the ending point. 
The whole process can be divided into two parts, involving the 
control model and manipulator movement model. The 
function of control module is shown in Fig. 3, and the data 
flowchart between steering engines is shown in Fig. 4. We 
should power on the manipulator to make it into the state of 
initialization and wait for the input commands (keyboard, 
wireless remote control, network, etc.). Use the input 
command of keyboard in which key1 achieves the movement 
of gripping objects and key2 realizes the reversal, acceleration 
and deceleration of a few simple steering engines. After 
receiving the work order, the manipulators start moving. The 
manipulator get initiated and move to the designated starting 
point A. Decline the manipulator to grab the objects then 
control the steering engine to lift manipulator and move to the 
ending point B, put down the objects, lift again. Repeat the 
above process. 
 The steering engine6 conduct base rotary and after 
reaching the position of target object, it gives the next 
operation command answer_output_6; After receiving the 
command of steering engine6, steering engine5 conducts the 
rotation of arm. Then it gives the operation command 
answer_output_5; After receiving the command of steering 
engine5, steering engine4 conducts the rotation of forearm. 
4264
 
 
 
Then it gives the operation command answer_output_4; After 
receiving the operation command answer_output_4, steering 
engine3 conducts the wrist rotation. Then it gives the 
operation command answer_output_3; After receiving the 
command of steering engine3, steering engine2 conducts the 
back of the wrist. Then it gives the operation command 
answer_output_2; After receiving the command of steering 
engine2, steering engine1 grab the objects and close. Then it 
gives the operation command answer_output_1; After 
receiving the command answer_output_1, steering engine5, 
steering engine4 and steering engine3 conduct three-arm 
linkage simultaneously to lift the manipulator and give the 
operation command answer_output_3_1, answer_output_4_1 
and answer_output_5_1. At last, in order to output the signal 
pwm_answer_output_1_345, we should make the signal 
answer_output_3_1, answer_output_4_1 and 
answer_output_5_1 to conduct the operation of logical AND 
on the top floor. After receiving the command of 
pwm_answer_output_1_345, steering engine6 conducts the 
movement of base rotary. Then it gives the command 
pwm_answer_output_6_1.  It will rotate when the ADD 
module is triggered now, it will control the exercise time by 
changing the value of the counter (HL+/-20Õd250), in order to 
achieve acceleration and deceleration. We can take steering 
engine6 for example, and the mechanism is shown in Fig. 5.

A. Definition of Functional Coverpoint 
For 6DOF manipulator, the main functional coverpoints 
that are   defined include the following aspects: 
1. The relationship between I/O ports: The direct input 
signals are key1 and key2 in the top module, while the output 
signals pwm_pulse_1, pwm_pulse_2, pwm_pulse_3, 
pwm_pulse_4, and pwm_pulse_5, represent the results under 
the input excitation signal. The functional coverpoints that 
need to be defined include four combinations of the input 
signal and the true and false values of the five output signals. 
For example: coverpoint pwm_pulse_5 {bins t = {0,1}}. 
2. The changing of the register value: In accordance with 
the timing requirements, the counter reads the value of the key 
once every 20ms. The value to be inputted into the register, 
the register maximum overflow value cannot exceed 2
20
. The 
reversible flag register and the flip angle are limited to the 
maximum value of 2
20
 and 2
31
, respectively. For example: 
coverpoint pwm_6 iff (cnt2<=20ÕdFFFFF). 
3. The data flow between the steers: These steers transmit 
signals with each other by the input and output of adjacent 
modules. These main functional coverpoints monitor   the 
interfaces between six modules so that they will be able to 
complete the whole movement. For example: coverpoint 
pwm_answer_output_1_345 iff (pwm_answer_output_3_1 & 
pwm_answer_output_4_1 & pwm_answer_output_5_1). This 
mean that, when completed the wrist rotation, the back of the 
wrist, grab the object and close, it must make sure the signal 
pwm_answer_output_1_345 is true, so that we can judge 
whether the grab success. This is the function of the design 
must satisfy. 
4. Design Requirements: The base rotation can only act 
directly on the arm, but cannot act on other joints because of 
the relationship between the joints and the 6DOF manipulator. 
Similarly, the arm can only drive the forearm, the forearm 
drives the wrist rotation, the wrist rotation drives the back of 
the wrist, and the wrist rotation has directly affects the grab. 
Once the object is grabbed, the arm, forearm and wrist should 
be rotated simultaneously. Therefore, those function points 
need to be monitored for independence between non-adjacent 
modules. For example: coverpoint ((cnt2 = 31'd0) && (HL = 
20'd40000) && (answer_output_1 = 0) && 
(answer_output_1_1 = 0)). 
B. The Generating of Test Vectors 
In this paper, we define the test vectors by first taking them 
at random in the testbench. A random test vector is generated 
by a random function, but in this case we cannot get enough 
test vectors by the random function alone to make the 
functional coverage reach 100%. We find some uncovered 
functional points, like the functional point (!start_flag_1), that 
is still uncovered even though the simulation time lasts to 2
40
 
(ns/ps) in the random simulation. Therefore, in order to cover 
these uncovered points, we need find tests with our 
verification framework. 
C.  Formulation of Functional Coverpoints 
We need some kind of special test vectors to test the 
boundary value. But, first, we need to prove that the function 
point is true, that is the design has completed the realization of 
the function. And the function points are not been covered in 
the simulation, because of the lack of test vectors. Yet, in this 
4265
 
 
 
case, there are three points uncovered during in the simulation, 
see Table 2. The first function point means when the reset 
signal is valid or shut off the power, even if register values 
((cnt2 == 31'd0) && (HL =20'd40000)) reached the execution 
conditions, steering engine 1 was unable to complete grab 
objects and closed movement ((answer_output_1 
=0)&&(answer_output_1_1 = 0)). The second point means 
the steering engine cannot be started (!start_flag_1). And the 
third point means that when the reset signal is invalid and has 
a button to press (start_reg [1]==1), steering engine can be 
started(start_flag_1). 
We should prove that these paths to which the points 
correspond are the exit. Practice has shown that such paths 
exist in SMV. Therefore, we can formulate the coverpoints to 
the CTL, such as AG EF !start_flag_1.Then, the CTL should 
be modified in such a way as to negate the CTL in order to get 
counterexample. Therefore, we modify the CTL to AG AX 
start_flag_1. That the functional point start_flag_1 is the exit 
is proved in SMV. Thus, we can get the counterexamples if 
only we put this property into SMV. 
D. The Results of Verification 
According to the requirements of ? .A, we basically 
completed the definition of all the functional coverpoints. In 
the process of random simulation, functional coverage change 
over time is shown in Table 1. From Table 1, we find that it is 
difficult to hit some functional coverpoints with purely 
random excitation. Therefore, in this paper we combine 
simulation and model checking, and transform the functional 
coverpoints that are not covered into CTL. We formulate 
these uncovered coverpoints into CTL, and negate them, and 
get some counterexamples in model checking, add these 
counterexamples into test vector set and make the coverage 
reached 100% at last.  All of the processes are shown in Table 
2 and Table 3. From Table 2 and Table 3 we find that when the 
simulation time is 2
34
 (ns/ps) in the initial stage, it is difficult 
to get a higher level of coverage. With our verification 
framework, we can find valid test vectors to make the 
functional coverage reach 100% in a very short time.

?.  CONCLUSION 
In this paper, we presented a framework of model checking 
guided test vector generation that combines simulation and 
model checking. The framework can enable functional 
coverage to rapidly reach 100%. The 6DOF manipulator grab 
object is verified in the verification framework, and 
constitutes the entire verification process. In this process, the 
formulation of functional coverpoint was difficult, not much 
work had yet been done. Meanwhile, the definition of 
functional coverpoints is the key problem. In the application 
of the verification framework, only by ensuring that the 
definition of functional coverpoints and the formulation of 
functional point are correct, can the verification framework be 
given full play. In future research work, we will strive to 
achieve automated verification. For now, it is more important 
to note that the verification framework requires more complex 
examples to fully explain its effectiveness and efficiency.
