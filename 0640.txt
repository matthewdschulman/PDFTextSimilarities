Abstract—We discuss grasp stability under gravity where
each ﬁnger makes soft-ﬁnger contact with an object. By
clustering polygon models of a ﬁnger and an object, the
contact area between a ﬁnger and an object is obtained as the
common area between an object cluster and a ﬁnger cluster.
Then, by assuming the Winkler elastic foundation, the pressure
distribution within the contact area is obtained. By using this

I. INTRODUCTION
Grasp stability is widely used as an index for evaluating
the grasping posture of multiﬁngeredhands. If grasp stability
is satisﬁed, we can guarantee that the grasped object can
resist an external disturbance from any direction. In this
study, we focus on grasp stability for general multiﬁngered
hands, wherein a ﬁnger makes soft-ﬁnger contact (SFC) with
an object. We consider solving formulating grasp stability
underSFC by explicitlyusing the pressuredistributionacting
in the contact area between ﬁnger and object. In addition to
this problem, we obtain the quality measure by taking the
effect of gravity into consideration.
Many industrial manipulators are equipped with two-
ﬁngered parallel grippers at the tip. For such manipulators,
it is well known that, if a ﬁnger contacts an object under
the point contact with friction (PCwF), three ﬁngers are
neededtoensuregraspstability.However,manytwo-ﬁngered
grippers have a ﬂexible sheet attached to the ﬁnger surface.
When a ﬁnger contacts an object, the ﬂexible sheet deforms,
thereby generating torsional friction at the contact area.
Because of this torsional friction, grasp stability can be
satisﬁed even if a hand has only two ﬁngers. This contact
style is called SFC. Here, because the amount of torsional
friction depends on the area of contact, grasp stability also
depends on the area of contact. Although the area of contact
depends on the object shape and the ﬂexibility of the sheet,
there has been no research on grasp stability under SFC in
which the effect of object shape and ﬂexibility of the sheet
has been considered. On the other hand, we determine grasp
stability under SFC by explicitly considering this effect. We

assume that polygon models are given for both a ﬁnger and
an object. By clustering the polygon models, we obtain the
contact area as the common area between a ﬁnger cluster
and an object cluster. Then, by assuming the Winkler elastic
foundation[13], the pressure distribution acting at the contact
area is obtained. By using the pressure distribution, we
evaluate grasp stability under SFC.
For the problem of quality measure, a grasp has to be
kept under gravity. Here, let us consider a situation in which
a set of grasping postures is generated without knowledge
of the direction of the gravitational force acting on an object
before the grasp is executed. Then, an object is actually
grasped by selecting one feasible grasping posture from a
set of candidate postures generated in advance. To cope
with this situation, the grasp quality has to be set such that
a grasp is maintained under gravity while the direction of
gravity is unknown. We consider a three-dimensional subset
of the six-dimensional wrench set. Then, we consider a
three-dimensional sphere where its radius is the same as the
amount of gravitational force and whose center is located at
the origin. If this sphere is included in the three-dimensional
subset, we judge that grasp stability is maintained.
This paper is organized as follows: After describing some
previous work in Section 2, we formulate the region of force
and the moment when a ﬁnger applies a force to an object in
Section 4. In Section 5, we formulate grasp stability under
gravity. In Section 6, we conﬁrm the effectiveness of the
proposed approach through several numerical examples.
II. RELATED WORK
Because grasp stability is a classical robotics problem,
much research has been conducted on it[1], [2], [3], [4], [5],

[6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], but mostly it has been assumed
that a ﬁnger contacts an object under PCwF. Herem the well-
known quality measure proposed by Ferrari and Canny[1]
has been commonly used in many research projects. The
amount of research on grasp stability under SFC however
is limited. Howe and Cutkosky[12] proposed force-motion
models under SFC. Ciocarlie et al.[9] examined grasp sta-
bility under SFC. However, they assumed the area of contact
to be an ellipsoid of ﬁxed size. In our previous research[14],
we discussed grasp stability under SFC by approximatingthe
contact area by an ellipsoid. Meanwhile, research on contact
elasticity has a long history[13], and some researchers have
tried to model the elasticity of contact when a robotic hand
grasps an object[17], [18], [19].
As far as we know, ours is the ﬁrst general algorithm to be
developed for grasp stability under SFC, in which the effect
of object shape and the ﬂexibility of the contact have been
taken into consideration.
III. DEFINITIONS
Let us consider a situation in which an object is being
graspedby a multiﬁngeredhand.Let us also considerthat the
ﬁnger surface contacting an object is deformable, whereas
the object surface is rigid. We assume that the shape of the
ﬁnger contactingsurface is ﬂat when there is no deformation.
Let f
i
and ?
i
(i=1,...,m) denote the force and moment,
respectively, applied at the ith contact point of an object.
?
ni
and ?
ti
denote the normal and tangential components
of ?
i
, respectively. For SFC, the force and moment about
the contact normal are applied by a ﬁnger to an object. The
wrench ? applied to an object by all ﬁngers is expressed by

In this research, we assume that polygon models are given
for both the ﬁnger and the object. Under this assumption, we
obtain the contact region on the object surface by clustering
the polygon models. Let C

IV. SOFT-FINGER CONTACT
We formulate grasp stability under SFC.
A. Overview

case in which the relation between the contact force and the
moment about the contact normal at the ith contact point can
be expressed in the following form[12]:

where the eccentricity parameter e

of friction ellipsoid
changes depending on the object shape and the area of
contact. Equation (2) has to be satisﬁed for a multiﬁngered
hand to maintain the grasp on an object under SFC. Here,
the parameter e
ni
will be calculated in the following; an
overview is roughly depicted in Fig. 2.
As shown in Fig. 2, we ﬁrst consider the case where a
graspingpostureis given.We obtainthecontactareabetween
the ﬁnger and the object by clustering the polygon model of
the object. Then, by assuming the Winler elastic foundation,
the pressure distribution within the contact area is obtained
depending on the amount of deformation. Once the pressure
distribution is obtained, we can calculate the parameter e
ni
by integrating the pressure distribution within the contact
area.
B. Object Surface Clustering
Let us consider the situation in which a rigid object pen-
etrates a rigid ﬁnger with a ﬂat surface. This approximately
expressesa situation in whicha ﬁngersurface deformsowing
to contact with an object. Let h
max
be the penetration depth
corresponding to the amount of deformation of the ﬁnger
surface.
The contact region between the ﬁnger and the object can
be obtained from the region on the object surface penetrated
by the ﬁnger. This region can be obtained by clustering the
polygon model, as explained in the following.
First, we obtain a grasping posture without taking the
deformation of the ﬁnger surface into consideration. Here,
˜ p
i
denotes the position vector of the ith grasping point.
Let the tilde of cluster
˜
C
j
denote that this cluster includes
the position vector ˜ p. From an initial set of clusters, our
clustering algorithm merges a neighboring cluster to cluster
˜
C
j
provided the maximum distance from the point denoted
by ˜ p to an arbitrary point included in
˜
C
j
in the direction n
j
is less than h
max
. Among multiple neighboring clusters, we
consider selecting the one whose normal vector is closest to

As for each ﬁnger, ﬂat area on ﬁnger surface is limited.
To obtain the boundary of ﬂat area on ﬁnger surface, we also
cluster the polygon model of each ﬁnger link contacting with
an object.
After clustering the polygon model of an object, we
consider obtaining the cluster’s outer boundary projected
onto the plane including the ﬁnger surface. The contact
area on the object surface can be obtained by taking the
common area between the boundary of the ﬁnger surface
and the boundary of the object cluster projected onto the
plane including the ﬁnger surface. We regard this common
area as the contact area in this research.
C. Pressure Distribution
By using the contact area obtained in the previous subsec-
tion, we now obtain the pressure distribution within the con-
tact area based on the Winkler elastic foundation[13]. From
the Winkler elastic foundation, we can obtain a simpliﬁed
model of the pressure distribution by disregarding the effect
of shear stress.
As shown in Fig. 4, let us consider the coordinate system
attached at the ﬁnger surface without deformation where

the above equations, the parameter e

be calculated as[9]

. (6)
We can now deﬁne Eq. (2) at each contact point.
V. GRASP STABILITY UNDER GRAVITY
To deﬁne the grasp wrench set (GWS), we allow Eq. (2) to
act as a constraint on the force and moment at each contact
point denoted as (f
i
,?
ni
) ? SFC. It is known that there
are two major deﬁnitions of the GWS: One is obtained by
using the Minkowski sum and the other is obtained by the
union of unit wrenches[1]. Although our grasp quality can
be deﬁned for both cases, we deﬁne the GWS by using the
Minkowski sum as follows[10]:

We now deﬁne the quality measure. As mentioned in
the Introduction, we consider the situation in which grasp
stability has to be maintained under gravity and the direction
of gravity is unknown. Our quality measure is a modiﬁed
version of Ferrari and Canny’s method[1].
An overview of the proposed method is shown in Fig. 5.
Let ?=(?

ofathree-dimensionalforceandathree-dimensionalmoment
acting on an object. Here, without loss of generality, we
consider the case where the origin of the object coordinate
system coincides with the center of gravity. The ﬁgure on

an object deﬁned by Eq. (7). We consider obtaining the
following intersection:
W
int

ch
L
∞ ? W
?
, (8)
where W
?
={?|?

=0}. We call this intersection the GWS
intersection. In the GWS intersection, we consider a sphere
whose center is located at the origin and whose radius is mg,
where m is the weight of the object. If this sphere is included
inside the GWS intersection, we judge that the stability is
maintained. In our method, the grasp quality Q is deﬁned
as the minimum distance from the origin to the boundary of
the GWS intersection. Because Q>mg is always satisﬁed,
we can guarantee that the grasp can be maintained against
the gravitational force from any direction.
Here, as in many methods of grasp quality measure, the
friction cone is approximated by using a convex cone[1],
[9], [10]. In [9], a method involving the use of convex
polyhedrons to approximate the region deﬁned by Eq. (2)
for SFC was shown. Although our method can be directly
applied for Eq. (2) approximated by convex polyhedrons,we
consider using a method in which the GWS is deﬁned by a
common area of multiple ellipsoids[11].
As for the quality measure obtained in this section, the
conventional deﬁnition[1] does not consider the effect of
object mass. Let us consider the case where a multiﬁngered
hand grasps a long bar. For this case, although we can
expect that grasp is not stable if a hand grasps the edge
of a bar, we need information on the object mass and the
position of center of gravity to determine the grasp quality.
As showninthesectionofnumericalexamples,we will show
an example of grasping a long bar by using a two-ﬁngered
parallel gripper.
VI. DISCUSSION
Our proposed algorithm of calculating the contact area
becomes accurate if the polygon model is ﬁne enough and
if the effect of share stress is small enough. Here, if the
effect of share stress is large, the actual contact area will
be smaller than our calculation result. Hence, assuming that
the approximation of friction constraint (eq.2) is accurate
enough, we expect that the grasp stability obtained by
our algorithm will tend to be more stable than the actual
cases. The grasp stability of SFC with large share stress is
considered to be our future research topic.

Our clustering algorithm cannot deal with the case where
there are two bumps on the object surface simultaneously
contacting with the ﬁnger surface. This is also considered to
be our future research topic.
VII. NUMERICAL EXAMPLES
To show the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we
show several numerical examples. The number of polygons
of object used in this section is shown in Table VII. We ﬁrst
calculate the contact area and e
ni
deﬁned in Eq. (2) for three
cases. In all three cases, we set ?=0.8, f

=15 N, and
h
max
=0.001 m. The results of our calculations are listed in
Table VII. Graphics for our numerical examples are shown
in Figs. 6, 7, and 8. In these ﬁgures, the yellow and red
areas represent the cluster and contact areas, respectively.
Although the same PET bottle is grasped, the contact area
shown in Fig. 7 is larger than that shown in Fig. 6. Hence,
the parameter e
n
in Fig. 7 is larger than that in Fig. 6.
Next, we show an example of changing the amount of

.We
consider changing h

in proportion to f

. The result is
shown in Table II and Fig. 9. As seen, as h
max
decreases,
the contact area also decreases. The quality measure also
decreases and becomes unstable when h
max
=0.001 m.
We measured the calculation time needed to cluster the
polygon model. By using a 3.33-GHz PC, the calculation
time is about 0.26 s in all cases. This result shows that our
method is practical enough to be used in most existing grasp
planners.
Finally, we show the quality measure of grasping a
rectangular-shaped object with a uniform mass distribution.
In this example, we ﬁxed e
ni
to 0.1. Because of torsional
friction, we can expect that the grasp to become less stable
if the grasping position gets far from the center of gravity.

VIII. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORKS
In this paper, we proposed a method for judging grasp
stability under SFC. To formulate grasp stability, we ﬁrst
obtained the contact area by clustering the polygon model
of an object. Then, by using the Winkler elastic foundation,
we deﬁned the set of the force and the moment applied
to an object by a ﬁnger. We further deﬁned the quality
measure as an intersection of the GWS and the set of zero
moment. Through several numerical examples, we showed
that, depending on the shape of an object and on the
deformation of the ﬁnger surface, grasp stability changes.
We also showed that our method is practical enough since
we can obtain the grasp stability in a short period of time.
