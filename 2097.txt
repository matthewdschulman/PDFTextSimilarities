Abstract? Possessing two manipulators heightens the ability
of dual-arm robots (DAR) to conduct complex tasks, while
raising hazard that the two manipulators might collide with
each other or with other objects. DARs are usually equipped
with a collision-free motion planning algorithms (CFMPA) to
prevent the two manipulators from colliding. The CFMPA
searches the motion paths of robot manipulators, which are
expected to be as short and smooth as possible under the
premise of ensuring safety. It is important to ensure that
the algorithm is correct and efcient. It is not enough to
apply traditional test methods to determine whether DARs
can work in safety-critical applications. In this paper, theorem
proving technology is employed to analyze the correctness and
efciency of a classical CFMPA. The CFMPA is outlined, and
then formalized in high order logic with the theorem prover
HOL4. An inconsistency in the range of motions of the robot
manipulators in the algorithm is discovered. An improved
algorithm is therefore proposed. Formal verication with HOL4
proves the correctness and efciency of the proposed algorithm
that has already run on a real DAR as well, in conformity with
our expectation.
I. INTRODUCTION
As scope of application of robots grows, the issue of
safety has become paramount. DARs can perform many
kinds of work requiring dexterity. Such work is executed by
dual manipulators. When a DAR is at work, there are two
manipulators moving simultaneously in the working area.
How to make the two manipulators cooperate with each other
and avoid colliding becomes a key problem. So CFMPA has
been proposed to address the problem. Now the new problem

is to verify the correctness and the efciency performance of
the CFMPA of dual arms robots.
Generally, designers try to ensure correctness by sim-
ulation and testing. The algorithm veried in this paper
was simulated when it was designed [1]. These methods
of verication are helpful and easy to use but not enough
because they cannot satisfy the security requirements in
relevant standards such as IEC 61508 [2]. Safety of algo-
rithms is established by the safety requirements, and the
conformance of the algorithm designs or implementations
with these must be veried [7]. Formal methods are rec-
ommended in some standards like IEC 61508 [2]. Formal
verication provides the mathematically rigorous, machine-
checked proof of the correctness of a program with respect
to the safety requirements. There are two main methods
of formal verication. One is model checking, which is
widely used in many research institutes to verify the motion
planning of robots. Jones et al. veried a receding horizon
algorithm for informative path planning with temporal logic
constraints [3]. Kress-Gazit et al. provided a framework to
automatically generate a hybrid controller that guarantees
that the robot can achieve its task when a robot model, a class
of admissible environments, and a high-level task or behavior
for the robot are provided [1]. Although model checking
possesses a high degree of automation, it is restricted by
the scale of the veried question and the expressive ability
because the state space explosion is inevitable and some
complex problem cannot be represented accurately. The other
method of formal verication is theorem proving, which has
a strong expressive ability to verify the correctness of a
particular algorithm, especially in high order logic. Meikle
proved Graham's scan algorithm in Isabelle's Hoare logic [5].
Taubig veried the safety area algorithm of an autonomous
robot in Isabelle/HOL [6]. To the best of our knowledge, this
is the rst time that the collision-free algorithm of a DAR
in HOL4 has been veried.
From a theorem proving perspective, CFMPA algorithms
are challenging, because they involve a lot of geometry
modeling the behavior of robot manipulators so sophisti-
cated mathematical domain model must be built in logic.
Mathematically, geometry is concerned with the properties
of subsets ofR
2
orR
3
. To capture these concepts formally,
expressive forms of logic such as set theory or higher-order
logic are required, as they allow us to formalize mathematics
involving numbers, lists, sets, vectors, matrix, and functions.
We use a general-purpose theorem prover built on higher-
order logic, HOL4, as the verication tool for our robotics
application.

HOL4 developed in Cambridge University is the latest
version of the HOL interactive proof assistant for higher
order logic. By the theorem prover, simple proof steps
could be run automatically, and users can concentrate on
the hard parts. The prover has mechanisms to allow for a
high degree of condence of the correctness of proofs than
paper-and-pencil proof methods do. Moreover the theorem
proving method requires users to deeply understand designs
or implementations and specications of systems. This is
helpful to uncover hidden faults which are apt to be missed
by tests and simulations. To describe the algorithm, we have
developed required foundation theorem libraries including
vector & matrix theories, function matrix theory, the Hoare
logic, separate logic and the weakest pre-predicate theorems
of Dijkstra in HOL4.
This paper is structured as follows. In Section II, we
sketch out the actual collision-free algorithm of a DAR. In
Section III, the formal domain is modeled and our approach
of specication and verication is given. In Section IV , a
semantic inconsistency in the algorithm is discovered, and
an improved method is provided and veried using a formal
method.
II. CFMPA FOR DARS
A CFMPA for a DAR is a collision avoidance algorithm,
which protects the two manipulators of the robot, allowing
for simultaneous movement in a plane without collision. In
this paper, a 2D horizontally articulated DAR (SCARATES
robot) [1], which is shown in Fig 1, is chosen as an instance
for the algorithm. The algorithm can also be applied to other
types of DARs. Each of the manipulators has two joints.

Fig. 1: The conguration structure of SCARATES
In robotics, the positions and orientations of rigid objects
are applied in a physical space are formulated as coordinate
parameters of a conguration space (C-space) which is, in
essence, a general space. The C-space of a rigid object in
real life has six degrees of freedom (d.o.f), three of which
describe the position of the rigid object, while the other three
describe the object's orientation. A rigid object that has a
specied position and orientation in physical space will be
converted to a specied point in the conguration space. The
C-space can be further divided into two subspaces: obstacle
space and free space. Obstacle space refers to the parts of
the C-space occupied by obstacles, and free space refers to
the parts of the C-space not occupied by obstacles. The C-
space is usually used for planning the motions of a rigid
object among stationary obstacles. However, in our work,
we adapt the method of C-space for collision-free motion
planning of DARs. The two manipulators form each other's
obstacle spaces in CFMPA.
The coordinates of the C-space are the angles of two joints
of the subordinate manipulator, and are noted as (q
R1
;q
R2
).
Suppose that the range of the angle of the joints is limited to
between 0 and 2p, and that the C-space of the subordinate
manipulator is expressed as: C
R
=f(q

)j0 q
R1


principal and the right as the subordinate. The limited rota-
tional velocities of the four joints of the robot are w

, w

,
w
L1
, w

respectively. The principal manipulator moves by
PTP from the start position (q

Output and guarantees. If the robot satises the assum-
ptions described above and the input parameters are corr-
ect, the algorithm guarantees the safety and correctness
of the optimal path. This means that the two manipulators
of the robot will always be able to move from the start
point to the goal point without collisions. More precisely,
no part of the manipulators will intersect.
III. FORMAL MODELING AND VERIFICATION
There are three components of our formalizing framework
for the CFMPA for DAR: the position of the joints, the C-
space obstacle boundary, and the structure of the algorithm.
All three components can be manipulated in the HOL4
theorem prover. We use the function matrix and vector theory
to represent the position of the joints, and set theory to
represent the C-space obstacle boundary. These two theories
as a whole are referred to as domain theory. In addition, we
use Hoare logic and the weakest pre-predicate of Dijkstra to
represent the structure of the algorithm. Then, we verify the
collision avoidance and function correctness in HOL4 in a
straightforward manner, based on our formalizing framework
in Fig.2.

This algorithm has two key properties: the safety and the
functional correctness. The safety of the algorithm represents
that the obstacle space of the principal manipulator and
subordinate manipulator cannot be overlapped at any time.
In the CFMPA, S
LArm
and S
RArm
denotes the obstacle space
of the principal manipulator and the subordinate manipulator
at the time of t respectively, while (q
R1
;q
R2
) characterizes
the position of the subordinate manipulator. The functional
correctness means that the algorithm can nd an optimal
path, shortest and smoothest, if the safety property can be
satised when the subordinate manipulator move from the
starting position to the goal position and otherwise returns
the failure message of the path searching. Meanwhile, we
must ensure that the algorithm can be terminated.
In order to formalize the obstacle space, we use the convex
polygon model to describe the S
LArm
and S
RArm
so that we
can employ intersection of the polygon to determine whether
the obstacle space is overlapped or not.
A. Convex Polygon Domain Modeling
For the space on which the algorithm is based is a subset
of R
2
, we can specify the point of the space in HOL4 as
follows.
val _=type_abbrev("Point",``:real[2]``);
So, many denitions and theorems concerning basic ge-
ometry can be directly transformed from textbook math to
HOL4. For every pair of points among the set called a
convex, every point on the line segment that joins them is
also in the set. In HOL4:
Denition 1: segment def:
segment(x :Point y :Point) :=
fz :Pointj9t :R: 0t 1^(z=tx+(t  1)y)g
Its type is Point!Point!Point set.
And the convex hull of a set Z is the smallest convex set
containing Z:
Denition 2: is convex def:
is convex(Z :Point set) :=
8x y :Point: x2Z^y2Z)segment x yZ
Its type is Point set!bool.
Denition 3: convex def:
convex(X :Pointset) :=\fYjis convex Y^XYg
Its type is Point set!Point set.
Using these denitions, many simple theorems can be
proven by just rewriting denitions.
In general, Graham's Scan is used to compute the convex
hull of a more complex set of points and the convex hull
represents the area to be described. In the proof of this paper,
the following two lemmas are used.
Convex monotone lemma could be formalized as follows:
Lemma 1: convex monotone:
8X Y(:Point set):XY)convex Xconvex Y
Convex union lemma could be formalized as follows:
Lemma 2: convex union:
8X Y(:Point set):(convex X[convex Y)convex (X[Y)
The CFMPA only involves a problem of collision avoid-
ance in 2D, so we only need to model the convex polygons.
We useR
2
to represent the type of points, hence the point set
is a function of R
2
!bool. But, in practice, the movement
1382
space of the arm robot is R
3
. We can easily extend the
domain model from 2D to 3D, simply by using R
3
and
R
3
! bool to respectively represent the point and point
set. Meanwhile the model is a convex polyhedron. In our
work, we extend the discussion to the model with the convex
polyhedron and use the overlapping of sets to describe the
collision of objects in 3D.
B. Verifying the Algorithm with a Formal Method
We verify the CFMPA applying Hoare logic. Hoare triples
are written asfPgCfQg, whereP andQ are assertions andC
is a program. In the CFMPA, a pair of collision-free optimal
paths will be automatically generated when the start position,
goal position and orientations of the two manipulators of
the DAR are given. There are two main steps to planning a
collision-free path: (1) conrm the database of the collision-
free state D
R
; (2) search the optimal collision-free path from
D
R
.
The function of step 3 in the CFMPA is conrming the
database of the collision-free state D
R
in Fig 3. Each of
the states in D
R
in Fig.3 is determined by whether the
obstacle spaces of the two manipulators are overlapping.
Each manipulator is simplied as the merger of two simple
convex polygons of its two joints, therefore the obstacle
space of one manipulator is the merged polygon of other
manipulator.
k = 0ÉN-1
j = 0Én-1
i = 0Ém-1
Fig. 3: The kth layer corresponds to the states of the all the
positions at each time of Dt, which is nominated as D
R;kDt
.
The state of the positions that correspond to light-colored
grid is 0, while state of the rest is 1. The state database D
R
is constructed by all the layers D
R;kDt
at each time of Dt,
which is D
R
=
N 1
S
k=0

R;kDt
.
Consider the Hoare triple:
Theorem 1:
fTg

f8(i j k) :N: k<N^i<m^ j<n)
P
i;j;k
=((SLarm
k
\SRarm
i;j;k
)=F! 0j1)g
where N is the determined natural numbers and m, and n
are the numbers that indicate that the C-space is divided.
(t!t
1
jt
2
) means that if t then t
1
else t
2
.
Based on the Hoare rules, Theorem 1 can easily be proven.
Therefore, Property 1 can also be proven.
Property 1:
8(i j k) :N: k<N^i<m^ j<n)
(P
i;j;k
= 0)(SLarm
k
\SRarm
i;j;k
)=F)^
(P
i;j;k
= 1)(SLarm
k
\SRarm
i;j;k
)<>F)
This means that there is no collision when the state is 0.
The function of step 4 of the algorithm is to search for
the optimal collision-free path from D
R
. The path is the
group of ordered coordinates that represent the position at
each respective time. The path can be denoted by list type.
In order to accurately describe step 5 in Hoare logic, we
designed the following denitions.
Whether a list is a path is dened as follows.
Denition 4: is path def:
is path(L :list;startp;goalp) :=
(L
0
=startp)^(L
LENGTH(L) 1
=goalp)^
8(i j k i

(k<N)P
k;i;j

N 1;i;j

The optimal path is the one with the smallest total distance
of movement and the smoothest direction. J1 and J2 are the
cost function in the algorithm.
Denition 5: optpath def:
optpath(startp;goalp) :=eLA:
is path(LA)^
(8L: is path(L))J1(LA)J1(L)^
(J1(LA)=J1(L))J2(LA)J2(L)))
where ex: t means that an x such that: t.
Then, the Hoare triple of step 4 can be expressed as
Theorem 2.
Theorem 2:
f8(i j k) :N: k<N^i<m^ j<n)

(i<m^ j<n^Nk<LENGTH(L))
optpath(startp;goalp)=L^L
k

N 1;i;j
= 0)g
Based on the denition of is path def, the properties of
path can be captured.
Since the path must start from the starting position and
end at the goal position, this property can be formalized as
follows.
Property 2:
8L :list startp goalp:
is path(L;startp;goalp))
(L
0
=startp)^(L
LENGTH(L) 1
=goalp)
In the path generated by the algorithm, each position of the
path is remarked as state 0. This property can be formalized
as follows.
1383
Property 3:
8(i j k) :N L :list startp goalp:
i<m^ j<n^k<N)
is path(L;startp;goalp)^L
k
=(i; j))P
k;i;j
= 0
If the principal manipulator reach the goal position while
the subordinate manipulator do not reach the goal position
yet, the obstacle space of the subordinate manipulator will
remain unchanged. Thus, we only need to search in the state
database of the last layer in Fig 3. Meanwhile, each position
of the path is remarked as state 0. This property can be
formalized as follows.
Property 4:
8(i j k) :N L :list startp goalp:
i<m^ j<n^Nk<LENGTH(L))
is path(L;startp;goalp)^L
k
=(i; j))P
N 1;i;j
= 0
Property 3 and property 4 show that the state of every
position in the path is 0.
Therefore, we can prove that the optimal path from the
start position to the goal position must be the path according
to the denition of optpath def.
Property 5:
8startp goalp:
is path(optpath(startp;goalp);startp;goalp)
Therefore, the state of the position in the optimal path
must be 0.
Property 6:
8(i j k) :N L :list startp goalp:
i<m^ j<n^k<N)
optpath(startp;goalp)=L^L
k
=(i; j))P
k;i;j
= 0
Property 7:
8(i j k) :N L :list startp goalp:
i<m^ j<n^Nk<LENGTH(L))
optpath(startp;goalp)=L^L
k
=(i; j))P
N 1;i;j
= 0
Theorem 2 can be proven on the basis of the above
theorems. It shows that all of the positions in the optimal
path searched by step 4 fromD
R
are collision-free. Moreover,
the result of the searching is the optimal path or a null list,
and the null list shows that there is no path from the start
position to the goal position.
Therefore, we can verify the path generated by the CFMPA
according to the above-mentioned properties. Based on the
HOL4 theorem prover, the correctness of the properties
has been proved. The proving process reveals that the path
generated by the CFMPA could be collision-free and optimal
if the control accuracy of the robot system is ensured.
C. A Semantic Inconsistency
Although the result of the proof demonstrates that the
path generated by the CFMPA can avoid the collision of
the manipulators, we nd from the proof that the theorem 2
does not need such a strong premise, which will lead to an
inefcient algorithm. The fundamental reason is that there
exists a semantic inconsistency in the CFMPA.
At the beginning of the algorithm, the path of the principal
manipulator is already planned and its direction of movement
is determined at each moment. However, when planning the
path of the subordinate manipulator, the algorithm considers
that each joint of the principal manipulator has two possible
directions of rotation: the clockwise and counterclockwise.
Therefore the domain that the principal manipulator will go
through in the next Dt, noted as S
LArm
, is limited to that
between the position (q
L1
 w
L1
Dt;q
L2
 w
L2
Dt) and (q
L1
+
w
L1
Dt;q
L2
+w
L2
Dt).
In fact, the rotation direction of the principal manipulator
is known. That is to say, the area that the principal manipula-
tor will sweep into in the nextDt, noted as S
0
LArm
, is a part of
S
LArm
. If the rotation directions of two joints of the principal
manipulator are both clockwise, S
0
LArm
is limited to between
the position (q
L1
;q
L2
) and (q
L1
+w
L1
Dt;q
L2
+w
L2
Dt). This
is an inconsistency relating to the range of movements of the
principal manipulator in the nextDt. Such an inconsistency in
the design of the algorithm has potential risks. Performance
could be greatly reduced and security could be threatened.
IV. VERIFYING THE MODIFIED ALGORITHM
A. Modifying the Algorithm
Firstly, according to the consistent requirement, we modify
the original algorithm. At every interval, the rotation direc-
tion of the principal manipulator can be read from its planned
path. So S
0
LArm
is computed within the ranges of domain.
if q
GL1
>q
SL1
then
fif q
GL2
>q
SL2
then
S
0
LArm
= f((q
L1
;q
L2
);(q
L1
+w
L1
Dt;q
L2
+w
L2
Dt))
else S
0
LArm
= f((q
L1
;q
L2
);(q
L1
+w
L1
Dt;q
L2
 w
L2
Dt))g
else
fif q
GL2
>q
SL2
then
S
0
LArm
= f((q
L1
;q
L2
);(q
L1
 w
L1
Dt;q
L2
+w
L2
Dt))
else S
0
LArm
= f((q
L1
;q
L2
);(q
L1
 w
L1
Dt;q
L2
 w
L2
Dt))g
Secondly, we can get the new domainS
0
LArm
, as the shadow
shown in Fig 4(b). In this light, S
0
LArm
is roughly equivalent
to the half of the original domain S
LArm

B. The Improvement of Performance
Similar to the verication of the original algorithm, we
use the Hoare triples to specify the modied algorithm.

The proving of these two theorems shows that the safety

Based on the precondition strength rule in Hoare logic,
Theorem 2 can be proven more easily.

Theorem 2 and 4 show the precondition of the modied
algorithm is weaker than the original. This means that the
modied algorithm can have higher efciency. This conclu-
sion is drawn as follows. With the modied algorithm, there
are more states the weights of which are 0 in the database

, so the optimal path is searched more easily; moreover
the cost of the manipulator's path is lower.
The improved algorithm has been tested in our experimen-
tal platform. The experiment shows that it is more efcient
than the previous algorithm. In addition, the improved al-
gorithm succeeds in searching especially in the conditions
where the previous one fails.
V. CONCLUSIONS
We presented a formal method to verify the CFMPA
of a DAR. A semantic inconsistency in the algorithm was
discovered. In addition, we present a modied algorithm
with the improvement of searching efciency and planning
success. That the modied algorithm is collision-free and is
more efcient, was veried using in HOL4.
In conclusion, we believe that formally proving the
collision-free algorithm in a theorem prover like HOL4 adds
condence in its correctness and we believe that this should
become an important stage in the process of developing such
algorithms. Despite the difculty of proving these algorithms
at present, we believe that the task will become easier as li-
braries of useful theories are built and a better understanding
of the eld is gained. Our work demonstrates how successful
Hoare logic can be for formalizing collision-free algorithms.
Not only does Hoare logic allow the formal specications to
resemble the algorithm, but it forces one to think carefully
about algorithms. Formalizing the properties of the algorithm
makes it easier to obtain a better understanding of it and
reveals situations that might have gone undetected. In this
algorithm, an inconspicuous inconsistency was revealed.
