AbstractÑThe drive mechanism of many robot joints are
composed of an electrical actuator and a gear transmission.
Besides actuator dynamics and gear elasticity, friction effects
are of particular importance for accurate dynamic modeling.
This paper presents the design and development of a modular
testbedforexperimentalfrictionidentiÞcationinmodularrobot
drives. We have used this testbed to investigate modules that
were developed at our institute for the humanoid robot Lola
and an agricultural manipulator. We discovered that a friction
law, similar to a law proposed in the literature, can be very
accurately Þtted to our measurements.
I. INTRODUCTION
The development of robot manipulators could hardly be
achieved without a dynamic simulation model to design
the electrical components and mechanical parts. The more
accurate the model, the more beneÞcial it can be for the
system design and realization of efÞcient control concepts.
For robotic manipulators, one common approach for the
design of a joint drive mechanism is the combination of
electrical actuators with high gear ratio transmissions. These
gears usually have a high amount of friction which must be
taken into account at the design stage and incorporated into
the dynamic model. Given the difÞculty of modeling friction
effects, usually the design engineer has to rely on speci-
Þcations provided by the gear manufacturer. Nevertheless,
under conservative assumptions, it is possible to successfully
design the system components. However, to further improve
the dynamic model and to evaluate the system design,
identiÞctaion on the real system is necessary. In this study,
the design of a testbed to experimentally investigate friction
effects in robotic drive modules is presented. Measurements
on modules, developed for the humanoid robot Lola as well
as measurements on a test joint, recently designed for an
agricultural manipulator (cf. Fig. 1) as part of the EU-project
CROPS, were conducted. This is easily possible since both
robots are designed out of integrated drive modules and
assembled at our institute. The paper is organized as follows.
In the next section, we give a short overview of related
work concerning friction identiÞcation, focusing particularly
on modeling HarmonicDrive gears. In Section III the set-up
and dynamic modeling of the drive modules is addressed.
Section IV describes the requirements, the design of the
testbed and the test procedure for the experimental friction

II. RELATED WORK
In the last decades, many researchers have worked on the
modeling and experimental identiÞcation of friction phenom-
ena in machinery. Nevertheless, according to [1], system
modeling, in particular modeling of friction effects, solely
based on catalog data will not lead to an accurate dynamic
model. An apparatus for experimental friction measurements
inbearings[2],[3]aswellasvariousexperimentalset-upsfor
parameter identiÞcation in HarmonicDrive gears are reported
in the literature. For friction identiÞcation in HarmonicDrive
gears it is common to Þt model parameter to measurements.
A basic experimental setup is composed of an electrical
actuator,drivingtheinputsideofthegearwiththepossibility
to Þxate the output shaft [1], [4]. In the work of [5], [6],
a testbed was designed with an inertia load on the output
side of the gear for unrestrained motion experiments. Note
that it is impossible with this set-up to represent arbitrary
load cases. Sometimes it is not easily possible to investigate
individual drive units of a robot (e.g. when buying an indus-
trial manipulator), in which case a parameter identiÞcation
must directly performed on the system as a whole [7],
[8]. The major friction loss in HarmonicDrive gears occurs
in the tooth-meshing of the circular and ßexspline. Other
effects comprise viscous damping of the wave generator and
ßexsplinebearings,aswellasstructuraldampingoftheßexs-
pline [6]. More detailed models consider position dependent
friction and inßuences of resonance vibration, due to higher
torques in the meshing [1]. A very detailed description of
HarmonicDrive gear modeling and experimental parameter
identiÞcation is given in [9].

III. MODELING AND SIMULATION
For the mechatronic design of a robot, it is important to
derive a dynamic model of the system. The model should
reßect the major physical effects, while being as simple as
possible. For a modular agricultural manipulator, we are cur-
rentlydevelopingintegrateddrivemodulesatdifferentscales.
Each module contains the following main components:
¥ Frameless brushless DC (BLDC) Motor
¥ HarmonicDrive Gear Transmission
¥ Motor Controller
¥ Incremental Encoder (on motor shaft)
¥ Absolute Encoder (on output shaft)
¥ Data and Power Interface on Input and Output side
To describe the dynamics of the module, a lumped compo-
nent model of relevant mechanic elements is given in Fig. 2,

The gear friction will be described by two different
models. The Þrst law Þts very well to the catalog data wherat
we will show in Sect. V that the second model can be very
acurately Þtted on our measurements.
One way of describing the friction term T

according to [10], is

This is a classic approach with a static friction term (T

the Coulomb friction (?|T

coupled load and speed dependent term (?|T
l

catalog of the gear manufacturer, experimental results on the

and temperature cases. During the design phase, this data can
be used to compute the parameter T

IV. TESTBED AND EXPERIMENTS
In this section, the design of the testbed and the automatic
test procedure is described. Furthermore, the investigated
robotic drive modules are introduced.
A. Test Procedure
In our experiments, we aimed to identify the characteristic
curve of the drive modules frictional behavior. Major inßu-
ences on the friction are the velocity and the load torque
1
.
Thus, in our experiments, measurements were conducted at
the unbounded system with varying angular velocities and
load torques. Considering a quasi-static state, and using the
torque balance, according to (1) Ð(3), it is possible to directly
calculate the friction torque, acting on the input side, based
on the measurement of the load torque and the effective
current

The inßuence of temperature is not investigated in this study. All
experiments were conducted after a warm-up phase. However, for an
indication of the temperature, a temperature sensor was attached to the
housing of the drive module.

(13)
This leads to a set of major system requirements on the
testbed, which are described in the following section.
B. Requirements and SpeciÞcations
In order to fully characterize the drive modules, in par-
ticular to identify friction effects, it is necessary to measure
the following quantities:
1) The torque T
a
on the input side.
2) The position ? and velocity ú ? on the input side.
3) The load torque T
l
on the output side.
4) The position q and velocity ú q on the output side.
Further requirements are:
5) It must be possible to change the load torque T
l
in a
close range from values close to zero up to the nominal
torque of the most powerful investigated module.
6) It must be possible to reach the maximum velocity of
the fastest module for any load case.
7) Experiments must be conducted without modifying the
modules.
8) Modular design allows for testing of different drive
modules.
The input torque cannot be measured directly, because
it is not possible to access the motor or wave generator
shaft without modifying the module. Thus, we rely on the
measurement of the effective current I, measured by the
motor controller and compute T
a
with (6) using the torque
constant provided by the motor manufacturer. The position
and velocity of the input shaft can be measured with the
incremental encoder of the modules.
C. Design of the Testbed
The maximum load torque for the design of the testbed
is deÞned as the highest nominal torque of the investigated
modules. To cover the complete range of possible load
torques, we decided to use two mechanical conÞgurations for
the testbed. The Þrst conÞguration covers lower load torques
and the second conÞguration handles higher torques. Thus,
we selected a torque sensor with two calibrated measuring
ranges (i.e. 0?20Nm and 20?200Nm) to ensure accurate
results. To apply the load torque, we decided to use a
current controlled hysteresis brake, due to the following
advantages: the load torque is continuously adjustable, the
brake torque is independent of the angular velocity, and due
to the working principle, the brake torque is applied contact-
free, thus the lowest possible load torque is only limited
by the damping in the bearings. By deÞnition, the brake
torque always acts against the motion of the drive making it
easy to control, in particular at reversing speeds. The brake
is from the company Mobac and has a minimum torque
of about 0.092Nm and a maximum torque of 17Nm. In
the Þrst conÞguration the brake is directly connected to the
torque sensor and in the second conÞguration, the brake is
connected via a gear transmission to the torque sensor. The

components so far can be lined up on a testbed shaft, which
is to be connected to the drive moduleÔs output shaft. To
allow the required modularity of testing different modules a
ßange is provided. Combined with a grooved panel, as basis
for the testbed, it is easy to design various adaptions, each
suitable for a speciÞc test module, respectively. Fig. 3 shows
a side view of the designed testbed and its components. In
the Þrst conÞguration, the gear 5 and the brake 6 are
decoupled with a clutch from the testbed. By the decoupling
of the gear transmission, the back driving torque of the gear
(i.e. the minimal required torque to move the gear from the
slow side with no load on the faster side of the gear) is
disconnected from the system. This allows the examination
of very low load torques across speeds in different directions.
To investigate higher load torques, the brake 4 can be
removed and connected with the gear transmission 5 to
the torque sensor. Furthermore, an incremental encoder is
added to the testbed 2 . The motor controller for the drives

D. Experiments
The test bench, as presented in section IV-C, allows for
testing over a broad range of angular velocities ú ? and loads
T
l
. For identiÞcation, a testing process to automatically
and repeatably examine the modules was developed. The
chosen approach was to set quasi-static points of operation,
i.e. combinations of speed ú ? and load T
l
. The points are
equally spaced between maximum and minimum speeds
and torques. An automatic mode, setting a constant speed
and subsequently increasing the controlled load torque to
a maximum value before moving to the next speed and
repeating the process, was implemented. Each point is held
for several seconds, to reach a quasi-static state. For the
analysis of the data, the active current I and the load torque
T
l
are Þltered by a low-pass Þlter after the experiment.
Subsequently, the input torque T
a
is calculated for each data
point (cf. (6)) and friction as well as efÞciency is determined
via (12) and (13). As a last step, the mean values for each
stationary point are calculated.
Two modules designed for the humanoid robot LOLA [12]
(hip adduction and ßexion, henceforth labeled A and B) and
one test joint of the agricultural manipulator prototype (C)
were experimentally investigated. Fig. 5 shows a picture of
two out of the three investigated modules. In Tab. II a brief
overview of the most important speciÞcations is given.

VI. CONCLUSIONS
This paper presented the design of a modular testbed for
experimental friction identiÞcation of robot drive modules.
The identiÞcation allows for an improvement of our models,
which is very important since we do not have joint torque
sensors installed. In addition, an automatic test procedure
to investigate and model steady-state friction effects has
been described and implemented. Experiments have been
conducted with three robotic drive modules with Harmon-
icDrive gear transmissions. All modules were developed at
ourinstitute.Although, themain source offrictionisthegear
transmission, the experiments showed that friction modeling
based on measurements is signiÞcantly improved compared
to modeling solely based on the catalog data of the gearÕs
manufacturer.
In a next step, the test procedure, will be further improved.
In particular, to obtain an accurate friction model for the
complete operating range of the modules, lower velocities
and load torques above the nominal motor torques will be
investigated.Tostudytheinßuenceoftemperaturevariations,
anothertestprocedureshouldbeconsidered.Furthermore,all
revolute joints of the CROPS manipulator prototype will be
measured on the testbed. On the one hand, this veriÞes the
design of the modules and on the other hand, we gain a very
accurate dynamic model of the robot which can be further
exploited by implementing a centralized control architecture.
