Cooperative Positioning/Orientation Control of Mobile
Heterogeneous Anisotropic Sensor Networks for Area Coverage
Yiannis Stergiopoulos and Anthony Tzes
Abstract—This article examines the coordination problem of
the nodes’ motion in a heterogeneous anisotropic mobile sensor
network for area coverage purposes. The mobile agents are
assumed to have non–uniform with varying scaling sensing ability
around themselves. The nodes’ sensor footprint is allowed to be
any arbitrary compact planar set, while the coordination scheme
accounts for rotation of the latter. The domain sensed by the
swarm is partitioned via the proposed distributed scheme that
differentiates for standard Voronoi–alike distance–based metrics.
The distributed cooperative scheme developed manages to lead
the group towards an area–optimal conﬁguration via proper
control of the movement and rotation of each sensing node.
Numerical results are provided in order to indicate the efﬁciency
of the proposed technique.

I. INTRODUCTION
Cooperative control of swarms has received increased inter-
est by the scientiﬁc community in the last decade. Although
each member of the group may act independently in order
to contribute to an objective cost, the beneﬁts acquired by
coordinated action as a team is largely increased [1, 2]. In these
cases the nodes act by taking into account information from
neighbouring members, while efﬁciently designed cooperative
strategies can lead the network in an optimal state, dependent
on the aggregate criterion [3, 4].
Robotic swarms have been utilized in coverage/surveillance
applications. Mobility offers the advantage of allowing to
the members of the team to evolve in space through time
autonomously and seek the optimum conﬁguration that would
serve the common purpose [5]. In either case, the mobile
platforms are equipped with RF antennas for agent–to–agent
communication, along with sensing devices such as micro-
phones, cameras, humidity/temperature sensors, smoke detec-
tors and others, dependent on the application. Thus, maximal
potential of the group’s abilities can be achieved via optimum
deployment schemes (area coverage) or optimal patrolling
trajectories (region surveillance) [6, 7].
The majority of the research in coordination of networks
examine the case where the nodes have uniform radial sens-
ing performance (i.e. circular sensing domains). There exist
several types of sensors that this model represents suitably
concerning their perceptional abilities (i.e. omnidirectional
microphones, smoke detectors). Extensions have also been
presented for accounting for unequal ranges of the disc sensor
model. The distributedness of the proposed control strategies

relies on spatially distributed evaluation of the corresponding
Euclidean/Laguerrean V oronoi cell [6, 8–10]. Speciﬁcally, each
node being able to evaluate its own region of responsibility
can decide the direction to move at that will lead towards the
network’s (local) area optimum conﬁguration.
The authors in [11] have proposed a distributed control
strategy for the wedge–shaped case, relying on standard Eu-
clidean V oronoi tessellation of the space. Extension to arbitrary
patterns has been introduced by the authors in [12], where
partitioning was performed in a pattern–based manner rather
than a distance–based one. However, in that case the sensors
were considered to have common orientation, while no rotation
of the sensing domain was taken into account. Apart from that
the sensory of the nodes, although arbitrary, was assumed to
be a compact convex set, derived as the maximal inscribed
convex set in the original footprint (in case of non–convex
domains). The reason for that demand was the utilization of
speciﬁc Helly–type theorems for planar convex curves [13,
14], during the development of the space partitioning.
This article is an extension of the authors’ work [12],
by allowing the rotation of the patterns, thus dropping the
conservative demand for common orientation. Furthermore,
the sensing footprint for the nodes is not required to be a
convex set (since the homothetic requirement [14] is dropped),
while heterogeneity in the network lies in the scaling factor of
the (common) pattern among the nodes. The proposed control
scheme is based on an appropriate partitioning of the sensed
space, while in the sequel account for both translational and
rotational motion of the nodes in order to reach an area–
optimum topological state.
The rest of the article is organized as follows. In section
II the main assumptions concerning the network’s sensing
performance are introduced, while the group’s optimization
objective is formally stated. The proposed algorithm for parti-
tioning the sensed space via the core footprint is presented in
section III. In section IV the distributed coordination scheme
based on the aforementioned region–assignment is developed,
emphasizing in the additional rotational degree of freedom.
Simulation results are presented in section V in order to
indicate the efﬁciency of the proposed scheme, followed
by comparative discussions on its advantages over existing
circular–approximation–based approaches (in coverage–based
terms), while concluding remarks along with future extensions
are discussed in the last section.

Let each node be equipped with a sensing device appropriate
for the current swarm–objective. In contrast to the majority of
the works in coverage control, the sensing patterns considered
in this work are not required to be node–centred circular ones
(standard disc model). In regard to the extensions provided in
comparison with the authors’ work [12], in this article:
 The approach of under–approximating the original pattern
(non–convex in the general case) with the maximal–
area inscribed node–centred disc (Fig. 1a) or convex set
(Fig. 1b) is extended by taking into account the original
footprints in the coordination scheme (convex or not).
 The demand for common orientation among the nodes’
convex approximated footprints (Fig. 1b) is dropped,
allowing for different ones, not only during the initial
conﬁguration, but throughout the network evolution, by
adding extra control inputs for orientation control.
 Although all nodes are assumed to be equipped with
the same kind of sensor (i.e. same sensing pattern), the
latter is allowed to be scaled among the nodes (Fig. 1c),
incorporating the network’s heterogeneity.

The decision for the motion is taken based on own self–
localization information along with that acquired from the
neighbouring nodes. In regard to the need for information
exchange, it is assumed that:
Assumption 1. Each node has sufﬁcient transceiver RF–range
so that it can exchange information at any time with any node
that it shares sensed parts with.
III. PROPOSED PATTERN–BASED PARTITIONING
Having in mind the need for distributed coordination scheme
towards the optimization of the overall coverage performance
of the network, a region of responsibility is assigned at each
node in a local manner, assisting in lowering the computational
complexity in the optimization problem via proper space
decomposition.
A. Related Approaches
The most common approach followed in swarm coordina-
tion for deﬁning the way that the conﬁguration space is tessel-
lated among the nodes is the well–known V oronoi partitioning
[15]. More speciﬁcally, each node is set responsible for the
parts of the area under consideration that are closer to that node
compared to any other in the network. The resulting V oronoi
diagram is proven to be the optimal way of tessellating the
space in the Euclidean metric in a distance–based manner,
based only on the nodes’ coordinates, while suitably resolves
the standard case of swarms with disc–patterns. Alternatively,
considering heterogeneity among the members of the network
via unequal disc–radii, the power diagram can be utilized for
the space partitioning purpose, which can be considered as the
V oronoi diagram in the Laguerrean metric [10, 16].
The main issue with the previous approach lies mainly
in the disc–model approximation rather than the partitioning
method itself. Although almost any sensing pattern can be
approximated with its maximal inscribed node–centred disc,
1107
resulting in rotation–invariant schemes, the approximation cost
is in some cases extremely conservative, comparing the real
and approximated coverage performances of the network.
An extension to this issue has been recently proposed by
the authors [12], bypassing the standard uniform model. More
speciﬁcally, a partitioning scheme (followed by the proper
coordination algorithm) has been proposed, that takes into
account the maximal inscribed convex set, rather than the
circular one. However, the demand for common orientation
of the sensors’ footprints, arising from utilization of particular
Helly–type theorems [14], imposes a hard constraint from an
application point of view.
This article, considers the case where the nodes have non–
uniform, not necessarily convex, unequally scaled sensing
footprints, allowing for different pattern–orientations as well.
The partitioning is performed in the network’s sensed space,
rather than the whole region of interest.
B. Proposed Partitioning
Let C
i
; i2 I
n
be the sensing patterns of the n nodes of a
network, which are assumed: a) non-uniform and non–convex
(in the general case), b) same in shape, though unequally
scaled, c) non–commonly oriented (in the general case). These
features have been graphically summarized in Fig. 1c. Each
footprint is characterized by a pinch–point, which is the node
itself; its positioning is denoted as x
i
, while q
i
stands for the
orientation of the pattern/sensing–node.
Unlike distance–based tessellation schemes that are based
on the nodes’ positioning alone and uniform disc sensing
models, the approach presented in this article relies solely on
the footprints. Let W
i
be the region of responsibility of node
i, restricted in the domain of interest D. The former is deﬁned
via comparison of that node’s footprint with the pattern of any
other neighbouring node, as the part of the sensed space that
is sensed by that node only, that is

complete tessellation of the sensed space, since the common
parts of the sensing domains are not yet characterized. Let us

Remark 2. Unlike the cells resulting from distance–based

[12], the sets deﬁned in (5) are, in the generic case, non–
compact.

sensed space is partitioned and assigned among the nodes via
the proposed scheme. The non–coloured parts of the sensed

c
and correspond to the parts of
the network that are sensed by more than one node at the
same time. It should be noted that the sensed domain of the
bottom small node (node 1) belongs to that set since it lies
exclusively in the sensing region of a “larger” node (in terms
of pattern–scale; purple–coloured) (Remark 3). As deﬁned in
(5), one can verify that the assigned parts are the ones that
are sensed exclusively by one node, while the issue stated in
Remark 2 can be examined via the nodes 4–5, indicating the
(possibly) disjoint nature of the resulting cells.

IV. DISTRIBUTED MOTION COORDINATION
Assuming self–organizing robotic swarms, each mobile
agent should be able to plan its motion so that it contributes to
the aggregate swarm objective, while based on local informa-
tion rather than requiring knowledge of the global network’s
state. To this end, the proposed partitioning deﬁnition pre-
sented in the previous section is utilized in order to efﬁciently
resolve the control design problem concerning the nodes’
motion.
Unlike the majority of works presented in the existing
literature on the ﬁeld of distributed swarm coordination, this
work incorporates rotation of the sensing pattern, thus allowing
an extra degree of freedom, and demanding an extended
control design. The need for rotation arises from the fact
of a non–radial anisotropic sensing performance assumption,
providing however the ability to achieve far better optimal
topological conﬁgurations.

Let us further introduce some notations at this point. For
any set S with well–deﬁned exterior, let n(x) stand for the
outward unit normal vector pointing towards the exterior of S
for any x2¶S, where ¶S is the boundary of the set. For the
sake of notations’ simplicity, the former deﬁnition is extended
in the case where the set S is non–compact, too, as long as
the exterior of every sub–part of it is well–deﬁned. These
properties hold for both W
i
and W
c

presented also visually in Fig. 2. We will refer to n(x); x2¶W

and n(x); x2¶W

simply as n

point let us state the main result.

model, the rotational part of the control action is not taken

V. SIMULATION STUDIES
Numerical results derived from simulations studies con-
ducted are presented in this section. The domain under surveil-
lance D is identical to the one used in [17] for consistency
purposes. The proposed control law (8)–(9) based on the
partitioning scheme (5) presented in section III is compared
for evaluation purposes with the control proposed in [17],
appropriate for disc–modelled networks.
Speciﬁcally, the proposed control action was

corresponds to its range–limited V oronoi
cell [15], while has been proven that it leads to area–optimal
conﬁgurations for uniform homogeneous networks. Extensions
for the heterogeneous case can also be found in [18, 20, 21].
For numerical evaluations, a network of 8 nodes is exam-
ined. Their sensing footprints are assumed ellipsoidal ones
with their axes–parameters set as a= 0:5 units; b= 0:3 units,
while the relative position of the node to the footprint is set at
half–way along the long axis. All nodes are initially randomly
placed in a small region of the interior of D, with random
patterns’ orientations.
Initially, the control scheme (13) is applied in order to con-
trol the nodes’ motion. The ellipsoidal model is approximated
as the maximal inscribed node–centred disc, while standard
V oronoi partitioning is utilized during the coordination stage
in order to perform region–assignment and evaluate the control
action. The nodes’ initial conﬁguration, their paths followed
during transition, along with the ﬁnal network’s conﬁguration
are presented from left to right in the top row of Fig. 4, in
this order.
Judging from the end–conﬁguration one can observe at ﬁrst
that the nodes have indeed positioned themselves in an area–
optimal topology, considering the disc models, as expected.
Apparently, due to the rotation–invariance of the disc model,
there is no control to amend for orientation–regulation of
the original footprints. Examining, though, the real network’s
performance evaluated via the original ellipsoidal patterns, it
is evident that the network can achieve far better sensing cov-
erage ratio of the space under consideration. More speciﬁcally,
the network starting from an initial coverage percentage of D
equal to 35.26% converges to 52.05%, as shown with the blue
line in Fig. 5, which is the optimal network’s performance
if someone takes into account only the approximated discs.
It should be stated clearly that this deﬁciency is due to the
Fig. 5. Evolution of covered area percentage w.r.t. time evaluated via the
non–uniform original patterns. Blue (Red) line corresponds to top (bottom)
row of Fig. 4.
disc–approximation of the nodes’ performance rather than the
control law itself, while comparative studies are performed
mainly for evaluation purposes.
On the other hand, utilizing the proposed control scheme
for the nodes’ motion coordination, that takes into account
both the patterns’ anisotropy and the need for their orientation
regulation, produces the results depicted in the bottom row of
Fig. 4. It is apparent that the nodes have been organized in a
way that optimum coverage is attained, equal to 74.16% (red
line in Fig. 5), while their orientation is controlled properly
via (9), throughout the whole evolution.
It should be noted that the proposed scheme has increased
complexity in its evaluation when dealing with arbitrary non–
convex sensing domains, especially when compared with
approaches that are based on disc models. Particularly, the
demand arises from the difﬁculty in parametrizing complex
boundary curves, when compared to evaluations that are based
on circle–arcs. In fact, even if numerical approaches are
utilized in order to avoid complex curves’ descriptions, extra
computational demand is needed at evaluating the correspond-
ing boundary–parts appearing in the proposed control law.
However, the overall network’s performance in our case is by
far superior to that of disc–approximating techniques, arising
so a trade–off to balance: complexity vs. performance.
VI. CONCLUSIONS
Coordination of a group of mobile agents with heteroge-
neous arbitrary sensory for optimum area deployment is ex-
amined in this article. The network is consisted of nodes whose
sensing regions differ in regard to scaling and orientation,
highly differentiating from standard circular–case assumptions
appearing in the existing literature. Efﬁcient partitioning of
the sensed domain is proposed in order for the nodes to
distributively evaluate the corresponding parts that should
determine their motion for coverage–increase. The presented
scheme guarantees monotonic increase of the area sensed by
the network while accounts not only for the nodes’ positioning,
