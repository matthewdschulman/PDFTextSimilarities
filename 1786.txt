Abstract—This paper presents an overview of our research
on accounting for robot pose uncertainty in area coverage
applications. In the vast majority of existing literature on
robotics area coverage, the location uncertainty of the robot is
not considered. An uncertain robot pose results in an uncertain
sensor swath, which in turn creates uncertainty about the
achieved coverage. Here, we present a general framework
where pose estimates are mapped through the coverage sensor
model to obtain a probability of coverage over the discretized
workspace. This probabilistic representation can then be used
to adaptively plan paths for coverage based on an entropy
reduction formulation.
This framework is particularly well-suited to autonomous
underwater vehicles (AUVs) performing seabed surveying oper-
ations.TheAUVpositionestimatedivergesfromtheactualAUV
position while submerged due to the lack of a global position
reference. This discrepancy can result in parts of the seabed
being missed, which is unacceptable in safety-critical missions
suchasminecountermeasures.Theproposedinformation-based
path planning approach is able to guarantee area coverage
even in the case of severe AUV position estimate drift. In-water
experiments with an AUV show the effectiveness of the method.
I. INTRODUCTION
Coverage of an area is a common task for a robotic
platform and has many applications. Different methods for
generating provably complete coverage paths exist in the
literature [1], [2]. However, as is noted in [3] “The term
complete is used in the motion planning sense, not in the
operating research ﬁeld sense.” While a deterministic planner
might produce complete coverage plans there is no guarantee
of actual area coverage in the ﬁeld.
Seabed surveying by an autonomous underwater vehicle
(AUV) can be considered as an area coverage problem [4].
With the reduction in size and cost of AUVs, this mission is
now being completely automated. Localization of an AUV
when submerged without the use of pre-localized beacon
hardware is a challenging task [5]. In this work we extend
the capabilities of these low-cost vehicles with relatively
poor navigation to safety-critical missions such as seabed
surveying for mine countermeasures (MCM)
As motivation, consider Fig. 1 which shows a real AUV
attempting to cover (scan) an area of seabed with a sidescan

sonar (SSS). The mission was run on the surface for access
to GPS for ground truth but the GPS measurements are
not fused to generate the state estimate when the AUV
is within the workspace (yellow box). This simulates the
AUV submerging to perform the survey and then surfacing
at the end of each leg for a GPS ﬁx. AUV position was
estimated on-board using an extended Kalman ﬁlter (EKF)
which fused velocity over ground measurements from the
Doppler velocity log (DVL) and heading from the compass.
Fig. 1-a shows the workspace (region to scan) in yellow,
the pre-planned lawn mower style tracks to scan the area
with the SSS in green, the AUV position estimates from the
EKF in red, and the actual trajectory from the GPS data
in blue. Fig. 1-b shows the desired coverage that would be
achieved if the AUV were able to exactly follow its pre-
planned lawn mower tracks, Fig. 1-c shows the believed
coverage based on the EKF position estimates, and Fig. 1-
d shows the coverage based on the GPS data. In this case
the desired coverage was 96% (b), the estimated coverage
was 80% (c), and the achieved coverage was 67% (d).
When sonar seabed coverage is for a safety critical task
such as mine counter-measures (MCM), this represents an
unacceptably large discrepancy between the acceptable risk
(b), the perceived risk (c), and the actual risk (d) associated
with assets and personnel transiting over this seabed area.
The actual AUV path can deviate from the planned path
because: 1) the vehicle has insufﬁcient command authority
to follow the path, 2) external disturbances such as currents

or sea states cause deviations, or 3) the AUV location
estimate contains uncertainties and errors as a result of noisy
sensor data. Path tracking errors have been considered in the
general start-to-goal path planning literature (e.g. [6], [7],
[8]), however, to a lesser extent in a coverage context. In
[9], a heuristic method combines three types of behaviors:
inward spiral, shifting spiral, and greedy. The application is
a car-like robot that mows grass and the robot’s kinematic
constraints are explicitly considered. The coverage map is
maintained and after the initial pass with inward spiral and
shifting spiral behaviors, the missing areas are covered using
a greedy approach. Localization uncertainty is accounted
for by explicitly planning paths to have overlap across
neighbouring sensor swaths.
In [10] a “probably approximately correct” measure of
coverage performance is developed to account for sensor
uncertainty. The authors correctly argue that once vehicle
localization error is signiﬁcant, the deﬁnition of complete
coverage must be adapted to become probabilistic. For ex-
ample, “80% certainty that at least 90% of the workspace has
been covered” could be a valid mission objective, whereas
“cover at least 85% of the workspace” is not. However, the
approach in [10] only considers uniform sensor characteris-
tics and provides no adaptive approach to account for the
robot’s pose uncertainty. Also, in [10] it is assumed that the
localization error variance attains a steady-state. This is not
a valid assumption for a dead-reckoning vehicle.
In general, the methods in the literature propose adjusting
existing heuristics so that the vehicle uncertainty may be
accounted for (e.g. move tracks or spirals closer together).
However this can produce paths with unnecessary sensor
overlap in the case that path tracking error is low. Here,
we maintain the probability of coverage over the discretized
workspace by projecting the location estimate through the
coverage sensor characteristic. This approach has the distinct
advantage that we can now use the probability of coverage
over the workspace to plan paths for coverage that adaptively
account for the sensor location uncertainty. We propose that
an entropy reduction approach is appropriate for planning
these paths.
The probabilistic coverage framework is generally appli-
cable but particularly suited to the AUV seabed surveying
mission.
To summarize, the contributions of the presented work are
as follows:
1) A probabilistic coverage model that fuses state estima-
tion with a sensor coverage model to obtain a stochas-
tic representation of the coverage over the workspace.
2) A coverage path planning algorithm based on the
probabilistic coverage representation that adaptively
accounts for robot location uncertainty. Coverage is
posed as an entropy reduction problem and paths are
planned to meet this objective.
3) An application with in-water results of an AUV de-
ployed for underwater seabed surveying for MCM.
The probabilistic coverage framework is developed in
general terms in Sec. II. This framework is then applied

II. THE PROBABILISTIC COVERAGE FRAMEWORK
We ﬁrst formulate the area coverage problem with known
poses. We then extend the formulation to consider uncertain
poses and describe how to recursively update the probabilis-
tic coverage map. Finally, we formally deﬁne new criteria
for mission completion in the probabilistic case.
A. Area Coverage Problem Formulation
Consider a robot with platform geometryA and coverage
sensor swathS (Fig. 2). Deﬁne the workspace,W, as the
area that is to be covered by the sensor.
The workspace is decomposed into N small grid cells
where the size of the cells is sufﬁciently small that the
coverage can be treated as uniform over the cell. Each cell
is represented by its position in the workspace. For example,
for the two-dimensional case,c
i
, [x
i
;y
i
]
T
such thatx
i
and
y
i
are the x and y locations, respectively, of cell c
i
in the
global frame
1
.
If the robot takes a sensor measurement at timet, then the
set of all cells that are somewhat covered by the measurement
deﬁnes the coverage sensor swath,S
t
.
The position of a celli in the sensor frame is obtained by
performing a transformation from the global to the sensor
frame through the robot body frame:

the level to which cell c

is covered at time t.

Based on a detailed investigation of the coverage sensor,
such as ESPRESSO [11] for the case of AUV seabed
surveying (See Sec. III), the cell coverage values are updated
according to:
w

=H(
s

where H(

) represents the coverage sensor model and
deﬁnes how to update the coverage value of the cells based
on their locations in the sensor frame.
If we assume a uniform coverage sensor, cells are either
completely covered or not at all, and w2f0:5; 1g

. This
means that each cell is either covered (w = 1) or not (w =
0:5). In this case we state the complete coverage objective
as requiring
w
i
t
= 1;8i = 1::N: (3)
However, with some sensors, such as the SSS, the coverage
sensor performance is not uniform and w 2 [0:5; 1]. As
a result, (3) can become difﬁcult or impossible to achieve
depending on the model. The mission is generally considered
complete either when a proportion of cells, P

covered to a speciﬁed level w

B. Coverage with Uncertain Poses
We now remove the assumption common to most cover-
age algorithms that the coverage sensor is deterministically
localized. As a result, (4) and (5) are not sufﬁcient criteria
for mission completion because they do not encapsulate the
uncertainty in the coverage induced by the uncertainty in
robot pose.
The ﬁltered posterior pose distribution at time t given all
previous odometry and measurements is given by bel(x

[12]:

),p(x

The state at time t is recursively estimated through an ap-
proximation of the Bayes’ ﬁlter which operates in a predict-
update cycle. Prediction is done through [12]:

and update is given by:

): (8)
The probabilistic process model p(x
t
jx
t 1
;u
t
) incorporates
the noise associated with transitioning from x
t 1
to x
t
2
For convenience and to unify coverage problems deﬁned by actuation
and detection we deﬁne not covered as w = 0:5 and covered as w = 1. If
the coverage sensor model is deﬁned over [0,1] we can easily map it to the
range [0.5,1]
and the measurement model p(z
t
jx
t
) incorporates noise
associated with sensor updates.
The pose belief at timet is used to generate a probability
of coverage for all grid cells in the workspace. Now, instead
of each cell having one value that represents its coverage, it
has a distribution representing the probability of coverage
to different levels. The position of cell i in the sensor
frame is now uncertain and is represented by a random
variable
s
C
i
t
whose distribution is calculated by mapping the
position of the cell in the global frame through the uncertain
transformation from global to sensor frame:
p(

s
g
T
t

c
i
t
) (9)
is the probability that celli sits at location
s
c
i
t
in the sensor
frame at time t.
The uncertain location of the cell in the sensor frame
results in an uncertain coverage. Consequently, the coverage
is represented by a random variable W
i
t
where p(W
i
t
=w)
represents the probability that celli is covered to a coverage
level w at time t considering all past AUV states.
It is useful to deﬁne a random variable

W
i
t
that represents
the probability that cell i is covered to a level w resulting
from only the sensor measurements at time t.
C. Propagating Robot Pose Uncertainty to Coverage Distri-
bution
In this section we describe the process for estimating
the coverage distribution due to a single coverage sensor
measurement from an uncertain location. The distribution
p(


cell location in the sensor frame through the coverage sensor
model,H:

D. Recursive Coverage Estimation
Equation (11) provides a means to propagate the AUV
pose uncertainty through the sensor characteristic to obtain
an estimate of the coverage distribution from a single sensor
pose. Over the course of a coverage mission, the AUV will
move around the workspace and may cover cells multiple
times. A means is needed to combine the coverage distribu-
tion from time t with all previous coverage instances at the
same location from times 0 to t  1.
It is motivated in [4] and [12] that the most pessimistic
way to fuse measurements of the same location, but at differ-
ent times, is to assume that they are statistically dependent,
in which case the maximum function is applied (the coverage
can be no less than the greatest value it was covered to in
all of the previous passes). Furthermore, it is argued that
subsequent SSS measurements of one location for an MCM
mission are statistically dependent in [14].
Using the statistical dependance assumption, we can recur-
sively deﬁne the coverage distribution using the maximum
function on random variables:
W
i
t
= max(

W
i
t
;W
i
t 1
) (13)
where the distribution of W
i
t
can be determined using [13]:
p(W

+p(W
i
t 1
=w)
Z
w
0
p(

W
i
t
=)d
(14)
As a result, the coverage distribution at time t for cell i
is based only on the pose at time t (used to generate

W
i
t
)
and the coverage distribution at time t  1, W
i
t 1
. As a
result, the Markov assumption can be applied to the coverage
sensor measurements and sensor data can be discarded once
the coverage distribution at time t has been updated. An
overview of the iterative coverage estimation process is
summarized in Algorithm 1.
E. Full Trajectory Estimation for Coverage
This framework as proposed thus far is independent of
the type of state estimation algorithm used. Coverage over
the workspace is dependent on the entire sensor trajectory,
therefore to obtain the best estimate of the coverage belief,
we require the best estimate of the entire vehicle trajectory as
opposed to just the present state. We update (6) to estimate
the posterior of the entire vehicle trajectory:
bel(x
1:t
),p(x
t
ju
1:t
;z
1:t
;x
0
): (15)
This approach is particularly applicable to the case when a
vehicle is receiving intermittent global position updates such
as an AUV surfacing for GPS ﬁxes. Each time the vehicle
receives a global update, the trajectory is re-optimized and
the coverage map is recalculated based on the updated state
beliefs. In practice, a sliding window approach can be used
to maintain constant time scalability.
F . New Deﬁnition of Mission Completion
As argued previously, the deterministic mission comple-
tion criteria (4) and (5) must now be updated to reﬂect the
fact that the coverage is probabilistic.
The ﬁrst completion criterion (4) requires that a proportion
P
1
of the area be covered up to at least level w
thresh
. This
is updated to require that the proportion,P
1
, of the area has
a probability of being covered to at least a level w
thresh
of
at least P

The second mission criterion criterion (5) is to have
achieved a desired average coverage, w

workspace. This is updated to require an expected average
coverage greater than w

In the case where the coverage sensor characteristic is

proximately complete” measure of completeness presented
in [10].
III. APPLYING THE PROBABILISTIC COVERAGE
FRAMEWORK TO AUV SEABED SURVEYING
Some underwater seabed survey missions use sidescan
sonar as the payload sensor. The SSS processes high fre-
quency sonar echoes to generate an image of the seabed. An
object on the seabed will cast a sonar shadow that can be
analyzed to determine if it is potentially a mine. The on-
board SSS gathers data as the AUV transits along rectilinear
paths as shown in Fig. 3.
In 2006, the NATO Undersea Research Centre (now Centre
for Marine Research and Experimentation) created a model
to quantify minehunting sonar performance that incorporates
physical parameters that inﬂuence the probability of detect-
ing a target in sonar data called the Extensible Performance
and Evaluation Suite for Sonar (ESPRESSO) [11], [15].

the plot shows only one side.
The output of the model is a lateral range curve, P (y),
that deﬁnes the probability that a target at lateral distance
y from the AUV’s track will be detected along that track
and subsequently correctly classiﬁed as being suggestive of
a mine (referred to as conﬁdence). Parameters that affect
the lateral range curve fall into four general categories:
environmental, target, sonar, and platform (AUV).
Fig. 4 shows the lateral range curves generated by
ESPRESSO for three different seabed types: cobble, sand,
and clay, all at a water depth of 10 m.
Localization error is not negligible in AUV surveys since
the AUV has no access to a global position reference when
it is submerged. It is in this mode that the iterative coverage
estimation process described by Algorithm 1 is performed.
Since the SSS can only generate useful mosaicked data
when the AUV is in rectilinear motion, we simplify the
problem by only considering the cross-track uncertainty in
the AUV location. As a result, the pose distribution is
projected onto the line orthogonal to the direction of AUV
travel as shown in Fig. 5.
It is assumed that DVL, GPS, and compass noise are
normally distributed (for a deeper investigation on the noise
characteristics of these sensors and the Gaussian assumption
see [16]) so that the AUV position is estimated as a bivariate
Gaussian distribution of the random variables (X

characteristic. The distribution of the orthogonal distance of
the cell from the sensor is shown in red (bottom right). The
sonar coverage sensor model (ESPRESSO) is shown in blue
(top right). The cell location distribution is mapped through
the coverage sensor model to obtain the coverage distribution
resulting from this one single measurement (top left).

A lower bound on the coverage can be obtained recursively
by applying the maximum function on random variables
deﬁned in (14) to determine the coverage distribution W
i
t
.
Each time the vehicle surfaces for GPS, the trajectory is re-
optimized and the coverage distributions are recalculated in
a batch process. In practice there is no need to re-optimize
the entire vehicle trajectory, only the parts that are still being
appreciably changed by new GPS updates.
IV. COVERAGE PATH PLANNING WITHIN THE
PROBABILISTIC FRAMEWORK
Past approaches to AUV seabed surveying have planned
structured (lawn mower or zig-zag) paths off-line and as-
sumed that the tracks are followed exactly. We propose
an information-based approach which extends our previous
work [4] by accounting for uncertainty in the AUV pose.
A. The Conﬁdence Map
Deﬁne a binary random variable

T
i
t
2f0; 1g that repre-
sents whether cell c
i
will be correctly classiﬁed as either
containing a mine, or not, at time t:
p(

T
i
t
= 1) =p(detection) +p(correct no detection)
p(

T
i
t
= 0) =p(false alarm) +p(missed target)
(22)
For each

T
i
t
, p(

T
i
t
= 1)2 [0:5; 1] represents the conﬁdence,
or probability of correct classiﬁcation, of cell c
i
as either
containing a target or not, and p(

T
i
t
= 0) = 1 p(T
i
t
= 1)
is the probability of incorrect classiﬁcation.
Additionally, for each cell, i, associate a binary random
variable, T
i
t
, where p(T
i
t
= 1) represents the conﬁdence by
combining all the “looks” of celli from the start of the survey
until timet. This collection of random variables,T
1:N
t
is the
conﬁdence map.
At the start of the mission the conﬁdence values are all
initialized to 0.5: p(T
i
t0
= 1) = 0:5; 8i = 1::N.
B. Updating the Conﬁdence Map
As the AUV navigates around the workspace the conﬁ-
dence map is updated based on the current AUV pose and
the parameters that affect sonar performance: environment,
target, sonar, and platform.
The target detection event can be represented by the
Bayes’ network shown in Fig. 7. Any variable with the
superscript i varies across the workspace and any variable
with the subscript t varies with time.
Deﬁne E
i
t
= fE
i
;S;F;V
t
g as the set of all random
variables that affect the generation of the lateral range
characteristic at cell i and time t. We can express the joint
probability of conﬁdence based on a single observation and
combination of sensor, environment, and AUV pose as:
p(

T
i
t
= 1jE
i
t
= "
i
t
;X
t
=x
t
)p(E
i
t
= "
i
t
)p(X
t
=x
t
) (23)
Denote the sonar lateral range characteristic generated by
the ESPRESSO model with parameters "
i
t
as P
"
i
t
(y) where
Fig. 7. Bayes’ network representing target detection similar to [17]. Arrows
represent conditional probabilities.
y is the lateral range. p(

T

i
t

i
t
;X
t

t
) is read
directly from the lateral range curve:
p(

T
i
t
= 1jE
i
t
= "
i
t
;X
t
=x
t
) =
(
P
"
i
t
(
s
y
i
t
) if c
i
2S
t
0:5 otherwise
(24)
where
s
y
i
t
is the orthogonal distance from the AUV track
to the cell i at time t. For simplicity of formulation, we
assume here that the environmental parametersE
i
t
are known
(p(E
i
t
= "
i
t
) = 1) however the extension to the case where
both the environmental parameters and pose are uncertain is
straightforward. For a more detailed investigation of the case
of uncertain parameters see [4].
We can evaluate the conﬁdence resulting from a single
sonar sensor measurement at time t for cell i by marginal-
izing over all poses:
p(

T
i
t
= 1) =
X
xt
p(

T
i
t
= 1;E
i
t
= "
i
t
;X
t
=x
t
)
=E
Xt
[p(

T
i
t
= 1jE
i
t

i

;X

t
)]
=
(
Es
Y
i
t
[P
"
i
t
(
s
Y
i
t
)] if cell c
i
2S
t
0:5 otherwise
(25)
The sonar lateral range curve is a speciﬁc example of the
general coverage sensor functionH deﬁned in (2). So (25)
can be rewritten using the general framework of Sec. II as:
Es
Y
i
t
[P

i
t
)] =Es
C
i
t
[H(
s
C
i
t
)] =E[

W
i
t
]: (26)
Consequently, the conﬁdence from one look p(

T
i
t
= 1) in
the case of the AUV seabed coverage problem is evaluated as
the mean of the coverage distribution from the probabilistic
framework. For the cells that are in the sensor swath:
p(

T
i
t
= 1) =E[

W
i
t
] (27)
The ﬁnal conﬁdence after combining n looks can be
expressed as:
p(T

where the necessity to maintain the entire coverage distri-
butions as opposed to just the distribution means is due
to the fact that the expectation operator, E, cannot be dis-
tributed across the maximum operator:E[maxf

C. Information-Based Coverage Path Planning
It is proposed here that Shannon entropy reduction of
the conﬁdence map variables is an appropriate and novel
way of adaptively achieving coverage. The expected entropy
reduction (EER) is given by:
H(T
i
t
jE
i
t
;X
t
),H(T
i
t
) E
Xt
[H(T
i
t
jE
i
t
;X
t
)]; (29)
where H(T ) = E[logp(T )] is the Shannon entropy. The
EER deﬁnes a scalar quantity that represents the a priori
expected amount of information that will be gained about
T
i
t
by making the sonar measurement from the uncertain
pose X
t
at time t with environmental parameters E
i
t
.
The EERs specify a way of combining the potential
beneﬁts of sensor observations additively. We can compute
the total EER at timet as the sum of the EERs of every cell
in the sensor swath:
H(T
t
jE
1:N
t
;X
t
) =
X
i:c

2St
H(T

i
t
;X
t
) (30)
where T
t
, [T
1
t
;T
2
t
;:::;T
N
t
].
In order to plan a path, we perform a search over a set
of potential next poses and evaluate their beneﬁt. In this
ﬂexible framework we can specify any meaningful domain
of next poses to be searched over in order to ﬁnd a locally
optimal path. Here we propose one possible domain that is
particularly well-suited to the seabed surveying application.
We optimize the location of each subsequent track after each
previous track is completed. The placement of the next track
to be followed should maximize the information to be gained
subject to the constraint that no gaps are left to guarantee
actual coverage in the ﬁeld.
From Fig. 8, the optimization takes place over the domain
of d subject to the constraint that the area A satisfy mission
completion. Deﬁne the next track as 
d
parameterized by s:

d
: [0; 1]!Q
free
;s!
d
(s)

d
(0) = (d;x
min
); 
d
(1) = (d;x
max
)
(31)
where x
min
and x
max
are the minimum and maximum x
values of the track, andQ
free
is the free conﬁguration space,
or set of all possible poses in the environment that will not
collide with obstacles [18].
In this case we select (17), which is the probabilistic
version of (5), as the criterion for mission completion since
average conﬁdence is an accurate representation of the risk
associated with moving an asset and personnel over the area.
The average conﬁdence objective is used and motivated in
other work on AUV MCM, such as [14].
The optimization to select the value d that maximizes the
information gained is:

V. IN-WATER RESULTS
In-water tests were performed to test the proposed meth-
ods. Example results are shown in Fig. 9 and Fig. 10. This
was performed in the same workspace as Fig. 1, which is
a square box approximately 200m by 300m. The AUV runs
on the surface but the GPS data is not fused into the state
estimate unless the AUV is at the beginning or end of a track
(where a GPS ﬁx might normally occur). Each time a track is
completed, the optimization (32) is re-run until convergence.
In some cases acquiring the GPS ﬁx and computing the
optimal track takes time, so the AUV executes a loiter pattern
while this is ongoing. The mission completion criterion is:
1

i=1
E[W

A
N
X
i:c
i
2A
p(T
i

) = 1> 0:985 (34)
or a mean average probability of 98.5% coverage.
The ﬁnal trajectory and achieved coverage map from the
GPS data are shown in Fig. 10, where the blue dot indicates
the moment at which the coverage objective was met. The
essential new capability here is that even though the AUV has
very poor path tracking capability, it is still able to achieve
its coverage objective.
VI. CONCLUDING REMARKS
This paper presents a probabilistic framework within
which paths can be generated that guarantee coverage based
on new probabilistic coverage criteria. The pose belief is
used to generate a coverage estimate that is maintained as
the robot navigates around its workspace. This is applied
to the example of autonomous underwater vehicle seabed
coverage for mine counter-measures. A path planning frame-
work within the probabilistic coverage space is proposed
based on information theory. It is shown that with this
adaptive approach it can be guaranteed that mission coverage
objectives are met.

Fig. 9. The 8 plots show the state of the system after GPS updates are
obtained nearing the end of each track. Time progresses from left to right
and top to bottom. Units are in meters. The sensor characteristic used is the
10m depth cobble seabed type of Fig. 5. In each plot: yellow: workspace
to be covered; green: track that has just been followed, and red: achieved
trajectory that has been followed to that point based on the GPS data. Each
time a track is ﬁnished the location of the next track is optimized based on
(34) so that the workspace is guaranteed to be covered. The AUV is able
to cover the area to 98.9% even though it is drifting more than 20m over a
200m track.

Fig. 10. The ﬁnal estimated trajectory overlaid on the coverage map
(darker area indicates higher coverage). Final mean conﬁdence is 98.9%
and required 9 tracks to complete.
This is the ﬁrst known method that explicitly accounts
for robot uncertainty for area coverage and a path plan-
ning approach is presented that exploits this probabilistic
representation to achieve coverage even in the case that
localization is poor.
In the case of a safety critical application such as AUV
MCM, it is motivated that having the most accurate estimate
possible of the state of the coverage over the workspace is
important, since overconﬁdence or missed areas are espe-
cially undesirable.
