Abstract—This paper proposes a novel set-point control
method of a musculoskeletal system by combining a feedfor-
wardandfeedbackmannertocomplementeach drawbackeach
other. In our previous work, a feedforward positioning method
of the musculoskeletal arm model was proposed which does
not need any realtime sensory information. Its performance,
however, depends on a muscular arrangement and an attitude
of the arm, and thereby a large initial muscular internal force
is necessary to make a good performance. On the other hand,
it is well-known that a visual servoing is effective and versatile
for the set-point control. However, there is a considerable
time-delay due to a computational burden to acquire useful
information from an image and an insufﬁcient sampling period
to capture each image when using a video frame rate camera.
Thus in this paper, the feedforward and feedback signal are
linearly combined into one in order to mutually complement
each drawback. The combined control signal is newly designed

I. INTRODUCTION
There is no doubt that human movements are still much
smoother and more sophisticated than those of present
robotic systems. It is said that these sophisticated movements
are conducted by the appropriate combination of two main
control strategies, the feedforward control using propriocep-
tive information and the feedback control using a lot of
sensory information such as visual or tactile information. It
is known that the sensory feedback control loop of a human
body contains a considerable time-delay. In particular, the
visual feedback loop using eyes has more than 100 ms delay
fromjust asensingmomenttoits responsemovement.There-
fore, it is hard to accomplish a fast movement conducted
within shorter than dozens of milli seconds by only using
the sensory feedback control manner. Meanwhile, making
only use of the feedforward control manner must be difﬁcult
to perform an accurate and robust positioning in unknown
environments. Namely, both the feedforward and feedback
control manners play each crucial role in the strategy of a
human body movement [1].
Up to now, many related works have been done not
only in robotics, but also in physiological ﬁeld. These

have proposed several control strategies by combining a
feedforward with a feedback control manner. For instance,
Arimoto [2] proposed an iterative learning control scheme
that does not need any dynamical model in advance, and
Slotine [3] proposed a model based adaptive control scheme
that is able to compensate the model error in real-time. Also
Blana et al. [4] proposed a control scheme based on an
inverse dynamics model, and Katayama et al. [5] proposed
a parallel-hierarchical neural network model expanding the
feedback-error-learning scheme proposed by Kawato [1].
Blana’s and Katayama’s methods can accomplish a highly
accurate trajectory tracking. There are, however, still several
drawbacks in these previous methods that both the iterative
learning control scheme and Katayama’s method require a
number of trials to obtain a desired result, and the model
based adaptive control scheme and Blana’s method need an
accurate dynamical model in advance, and they all have
only applied to a trajectory tracking task. We also have
proposed another feedforward positioning method in which
the particular structure of the musculoskeletal system is
employed effectively [6], [7]. In this method, an arbitrary
constant muscular internal force, which is able to balance at
a desired position, is applied to the system as a feedforward
input. The arbitrary constant muscular internal force makes
a kind of potential ﬁeld, and the system is able to converge
on the desired position according to the potential ﬁeld
if it owns a unique equilibrium at the desired position.
The most remarkable advantage of this method is that no
sensing information is necessary to compose the controller.
However, its control performance in terms of response and
trajectory strongly depends on the shape of the potential
ﬁeld. Moreover, this ﬁeld depends not only on an initial and
desired position, but also on the magnitude of the constant
muscular internal force which can be chosen arbitrarily, and
its muscular arrangementwhich is hard to change once ﬁxed.
Thus, the muscular internal force must be chosen as large to
make a good performance wherever an initial and desired
position are.
This paper proposes a novel set-point control method for
the musculoskeletal system which combines the feedforward
control method with a visual feedback control method in-
cluding a considerable time-delay. This method allows the
musculoskeletal system to make a fast movement with much
smaller muscular internal force than the feedforward control
in our previous study, and also to make a robust positioning
against a considerable time-delay in the visual feedback.
The visual feedback control method is quite effective to
regulate the end-effector to the desired position accurately.

Meanwhile,it needs to take into accounta considerabletime-
delay due to a computational cost to extract meaningful
information from a raw image data, and an inadequate
sampling periodto capturean imagewhen using a commonly
utilized video frame rate camera. Accordingly, it is hard to
choose any feedback gain to be large enough because it
induces unstable phenomena. This fact leads to an insufﬁ-
cient performance in terms of agility and accuracy of the
set-point control. The visual feedback control using a high
speed camera has been being studied [8]; the high speed
camera is still not common, and we can perform a fast
motion by the combination of the feedforward and feedback
controlmanneralthoughwe do notpossess such a highspeed
visual sensor. Namely, this combination makes it possible to
overcome these drawbacks so that the feedforward manner
playsa roleinsuppressingan adverseeffectofthetime-delay
in the visual feedback signal, and the feedback manner plays
a role in reducing the necessary muscular internal force with
enough performances.
In what follows, the kinematics of the two-link six-muscle
musculoskeletalplanararmmodelusedinthisstudyis shown
in Section II. The new positioning method, which combines
the feedforward control signal with the visual feedback con-
trol signal includinga considerabletime-delay,is designedin
Section III. Finally, numerical simulation results are shown
in Section V to demonstrate the effectiveness of the new
positioning method. Additionally, the stability of the overall
system with the considerable time-delay using Lyapunov-
Krasovskii method [9], [10] is given brieﬂy in Appendix.
II. MUSCULOSKELETAL SYSTEM
Figure 1 shows a kinematic model of a musculoskeletal
arm model used in this study.This model is composedof two
jointsandsix muscles.Eachjointisdrivenbyrelated muscles
which can generate only a tensile force. In order to facilitate
the analysis, the muscles are assumed to be a massless line,
are ignored muscular viscoelasticity, and are attached to a
corresponding link directly. It means that a moment arm
of each muscle is changed depending on the joint angle.
Besides, each joint torque is also changed depending on the
joint angles even if the muscular tensile force is constant. In
this model, offset parameters in the muscular arrangement b
j
and d
j
(j=1, ··· , 4) are important to satisfy the stability
condition of the feedforward positioning [6]. Its movement
is limited within the horizontal plane (xy-plane) and thereby
the gravity effect can be ignored.In addition, assume that the
visual sensor used in the system is a commonly used video
frame rate camera.

III. CONTROL DESIGN
In this section, a new control signal is designed which
linearly combines the feedforward control manner for the
musculoskeletal system with a visual feedback control man-
ner including a considerable time-delay. Figure 2 shows a
block diagram of the overall system. The new control signal
? proposed here is given by the linear combination of the
feedforward and feedback signals as follows:
? = u
b
+ u
f
(11)
where u
b
? R
6
and u
f
? R
6
are the feedback and the
feedforward input vector, respectively. It is known that the
muscle is able to generate only a tensile force, that is, the
muscle cannot output a push force no matter how the control
signal ? demands any push force for the muscle. In order
for the tensile force to be a positive value, the control signal
must satisfy ?
i
>0(i=1, ··· , 6) during movement.Each
element of the feedforwardinput vector is given as a positive
value which will be shown in the following section. Thanks
to the feedforward input large enough, the control signal ?
i
is able to keep ?
i
> 0 during movement.
A. Feedforward Control Part

is given as follows [6]:

where W

is the constant Jacobian matrix from
the muscle space to the joint space at a desired position.
It is remarkable to note that the feedforward control input
makes the constant internal force v
d
?R
6
which balances at
the desired position. Also note that the feedforward control
signal has nothing to do with any time-delay in sensing
because of no sensory information.In this paper, an arbitrary
vectorofthefeedforwardinput k

as follows:
k
e
= ? [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]
T
, (13)
where,?> 0 signiﬁes a feedforward gain. The given con-
stant desired internal force balancing at the desired position
generates a potential ﬁeld, and the overall system is possible
to converge on the desired state according to the shape of
the potential ﬁeld if it has a unique stable equilibrium at
the desired state from the quasi-static viewpoint [6]. The
potential energy P is a nonlinear function depending on a
muscular arrangement and a given muscular internal force.

It needs further analysis in order to demonstrate whether
the potential possesses a unique equilibrium at the desired
position. Since it has been analyzing our another ongoing
study[7]andis notamainissue ofthispaper,weassumethat
the system generates a potential which possesses a unique
equilibrium at the desired position. Namely, the potential P
satisﬁes the following equations in this study.

B. Visual Feedback Control Part
The visual feedback control signal u

is given here. It
is a traditional task space PD feedback control method
except including a considerable time-delay. Assume that the
system treated here does not have any sensor other than a
single video frame rate camera. Namely, any information
used in this study is based on the end-point position x(t)
including the time-delay T obtained by the camera. The
visual feedback control signal including the time-delay T
is given as follows:

The total control signal is eventually given by the sum-
mation of (12) and (16). The stability of the overall system
is given brieﬂy in the Appendix.

strate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Physical

Each simulation result is shown in Figs. 3 ? 5. Figure 3
shows the transient responses of each x and y component of
the end-point position, and Fig. 4 shows the loci of the end-
point position in xy-plane. It can be seen from these ﬁgures
that the system is obviously getting unstable because of the
time-delay when using FB control. Of course by choosing
the feedback gains smaller, the end-point position is able
to converge on the desired position using FB control,but
in that case, it makes very low performance in terms of
response. In contrast, the end-pointposition convergeson the
desired position within at least 1.5 [s] when using FB+FF
controlorFFcontrol.Additionally,it can beseen fromFig.4
that both resulted end-point trajectories in xy-plane are quite
similar, and for that matter, FF control is slightly better than
FB+FF control in terms of response performance because
FF control has nothing to do with the time-delay. However,
Fig. 5 showing a comparison of the transient responses of
each muscular tensile force ?
i
, (i=1, ··· , 6) indicates
that the necessary muscular tensile force in FF control is
almost twice larger than that in FB+FF control. Namely,
FB+FF control is able to make a good performance as well
as FF control though its necessary muscular tensile force is
almost a half of FF control’s one.
We also perform other simulations in order to demonstrate
the effectiveness of the feedforward control input that plays
a role in suppressing unstable phenomena when using high
feedback gains. Each gain used in the simulations is shown
in Table V, and the results are shown in Fig. 6. It can
be seen from the ﬁgure that the end-point trajectory when
using only FB control with high feedback gains is obviously
getting unstable because of the large feedback gains. In
contrast, the end-point eventually converges on the desired

This fact obviously indicates that FF control plays a role
in suppressing unstable phenomena attributed to the large
time-delay and high feedback gains in FB control.
Through all the simulation results, we can conclude that
the proposed method is able to perform a stable and fast
reaching movement using less muscular forces even though
there exists the large time-delay.
V. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, the set-point control method of the muscu-
loskeletal system was newly proposed which combines the
visual feedback control with the considerable time-delay and
the feedforward control using the desired muscular internal
force. It was shown through numerical simulations that the

In our future works, an asymptotic stability of the overall
system has to be given, and the combination of the feedback
and feedforward manner would be optimized during move-
ment for the improvement of its performance, stability, and
robustness. Also its practical usefulness would be demon-
strated through experiments.
APPENDIX
The dynamic stability of the overall system including the
time-delay is discussed here by using Lyapunov-Krasovskii

The scalar function V decreases with respect to time t if (28)
satisﬁes. Thus, it needs to satisfy the following inequality in
order to satisfy (28).
z(t)
2
>
?
?
z(t? T)
2
. (29)
If (29) is satisﬁed, ?x(t) and ˙ x(t) approach to zero as
t?∞.Incontrast,
˙
V becomespositiveandthen V increases
with time t if (29) is not satisﬁed. In such a case, z(t)
and ˙ x(t) also increase and this eventually may induce some
unstable phenomenon. The increase of V, however, means
that the end-point leaves far from the desired position x
d
.In
that case, z(t) and z(t? T) intuitively satisfy the following
inequality.
z(t) >z(t? T). (30)
Eventually, V decreases again since (29) satisﬁes. Namely,
the state is ultimately bounded. In this paper, the diagonal
elements of the feedback gain K
p
are set to be the same
value. That is, ?
min
[K
p
] is equal to ?
max
[K
p
], and thereby
the allowable time-delay for maintaining the ultimately
boundedness must beT< 1.0 [s] from (27).
