Abstract— This paper presents a methodology and validation
of print-and-self-fold electric devices. For printing functional
structures for robotic use, we realize electric circuitry based on
metallic polyester ﬁlm (MPF). By exploiting the unique material
properties of MPF, we developed fundamental electric devices,
namely a resistor, capacitor, and inductor. The developed
polyvinyl chloride laminated MPF sheet shows reliable self-
folding processes under a heat application, and it conﬁgures
3D electric devices. Due to the pre-resolved kinematic design,
these devices feature elasticity, making them suitable as sensors
and actuators in soft circuits. Here we testify to a self-assembled
variable resistor and capacitive strain sensor. An actuation
mechanism consisting of a folded contractible coil is also
considered and shown. Finally, an RLC circuit obtained from
the integration of all the developed devices is demonstrated, in
which the coil based actuator is controlled by reading a variable
capacitive strain sensor.
I. INTRODUCTION
A techniquefor“printing”a functionalrobotis a futuristic
dream of many engineers, and success promises to entirely
change the method of robot fabrication. Recent progress
in the printability of 3D structures has provided engineers
with fast and easy access to rapid prototyping techniques,
enhancing the speed of development. The challenge now
shifts to the printability of the “brain part”, namely the
electronics and the controlling methods. Toward this end,
we develop a method and technique for self-assembling
conductive materials to desired functional formations.
Recently, various types of robots have been fabricated
through folding processes, inspired by folding-based assem-
bly techniques, such as Origami art work. Roach is a 2.4g
autonomous hexapod robot with a body shape made through
folding and assembling processes [1]. Onal et al. developed
inchworm robots by patterning a single Polyester sheet and

and Miyashita et al. achieved self-pop-up of a cylindrical

A technique for making mm-scale robots using the pop-
up method was developed by [8]. A theoretical framework
for designing pop-up parallel folds was presented in [9]. A
recent series of achievements in folding at MEMS scale was
shownin[10].One-dimensionalstructurefoldingusingDNA
origami was realized in [11], and it was inspired by protein
foldingsin[12]–[14].Elastomer-basedfoldingtechniquesare
presented in [15].
Recent advances in realizing soft electronics provide ver-
satility in stretchability, compressibility, twistability, bend-
ability, and deformability for arbitrary shapes of electron-
ics [16]–[20].
Toward the realization of “printing”electronics for robots,
this paper investigates a method of print-and-fold for basic
electric components with built-in components. The contribu-
tions of this paper are:
1) We developed a method of realizing resistance, capac-
itance, and inductance through the use of a metalized
polyester sheet.
2) We advanced a technique of sheet self-folding and
achieved self-assembly of conductive material.
3) We designed a variable resistor and capacitive strain

tric devices and attained an origami coil actuation

new devices can be composed.
II. GENERAL PRINCIPLES&METHODS
Our technical approach for realizing resistors, capacitors,
and inductors exploits the conductivity and resistivity using
the structure or geometry of material sheets. In particular,
we use 50.1?m thick isotropic aluminum coating (one side)
polyester ﬁlm (MPF, Mylar).
A speciﬁc resistance can be attained by varying the
material’s geometry. Thus, a 3 ? 3cm square cut of MPF
has about ≈ 4.4Ω. The resistance can be linearly increased
by lengthening the MPF, and inversely, can be decreased by
narrowing the width of the sheet. By translating this cutting-
and-regulating approach to folding methods, we can realize
elastic resistors of various resistances (the limit is given by
the geometry).
Since the resistance of the MPF is relatively low as the
sheet resistance ≈1Ω, it can be used as a conductive cable
in short-length circuitry. Because the resistivity is not as
negligible as that of copper, such a conductive cable is more
suitable for digital circuits.
Capacitors can be obtained using two electrically isolated
MPF. Capacitance of two parallel MPF is proportionalto the
surface area andinverseproportionalto the distance between
the plates. Thus, the capacitance magnitude can be regulated
by the arrangement and the geometry of the paired surfaces.
In a folding fashion, we realized a capacitor by pairing
angled MPF surfaces, where a shared edge forms the hinge
between the tiles. This way, for example,two square MPF of
2?2cm
2
spanninganangleof45
?
witha 2mmgapfromthe
shared edge exhibits a capacitance of ≈ 0.4pF. Due to the
factthatthecapacitanceincreasesroughlyproportionaltothe
surfacearea, thesize ofthe deviceinﬂuencesthe capacitance
magnitude.
The inductor is the resistivity of a structure against the
current change, and the typical type is also known as a coil.
To show the capability of self-assembly in realizing folded
3D structures that satisfy the topology of an inductor, we
designed a self-assembled solenoid coil. The coil can create
a magnetic ﬁeld within a certain volume, which can subse-
quently be used for actuation mechanisms, as introduced in
Section VI-C. The inductance is determined by the number
of turns as well as the geometry(size). For instance, an MPF
solenoid coil with radius 16mm, height 6mm, and 5 turns
theoretically shows 2.10?H.
Tests with an MPF-based inductor showed that it can
sustain up to an ≈ 300mA current before an instant loss
of conductivity occurs due to changes in the characteristic
of the polyester layer produced by heat. MPF maintains
conductivity as well as resistivity given the non-harsh itera-
tive foldings. The sheet can withstand a temperature range
of ?45
?

C, making the material a poor candidate
for soldered connections. Therefore, conductive connections
in the circuit were made using conductive tape, conductive
epoxy glue, and mechanical clippings.
III. SELF-FOLDING MPF BY GLOBAL HEAT
Among the various types of existing self-folding tech-
niques, we have developed a simultaneous multi-crease self-
folding technique based on global heating with a heat sensi-
tive sheet (Poly-Vinyl Chloride; PVC, Shrink Bag, shrinking

properties, such as the folded sheet structure, kinematics,
and circuit topology, we derived the crease pattern for
self-folding considering all conditions (Fig. 2(a)?(b)). The
unique characteristics of this approach are: (1) it has a
three-layer structure in which creases bend to the wider
opening sides of gaps (Fig. 2(d)(e)), (2) the geometry of
the surface, height, width, and thickness in Fig. 2(a) can be
encoded in Fig. 2(b) and reﬂected in Fig. 2(f), (3) there
are driving (or input) angles and driven (output) angles,
and the accurate driven angles are roughly controlled by
the driving angles (using pop-up Angle folds) (Fig. 2(f)),
(4) with the exception of the laser cutting step, the entire
process is completed without the assistance of equipment,
(5) the conductivesurface in the self-folded3D structure can
be exposed or hidden depending on which side of the MPF
faces up in the lamination phase in Fig. 2(c), and (6) further
lamination of the layers is possible to provide additional
functionalities. Conductivityis maintained via “bridges” that
link the conductive tiles (Fig. 2(c)), which also keeps the
tiles from coming closer and bending in the wrong direction
when heated. Note that due to the torque required, bridges
can only be placed over mountain folds. The total thickness
1447
of the self-folding sheet is 0.3mm. See [7] for more details
about fabrication.

and Angle folds, and we manually folded as described in the
crease pattern. This way, the structure features an excellent
extension rate of over 100 times (≈ 118 times) and shows
good tensile strength.

comparing (b) and (h), it can be derived that the position
of a bridge does not affect the resistance. We hypothesize
that the resistance of a sheet, R

connections of the i-th (i ? N) surfacial geometric portion
that attributes the resistance R

B. Shape Optimization for Linear Output
In this work, we plan to use the capacitance change as
a sensor. In this respect, the high degree of nonlinearity
acrosstherangeofsin? becomesanissue.Wehavetherefore
attempted to optimize the shape of the tiles, in order for
the capacitance to exhibit linear behavior with the change
of sin?. To this end, we modeled the capacitance with the
additional geometric variables of r

varied from 1mm to

To this end, we optimized l

=14.7mm as the optimized geometry.
We validated the results by experimentally measuring the
capacitance value with the same arrangement. Here, we
tested two conﬁgurations: (1) both tiles with fully overlap-
ping triangles, namely r=3mm, and (2) with the obtained
optimal geometry regarding linearity, as produced by our
model. The comparison between experimental and modeled
results are shown in Fig. 9. We plot the data in different
scales, as our model does not consider tile thickness and
edge effects are not modeled, and thus the absolute values
of capacitances are different between the model and the
real measurement. The full triangle pattern shows a higher
capacitance range than the optimal design. As suggested by
the model, the optimized design is shown to be linear across
the optimized range of 30

An improvement in the output linearity can be recognized (note
that the small windows are plot in normal scale, with a support of
linear dash-dotted lines for reference).
The designed crease pattern, which is shown in Fig. 10(a),

is shown in Fig. 10(b). Through global heating, the sheet
reliably folds 100 creases simultaneously and self-assembles
into theintended3Dstrain sensor.Notethat allthenecessary
circuitry has also been completed, and the structure is ready
to use. Due to the kinematics of the structure, it can be
compressed to the range shown in the small window in
Fig. 10(c). When the force is released, the structure expands

as shown in Fig. 12(c). Note that due to the kinematics, the
coil can be compressed. Wheeler’s formula predicted L =
0.52?H, though the value was too small to measure with an
LCR meter.
C. Application to Actuation Mechanism
In order to demonstrate the effect of the magnetic ﬁeld
generated by a folded solenoid coil, we further investigated
the possibility of realizing an actuation mechanism. The
basicideawas derivedfromtheconceptsbehinda voicecoil,
in which an electrical coil generates a force that acts on a
permanent magnet, generating sound. Our approach was to
haveacompressibleorigamicoilwithtwoferrouscylindrical
cores suspended inside both ends. When the current was run
throughthecoil,theferrouscoreswithinbecomemagnetized
in the same direction and attracted each other (Fig. 13(a)).
The coil contracted due to the attractive force between the
ferrous cores. Part of this idea can be found in microrobotics
[24], where a microrobot equipped with two soft magnets
changed the magnets’ distance using an externally applied
resonant magnetic ﬁeld, thereby attaining locomotion.
In practice, MPF was unable to run sufﬁcient current
for actuation at this scale. We therefore utilized a manu-
ally folded 24-winding copper-based origami coil with the
same folding geometry pattern as Fig. 12, insulating the

we used a 6.3mm diameter ferrous cylinder (bolt) for the
upper end and an 11.1mm diameter ferrous cylinder for the
lower end.While measurementswith the LCR meter showed
L=4.6?H, Wheeler’s formula predicted L=5.0?H.
Fig. 14 shows the magnetic ﬂux density generated by the
origami coil. A linear increase in the strength can be seen in
proportion to the current increase.

applyingcurrenttotheorigamicoil,thestructurecompressed
due to the attraction between the cores, and millimeter-level
actuation was achieved. At 5A of current, a ≈ 0.8mm
contraction (≈ 3.57% compression) was observed in the
structure. We are supposing that the contraction level can be
improved using a thinner insulation layer, a larger number
of coil windings, and a higher current application. The non-
linearity against an increase in current comes from the effect
of the distance between the two cores, whose magnitude of

We read the MPF capacitivestrain sensor data with an Ar-

and 220Ω), and we controlled the magnetic ﬁeld strength
generated by the origami-coil actuator as the linear output
of the strain value of the MPF capacitive strain sensor. We
incorporated the MPF resistor into the circuit as the 220Ω

resistor. A range of 30 to 60pF of optimized capacitance,
regulated manually through compression, is linearly mapped
to a 0 to 5A current range in order to power the origami-
coil actuator. Fig. 16 shows the experimental setup and the
control diagram. With the compression of the capacitive
strain sensor, we observed the compression of the origami-
coil actuator together with the generation of a magneticﬁeld
from the origami-coil. The demonstration, which are shown

developed devices.
VIII. DISCUSSION&CONCLUSION
In this paper, we presented the method, development, and
usageofself-foldingelectricdevices.WecombinedMPFand
a heat-sensitive shrinking ﬁlm to self-fold structures by ap-
plyingglobalheat.Thus,thefoldedstructureischaracterized
by both conductivityand elasticity, making it appropriatefor
elastic electric devices, such as a variable resistor, a strain
sensor,and a voice-coilbased actuator.We optimized the tile
shape of the capacitive sensor and improved its output lin-
earity with respect to the deformation level of the structure.
The result indicates that the compulsorycircuit topologycan
co-exist with the capability of self-assembly while satisfying
the required kinematics. We further integrated these devices
and demonstrated a basic sensor-motor control by reading
the strain of the capacitive sensor and regulating the folded
coil-based actuator.
The novel electric devices have unique properties due
to the underlying material and the fabrication process. The
developed MPF resistors have limitations in terms of the
resistance output compared to normal resistors, which at-
tain a few mega ohm keeping their size. Nonetheless, the
structurefeatureselasticity and tangibilityin fabrication.The
maximum value of the MPF capacitor is in the pF range.
This implies that an appropriateuse for these capacitors is as
sensors, as they showed reliable and repeatable outputs. The
limited current capacity that the MPF coil currently supports
is not a negligible issue, but it will be addressed further in
order to create actuation mechanisms of signiﬁcant output.
In summary, the methodology showed the potential of
using a conductive polyester sheet for electric devices by
means of a simple and cheap printing-based fabrication
and a reliable self-folding process. In addition to pursuing
the creation of a wide functional platform based on the
presented methodology, we will continue to improve the
entire automation process.
