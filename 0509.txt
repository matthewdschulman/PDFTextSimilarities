Abstract—In this paper, experimental studies of bilateral 
teleoperation control of a quadrotor system are presented. Not 
only position control but force control of a quadrotor system is 
regulated by forming a force controlled loop. The contact force is 
measured by a load cell mounted on the top of the quadrotor 
system. The sensed force is used for a haptic device as an 
operator feels the force. This configuration forms the bilateral 
teleoperation control system. Contact force of a quadrotor 
system in the altitude direction is regulated by the command 
from the master. The quadrotor system is controlled by a master 
to fly up from the ground to the ceiling, and to maintain desired 
contact force against the ceiling, and finally to land back on the 
ground. This experimental work mimics the possible ceiling task 
performed by a quadrotor system to see the feasibility of 
applying the force control technique to the quadrotor system. 
Experimental studies confirm the feasible force control 
performance. 
 
I. INTRODUCTION 
ESEARCH on quadrotor systems becomes quite active in 
control and robot communities so as to develop them as 
an unmanned aerial vehicle(UAV) for various purposes. Like 
other UAVs, quadrotor systems are mainly used to perform 
surveillance tasks by monitoring related areas. Quadrotor 
systems have several advantages of omni-directional 
movements, better maneuverability, simple structures, and 
better hovering performance over conventional UAVs [1-3].  
Challenging flying demonstration of quadrotor systems are 
conducted in indoor environment since keen position control 
performance can be achieved due to the accurate 
measurements of position of quadrotor systems. Without 
disturbance like wind, quadrotor systems can be accurately 
controlled in indoor environment relying upon expensive and 
accurate motion capture systems. 
Recently, quadrotor systems are practically used to monitor 
outdoor environment and their activities lead to the social

issue of invading privacy.  
Although we have the social issue of the invasion of privacy, 
research on quadrotor systems is enormously increasing. A 
majority of research on quadrotor systems is to improve the 
performance of attitude control with various control 
algorithms [4-11]. Vision-based tracking control of quadrotor 
systems is presented [12-14]. Aggressive driving control 
performance of several quadrotor systems has been 
demonstrated by University of Pennsylvania, USA. Fast 
maneuvering control of quadrotors systems is well 
demonstrated. Inverted pendulum on the quadrotor is 
controlled to maintain balance. Furthermore, the challenging 
demonstration of the pole passing task between two 
quadrotors is demonstrated by ETH.  Initially, a pole is located 
on the top of quadrotor system maintaining balance. Then the 
quadrotor passes the pole to another quadrotor so that the 
receiver receives the pole and maintains balance nicely.  
Different mechanism of a quadrotor system have been 
designed for both flying and driving [15,16]. The flymobile is 
designed for both driving and flying performances by using 
the tilting mechanism of each rotor [16]. Tilt up position of 
each rotor for flying and tilt down position for driving are 
utilized for different modes. An acceleration-based 
disturbance observer is designed for the robust attitude control 
[17,18]. 
The aforementioned research results regarding quadrotor 
systems are dependent upon the accurate measurement of 
position that leads to the good hovering performance which is 
one of the advantages of quadrotor systems. Well-maintained 
hovering performance of the quadrotor system allows the 
system to monitor objects for outdoor surveillance tasks. 
Furthermore, hovering performance can be extended for the 
feasible application of constrained tasks with environments. 
Research on constrained motion control of quadrotor systems 
is rare in the literature, but challenging [19-21]. Lateral force 
control of a quadrotor system is presented [19]. Lateral force 
is generated by an extra rotor to make contact with wall for 
possible tasks on the wall. 
In this paper, a scenario of changing light bulb on the ceiling 
is simulated. The contact force control application of a 
quadrotor system with the desk that mimics the task on the 
ceiling is presented along with position control. Fig.1 shows 
the concept of force control application of a quadrotor system. 
Force in the altitude direction is regulated. The quadrotor 
system is controlled remotely by the haptic device, which 
forms the bilateral teleoperation system.

In addition, a haptic device as a master and a quadrotor 
system as a slave robot form a bilateral teleoperation control 
system. The master controls the quadrotor system to fly up 
from the ground, and to make contact with the ceiling(desk). 
The quadrotor system is required to maintain contact against 
the ceiling with desired force commanded by the operator and 
to land on the ground.  
To our knowledge, contact force control of a quadrotor 
system in the configuration of bilateral teleoperation is the first 
appearance in the literature. Experimental studies confirm the 
proposed force control performance.

III. ATTITUDE CONTROL SCHEMES 
Prior to applying force control to the quadrotor system, the 
hovering control performance should be guaranteed.  For the 
hovering control performance, Euler angles and altitude are 
controlled. Here a linear control method is used for attitude 
control. Each control input to the angle is defined as

IV. BILATERAL TELEOPERATION CONTROL 
 
In the configuration of bilateral teleoperation control, there 
are several procedures to close the control loop. Firstly, the 
master haptic device commands the quadrotor system to fly up. 
Secondly, the quadrotor system makes contact with the 
environment and sensed contact force. Thirdly, the sensed 
force is transferred to the haptic device so that the operator 
feels the contact force.  
The haptic device as the master and a quadrotor system as 
the slave form a bilateral teleoperation structure shown in Fig. 
4. The key performance of the teleoperation task is the 
transparency such that the operator feels the same contact 
force as the slave feels. 
The closed loop transfer function of the slave is given by

In our system, the z direction of the altitude direction is 
force controlled. The contact force of the quadrotor system is 
sensed by a load cell and fed back to the haptic device as a 
spring constant so that the applied force has linear relationship 
with the spring constant considered as

Fig.4 Bilateral teleoperation 
 
A bilateral teleoperation task is configured by forming a 
master robot, haptic device and a slave robot, quadrotor 
system.  Fig.5 explains the structure of the bilateral 
teleoperation system. As an operator controls the Phantom 
omni haptic device, the quadrotor system moves after that.  
Force induced by the quadrotor system in the altitude direction 
is regulated.  
For the sensing of contact force in the altitude direction, a 
load cell is designed and mounted on the top of the quadrotor 
system. The sensed force is transferred to the computer in the 
ground and used it for the haptic device as a force feedback. 
Force feedback to the haptic device can be calculated with a 
spring constant and a height.

V. EXPERIMENT 
A. Experimental Setup 
The experimental setup of bilateral teleoperation is 
described in Fig. 6 and 7. The master, a haptic device and the 
slave, a quadrotor system are described in Fig. 6 and 7, 
respectively. The master robot is a commercial haptic device 
and is connected to the computer which is remotely located. 
Then the command signals are passed through the wireless 
communication between the computer and the quadrotor 
system. The commanded signals include Euler angles, altitude, 
and force data. 
The Euler angles are controlled by the haptic device. The 
end position of the haptic device indicates the height of the 
quadrotor system so that positioning the end position of the 
device controls actually the height of the quadrotor system. 
545
 
 
 
The quadrotor system is required to push against the desk 
by maintaining a desired force commanded from the haptic 
device. Several different force levels are applied and tested. 
The ceiling is located 1m away from the ground. The haptic 
device controls the height of the quadrotor system.

Fig. 7 Slave robot under the ceiling 
 
The slave robot, the quadrotor system, is equipped with a 
force sensor made of a strain gauge which measures force in 
one direction. Fig. 8(a) shows the load cell attached to the top 
of the quadrotor system. To reduce the contact overshoot, soft 
materials are placed on the top of the system as shown in Fig. 
8(b).  This part can be replaced with a manipulator for possible 
applications.

B. Experimental Results 
Experimental demonstration is displayed in Fig. 9. Several 
image cuts are shown to demonstrate the experimental process. 
Initially the quadrorotor system is located on the ground (Fig. 
9 (a)). As the operator moves the haptic device up, the 
quadrotor flies up (Fig. 9 (b)) and makes contact with the desk 
(Fig. 9 (c)). The quadrotor system maintains a certain force for 
a while (Fig. (d)). Finally, the quadrotor lands back on the 
ground (Fig. 9 (e,f)). 
A constant force is applied to the haptic device so that the 
quadrotor system also maintains contact with the desk with the 
applied force. Firstly, the operator applies 30gf(0.3N) to the 
haptic device. The corresponding force plots are shown in Fig. 
10 (a). Contact has been made around 13 seconds and force 
overshoot is about 35 gf. The corresponding height is also 
plotted in the same figure. The height is measured by a 
distance sensor. The plot indicates that the height is 100cm.

Secondly, the operator pushes more to have 40 gf(0.4N).  
At around 12seconds in Fig. 10(b), the quadrotor made contact 
with the desk, which shows about 50% force overshoot of 80gf. 
Then the quadrotor settles down to 40 gf at around 15 seconds. 
It maintains at 40gf for the time being, then it flies down on the 
ground as the operator releases it. The height data seem noisy 
because the vibration of the quadrotr system was passed to the 
sensor. 
 
546
 
 
 
Lastly, we increase the contact force to 70gf(0.69N). For 
the case of 70gf force, Fig. 10 (c) shows the resulting contact 
force of 70 gf. We observed the smaller force overshoot less 
than 5%. A contact force error is smaller than that of 
40gf(0.4N). This is because the larger force is easy to maintain 
due to the low resolution of the sensor.

The corresponding altitude data are also plotted in Fig. 10. 
The altitude data of 70gf force is also better with less 
oscillation. 
As a result, all three cases of different desired forces are 
well regulated although the quadrotor introduces vibration. 
Although there are vibrations, the quadrotor system does not 
lose contact with the wall. Experimental studies confirm the 
possible application of quad-rotor systems in the constrained 
tasks.  
However, there are many problems to be solved.  Firstly, 
the time-delay problem of the network which is a major 
problem in the teleoperation control should be addressed.  
Secondly, the resolution of the force sensor should be 
improved. Thirdly, force control algorithm is required to be 
upgraded. 
 
VI. CONCLUSION 
This paper presents the teleoperation control application 
during the feasible scenario of changing a light bulb on the 
ceiling. Experimental studies confirm the feasibility of 
applying a force control technique to the quadrotor system in 
the configuration of bilateral teleoperation. Although the 
environment is simplified as a desk to check the contact force 
regulation in the bilateral teleoperation configuration, 
experimental studies have shown that the quadrotor is well 
regulated with applied forces from the master device. This is 
the positive sign for further research on the contact force 
control application.  
In the other hand, there are several problems to be solved 
in the future. The time delay issue in the communication 
channel is a well-known problem and has to be solved in the 
future. Since the resolution of the load cell is low, it is required 
to have the better sensor to achieve more accurate force 
control tasks. The quadrotor has to be redesigned and rebuilt 
to generate higher force and payload for real applications to 
satisfy desired specifications.
