Bracing the Human Body with Supernumerary Robotic Limbs for
Physical Assistance and Load Reduction
Federico Parietti, Kameron Chan and H. Harry Asada, Member, IEEE
Abstract— A new approach to physically assisting the human
with a wearable robot is presented. Supernumerary Robotic
Limbs (SRLs) attached to the human waist support the body
efﬁciently when the human is taking fatiguing postures, e.g.
hunching over, squatting, or reaching the ceiling. Unlike a leg
exoskeleton, where powered joints are attached to the human
joints and are constrained to move together with the human
limb, the SRL can take an arbitrary posture to maximize the
load bearing efﬁciency. Taking a near-singular conﬁguration,
the SRL can bear a large load with small power consumption.
First, the “bracing” strategy for supporting the human body
is described, followed by a mathematical analysis of the load
bearing efﬁciency. The optimal SRL posture and joint torques
are then obtained in order to minimize the human load.
Numerical and experimental results using a prototype of the
SRL demonstrate the effectiveness of the method.
I. INTRODUCTION
Industrial automation has revolutionized a wide range of
production processes, from car manufacturing to micropro-
cessor fabrication. However, one of the most technologically
advanced industry sectors – aircraft manufacturing – has so
far made a limited use of robotic technology, and relies
heavily on skilled workforce. In this paper we present the
design and control strategy of a wearable robot aimed to as-
sist aircraft assembly workers, augmenting their capabilities
and reducing their workload.
Human workers are essential for aircraft assembly be-
cause of three main reasons. First, the assembly process is
characterized by a wide range of complex tasks and by a
ﬂexible schedule, which must be modiﬁed if the need for
reworks arises. Trained workers have the capability to easily
learn new tasks, and the ﬂexibility to coordinate with each
other and modify their work plans. Second, aircraft assembly
entails the use of special scaffolds and tools designed for
human workers. Traditional industrial robots do not meet
the size and safety requirements to operate in such tight
spaces, cannot operate hand tools, and are not capable of
quickly navigating through complex scaffolds. Third, the
large size of aircraft and their small lot size (compared
to mass consumer goods) excludes the use of traditional
automated assembly lines where the process is decomposed

into simple independent operations that can be execute by
industrial robots.
Although the aircraft assembly process requires abilities
that are unique to human workers – such as learning and
ﬂexibility – it would also beneﬁt from advantages of robotic
technology like precision and strength. In particular, many
assembly tasks impose a heavy workload on humans, re-
sulting in fatigue and injury and decreased productivity [1].
For example, lifting large parts and operating heavy tools
require exerting signiﬁcant forces for prolonged periods of
time. Moreover, working on hard-to-reach locations such as
the ﬂoor or the ceiling of the aircraft fuselage forces humans
to assume uncomfortable postures – stooped, crouched, or
stretched. These requirements become even more problem-
atic if we consider that aircraft assembly workforce is
characterized by a particularly marked aging trend, with a
median age of about 48 years [2].
In this context, it would be beneﬁcial to provide workers
with robotic assistants able to help with the most physi-
cally demanding tasks, while leaving humans in complete
control of the assembly process. If these robotics assistants
were wearable, they could reach an unprecedented level of
coordination with the human users, eventually becoming
functional extensions of their bodies. To realize this vision,
we designed and built the Supernumerary Robotic Limbs
(SRL), a wearable robot which augments its wearer by pro-
viding two additional robotic arms [3] [4]. Unlike traditional

the elbow, one in the wrist). The elbow actuator trasmits torque to its joint

upper or lower limb exoskeletons, where powered joints are
attached to the corresponding human joints, the SRL is not
constrained to follow the movements of the human (Figure
1). Its robotic limbs are free to move independently, and can
therefore assume the posture that best helps the wearer. This
unique characteristic of the SRL has been exploited in order
to stabilize the user during tasks that require high accuracy
[5]. In this paper we present a method for supporting the
human upper body when the worker has to stoop or crouch
for a long time. By bracing the body against a wall, ﬂoor,
and other structures the SRL can effectively bear the upper
body load during fatiguing tasks. Furthermore, we show that
the independent kinematic structure of the SRL allows for
more efﬁcient load bearing compared to leg exoskeletons.
The paper is organized as follows. Section II brieﬂy
describes the design concept of the SRL. Section III in-
troduces a bracing strategy for load bearing, and analyzes
the power efﬁciency and load bearing capacity of SRLs in
comparison with leg exoskeletons. Section IV formulates an
optimization problem for ﬁnding an optimal posture and
torque distribution of SRL so that the human effort for
bearing the load may be a minimum. Section V discusses
and extends the optimization results. Finally, Section VI
summarizes the most important contributions of this study.
II. ROBOT DESIGN
The SRL consists of a pair of wearable robotic limbs that
can intuitively and safely assist the human (Figure 2). A de-
tachable 3D printed waist brace forms the interface between
the human and the SRLs base structure. Its ergonomic shape
ensures that the robot rests on the iliac crest, the thick edge
of the hip bone, and that the robots weight is directed to
the legs and away from the spine [4]. Shoulder straps and a
waist belt secure the SRL to the user. Each robotic limb is
attached to a side of the base structure, and is provided with
4 degrees of freedom – two near the base (shoulder), one in
the middle (elbow), and one at the end effector (wrist). The
range of the robot joints allows the end effectors to reach
the majority of the human limbs workspace (both legs and
arms) in order to provide assistance where needed.
The speciﬁcations of the joints are designed to match
human performance in terms of torque and weight [3]. The
shoulder ﬂexion joint, which is the most powerful joint
and has to lift objects in front of the human, has a 270-
degree range of motion and a maximum torque of 69 Nm.
The shoulder abduction and elbow ﬂexion joints, which
are orthogonal to the shoulder ﬂexion joint and experience
little gravity load, have a maximum torque of 39 Nm. The
shoulder abduction joint has a 90-degree range of motion,
while the elbow ﬂexion joint has a 180-degree range of
motion. Each joint is actuated by a brushless DC motor
through a Harmonic Drive gearbox (50:1).
To minimize the robotic limbs moment of inertia and
to reduce power consumption, the elbow actuator is placed
immediately behind the shoulder as a counterweight. Torque
is then transmitted to the elbow using two 12 mm wide, 5
mm pitch GT2 timing belts. The robotic arms are designed
to allow internal routing of signal and power wires for the
end effectors. A series viscoelastic element having stiffness
of 153 Nm/rad is placed between each joint and its gearbox.
This added elasticity a) decouples the gearbox and motor, b)
provides low-cost and robust torque sensing (using encoders
to measure deﬂection), and c) guarantees safety in case
of impact [6] [7] [8]. The viscoelastic element, made of
polyurethane rubber, allows the achievement of the desired
joint stiffness with a signiﬁcant reduction in mass and size
with respect to a traditional steel coil spring [3].
One additional degree of freedom is placed at the wrist,
and controlled with a servo motor. The robotic arm can be
equipped with various end effectors, tailored for different
tasks. For this study, an electromagnet (weight: 275 g, max
holding force: 490.5 N) is mounted on the wrist output
ﬂange (see Figure 2, insert). The electromagnet allows the
robotic arm to easily make contact with the environment.
The wrist actuator is used to orient the outer surface of the
magnet (a disk with D = 50 mm) so that it is parallel to
the desired surface of contact. The magnetic force is then
activated and guarantees a ﬁrm grip. This hoding system
is faster and avoids the extra weight and complexity of a
robotic gripper or hand. If the environment does not present
any ferromagnetic surfaces, a vacuum gripper (such as the
Joulin FlexiGrip GS120) could replace the electromagnetic
end effector. Vacuum can be created with a Venturi valve,
using the compressed air system available in the aircraft
factory.
III. BRACING AND LOAD BEARING ANALYSIS
A. The Bracing Strategy
Workers in the aircraft assembly process must perform
complex tasks, requiring high precision and substantial phys-
ical effort. The SRL assists the human in these demanding
142
situations, increasing their accuracy and reducing their fa-
tigue. In this section we present the strategy used by the
SRL to provide support to the wearer, and analyze the
effectiveness of load bearing in comparison to exoskeletons.
Unlike an exoskeleton, where powered joints are attached
to the human joints and move together with the human,
the Supernumerary Robotic Limbs can make contact with
the environment at any point within their workspace. By
grasping or clamping structural elements such as aircraft
beams or safety scaffolds, they can secure the human body
to the environment, and thereby suppress disturbances and
lower the load to be borne by the human. In other words,
this strategy allows the robot to brace the human body against
an external structure. Therefore, we call it the “bracing
strategy”.
In a previous study, the bracing strategy has been applied
to increase the equivalent stiffness at the hip of the user,
thereby reducing disturbances and increasing accuracy [5].
In this paper, we will apply the bracing strategy in order to
minimize the torques that the human joints must exert to hold
a weight or to keep an uncomfortable position. An exemplary
case study considered in this paper is to support an aircraft
assembly worker in performing a task on the ﬂoor or at a very
low position of the airplane structure. Examples of such tasks
include fuselage assembly, routing wires, fastening seats, and
performing quality checks. All of these operations require
holding a crouched position for extended periods of time,
suppressing oscillatory movements, and stabilizing the body
in order to guarantee the precision of the task execution.
Maintaining uncomfortable postures may accelerate fatigue
of the workers, reducing their productivity and even posing
risks to their health [1]. Wearable robots such as exoskeletons
or the SRL can be used to support the workers and reduce
their fatigue. In this study, we will focus on load bearing
capacity and compare the efﬁciency and effectiveness of
SRLs bracing strategy against leg exoskeletons. We consider
the case where the worker is standing in front of the aircraft
fuselage with both feet in contact with the ﬂoor, and the torso
is leaning forward in order to perform the assembly task at
a low position.
Figure 3 shows the kinematic model used for analyzing
the load bearing characteristics of the SRL bracing strategy
compared to a leg exoskeleton. Four simplifying assumptions
have been adopted in the analysis of the problem. First, the
model is composed by rigid links and rotational joints, and
neglects the compliance of the human-robot interface. It also
lumps SRL base and human torso in a single rigid body.
These simpliﬁcations are possible because small deﬂections
due to compliance do not inﬂuence the static distribution
of torques between the robot and the human, which is the
objective of this analysis. Second, we assume that the robot
can securely grip the environment, e.g. a fuselage structure,
so that no slip occurs at the contact point. This can be
achieved using an electromagnet whose holding force can
generate enough static friction to secure the grip (see Section
II). Third, the analysis assumes that the robot links as well
as the human and exoskeleton links are mass less. The effect
of link mass can be included, but it makes the analysis
unnecessarily complex. Finally, the model considers half of
the human-robot system: it includes one human leg and one
robotic limb.
As shown in Figure 3, the system consists of one SRL,
human leg and torso. The position and orientation of the
human torso that is aligned with the SRL base is denoted
by a 3-dim vector, p = [x

B. Load Bearing Analysis
The basic equations that describe the static torque-force
relationships of the system are as follows. For the robotic
limb, the endpoint forces F

R

where the vector 
R
contains the torques at the joints of
the robotic arm (wrist, elbow and shoulder). An analogous
expression can be written for the human leg. In this case, the
torques are referred to the ankle, knee and hip joints of the
human. The expressions of the robot and human Jacobians
J
R
and J
H
are reported in Appendix A.
Consider the total power consumed at the SRL for bearing
the load. The power consumption can be written as

interest is to assist the human when he/she has to squat in
order to reach a very low point, as illustrated in Figure 3.
At this posture, the exoskeleton, which has to take the same
posture as the human, is not advantageous; the exoskeleton
must bear the load in the same way as the human. To
compare the load bearing efﬁciency, consider the quotient

It is expected that the quotient  is smaller than 1 if
the SRL takes a proper posture by bracing the human body
against a wall, the ﬂoor, or a structure that it can contact. It is
natural to assume that the posture of the exoskeleton as well
as the human leg is not singular when half way crouching, as
illustrated in Figure 3. Therefore, matrix B is assumed non-
singular. Since the matrix A is symmetry and the matrix B is
symmetry and non-singular, the quotient can be treated as a
Rayleigh Quotient. Finding the minimum of the quotient is a
generalized eigenvalue problem, and is given by the smallest
eigenvalue of the following matrix:

If the SRL is at a singular conﬁguration, it can bear a load
with zero power consumption, as long as the load vector F
is in the null space of matrix A:

min
= 0; P
R
= 0 for F2N(A) (9)
The Rayleigh quotient is small even at a non-singular SRL
conﬁguration, if the SRL posture is near singular and the load
vector is nearly aligned with the null space of matrix A.
The SRL can take various conﬁgurations. Finding a right
posture for bracing the human body is critically important for
lowering the Rayleigh quotient, i.e. efﬁcient load bearing.
The following section will address how to ﬁnd the right
posture that optimizes the metric subject to constraints on
available surfaces to brace.
IV. OPTIMIZATION
A. Introduction
In order to maintain a static posture, aircraft assembly
workers must compensate for their own weight and for the
forces originated operating tools or moving parts. These
actions generate an equivalent force and torque vector F
ext
at the hip, which must be borne by the legs of the worker
generating an equal and opposite vector F
ext
.
When the SRL is used, F
ext
can be provided in part or
entirely by the robot, relieving the human:
F
ext
=F
H
+F
R
(10)
whereF
R
andF
H
are the hip forces and torques generated
respectively by the robot and the human. The joint torques
required to originate these hip forces can be calculated using
the Jacobian matrices of the robot and of the human leg (J
R
and J
H
), considered as two link manipulators ﬁxed to the
ground at their contact points.
The total force to be generated at the hip can thus be
written as

(11)
Both 
R
and 
H
are vectors with three elements, cor-
responding to the torques of the robot and human joints.
Since the rank of M is at most 3, its null space has at least
dimension 3. This means that there are inﬁnite couples of

R
and 
H
that originate the same F
ext
. In other words, the
human leg and the SRL arm form with the ground a closed
kinematic chain that has inﬁnite static solutions for the joint
torques.
The objective of the SRL arm is to minimize the human
workload. Among the inﬁnite possible 
R
given a particular
system conﬁguration, we thus want to determine the value
that minimizes 
H
. The vector of the human joint torques
can be written as

and the second term represents the torques that the action of
the SRL subtracts from the human workload.

The analytical expression of

H
can be done by ﬁnding the point where the derivative
of k
H
k
2
is zero. The complete derivation is detailed in
Appendix B.
However, this solution does not take into account the limits
to the torques of the robotic arm. There might be situations
in which the joint torques required to originate F
ext
and
minimize the human workload (k
H
k
2
= 0) exceed the
maximum torques that can be provided by the SRL actuators.
Moreover, the limits of the different actuators are different
(See Appendix C for the characteristics of the SRL actuators
and the model parameters). In particular, the robot wrist joint
is the weakest both because its actuator is the smallest and
because its gripper must guarantee the no-slip condition at
the base of the bracing model. In order to include these limits
in the solution, we solve constrained optimization problems
employing the method of the Lagrange Multipliers.
The analysis so far has been general, and holds for the gen-
eral 3D problem. We will now present the analytical solution
to the optimization process in the 2D case. We consider the
projection of the man-machine system on the sagittal plane
(plane xz, see Figure 3). Although the movements of the
human and the robot are three dimensional, a planar model
can adequately represent both the kinematic conﬁguration
necessary to reach a crouched position and the major joint
torques required to bear gravitational loads.
The iterative procedure to ﬁnd
R
which minimizesk
H
k
2
and respects the SRL torque limits is as follows. The human
and robot conﬁguration (J
H
and J
R
) are given. We start
computing the solution 

R
which makesk
H
k

zero (the
global minimum). This solution is acceptable provided that
it respects all the torque limits. If this is not true, three cases
may happen.
First, one element of

R
exceeds its maximum value torque

iR;max
. In this case we apply the Lagrange Multipliers
to minimize k
H
k

with the the constraint that

, resulting in the Lagrangian:
L =k

This optimization yields a new value of

R
, with 
iR
saturated to its maximum value (for the analytical expression
of the solution, see Appendix D).
Second, if two elements of 

R
exceed their maximum
values
iR;max
and
jR;max
, we apply the Lagrange Multipli-
ers to minimizek

resulting in the Lagrangian:

expression of the solution, see Appendix D).
Third, if all three elements of

V. DISCUSSION
A. Comparison
In order to compare the performance of the SRL in
reducing the human workload with that of a traditional
exoskeleton, three scenarios will be analyzed. First, we
consider the case of a worker without any robotic aid. We
calculate the torques that the human joints must exert in order
to compensate for the weight of the user.
Second, we consider the case of a worker wearing a
traditional exoskeleton. In this scenario, the man-machine
system must generate joint torques that compensate for the
weight of both the human and the robot. The exoskeleton
torques will be subtracted from the required total ankle, knee
and hip torques. The goal is to minimize the absolute value of
the residual torques, which must be originated by the human
joints. In order to have a fair comparison, the weight and
maximum torques of the exoskeleton are chosen to be the
same as the ones of the SRL.
Third, we consider the case in which the worker is wearing
the SRL, which employs the bracing strategy in order to
minimize the workload of the user. We select for the robotic
arm the optimal conﬁguration that has been found in the
previous section (conﬁguration colored in magenta in Figure
5). In all of the three cases the position of the human is the
same (joint angles equal to those considered in Section IV).
This uniquely deﬁnes also the position of the exoskeleton,
whose kinematics are the same as those of the wearers leg.
The SRL, conversely, is free to select the optimal bracing
conﬁguration. The results in terms of human workload are
reported in Table I.
The computed human torques indicate that, although wear-
ing an exoskeleton is more advantageous than not using any
robotic aid, the SRL provides the best performance in terms
of human workload minimization. The intuitive explanation
of the advantage of the SRL in bearing the load is that, by
choosing a conﬁguration close to the singular one, the robotic
arm can support the wearer without resorting to large joint
torques. The load is simply discharged to the ground through
the robotic structure. In the vicinity of the singularity the

SRL exploits a large mechanical advantage in order to bear
loads with the least effort.
The power consumption of the SRL prototype arm while
bearing a vertical load has been measured in several con-
ﬁgurations. The considered robot positions and the results
in terms of required power are shown in Figure 6. These
experimental results conﬁrm that bearing a load in the
vicinity of a singular conﬁguration requires the least amount
of joint torques and therefore of power.
B. Bracing With Two Robotic Arms
Until this point, we have applied the bracing strategy to
a single SRL arm. If the user is executing a task, in fact,
the help of the other SRL arm might be needed in order
to get aircraft parts or to handle heavy tools. When the
task does not require speciﬁc robotic help, however, both
SRL arms can be used to brace the user and minimize the
human body workload. In this case the SRL can always
compensate the full body weight with optimal efﬁciency.
By assuming a triangular conﬁguration (Figure 7), the SRL
can keep both robotic arms in a singular conﬁguration and
compensate all the gravitational forces with minimal joint
torques (the residual moment arms at the wrist and at the
shoulder are very small by design). The only limiting factor
is the strength of the end effector electromagnets, whose
size can be tailored to the load to be borne. This triangular
bracing strategy is efﬁcient for any COM height h (Figure
7), therefore conﬁrming the advantage of the SRL over
traditional exoskeletons.
VI. CONCLUSIONS
This paper presented a novel strategy for the use of
the Supernumerary Robotic Limbs (SRL), a wearable robot
designed to assist human wearers by augmenting their bodies
with two additional robotic arms. Our vision for the SRL
is to become a functional extension of the wearers body,
coordinating with the user to execute complex operations
and providing support during the most physically demanding
tasks. In this study, we focus on the use of the SRL to
minimize the torques required to the human joints while
maintaining an uncomfortable posture or bearing a static
load.
We developed the bracing strategy, which consist of the
SRL making contact with the environment in order to support
the user. By grasping the environment, the robot is able to re-
duce the static loads borne by the wearer. As a consequence,
the torques required to the human joints can be minimized.
We presented a method to identify the optimal SRL bracing
conﬁguration, which allows to minimize human effort while
taking in account the robot torque limits and the available
contact points with the environment.
Finally, we showed that the SRL can minimize user
workload with a limited power consumption. This can be
achieved because the kinematic independence of the SRL
allows it to choose the optimal available bracing point. A
traditional exoskeleton, on the other hand, is constrained to
follow the movements of the human leg and thus cannot

of the SRL arm while bearing vertical loads. We compare three different
conﬁgurations in terms of power required to bear one Newton of vertical
load. In case A) the required power was 0:04 [W=N], in case B) it was
0:53[W=N] and in case C) it was 0:77[W=N].

torques and risk of saturation. We conclude that the SRL has
the potential to provide optimal support to the human user
in an efﬁcient way.
