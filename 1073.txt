Abstract—Multi-Material Rapid Prototyping (MM-RP) is a
promising fabrication process for compliant mechanisms, for
instance when compactness is a concern. The Pseudo-Rigid
Body Model (PRBM) approach is well-known for the synthesis
of compliant mechanisms. It is usually based on the use of
compliant joints to provide the mechanism mobilities. In this
paper, we propose the HSC joint as a new type of revolute
compliant joint that is well adapted to MM-RP, and that offers
interesting properties in terms of stiffness and range of motion.
Based on the HSC joint, a new compliant mechanism, suitable
for interventional MRI, is introduced with assessment of a ﬁrst
prototype that is entirely made out of a single polymer part.
The interest is twofold. First, the device constitutes a promising
solution in this medical context. Second, the impact of the use
of MM-RP in combination with PRBM can be evaluated, and
their use is discussed as a conclusion.
I. INTRODUCTION
A. Multi-material rapid prototyping for new robotic archi-
tectures
In several contexts, the design of robotic systems still
represents a challenge in terms of compactness, accuracy,
or speciﬁc requirements such as compatibility with imaging
devices in a medical environment. MRI scanners are for in-
stance very interesting devices for performing image-guided
procedures because of the absence of ionizing radiation and
the high level of contrast of soft tissues. So-called inter-
ventional MRI (iMRI) is however a challenging technique
because of the lack of space and the complexity of the
medical task. It can therefore beneﬁt from the introduction
of robotics. Several robotic devices have been proposed for
thesekindsofprocedures[1]–[4].Thesedeviceshaveseveral
degrees of freedom in order to control and insert a needle.
Because of the strong magnetic ﬁeld and the sensitivity of
the scanner to any active element, the design of a robotic
systemisdifﬁcult,andtheproposedsolutionssometimeslack
compactness.
One way to improve this situation is to consider remote
actuation, as considered in [5]–[7]. The structure of the
roboticdeviceshasalsotobepreferablymadeoutofpolymer
materials, so that MRI compatibility is ensured [8]. In the
iMRI context, the system accuracy is also required. Compli-
ant systems are thereforewell-adaptedto eliminate backlash,
end-effectordisplacementsbeingobtainedthanksto theelas-
ticity of the part materials. Conventional manufacturing of
polymer materials with machining or injection molding may
however not be usable for the complex geometries required
by a compliant mechanism. We therefore consider Rapid
Prototyping(RP)techniquesasofparticularinterest.Inorder
toobtainmobilitiesoflargeamplitudes,MultiMaterialRapid
Prototyping (MM-RP) can be employed, especially as it is
now commercially available in the case of the Polyjet 3D
system [9], [10]. An interesting combination of accuracy,
homogeneity of the part, mechanical properties and multi-
material production capability is then obtained.
B. Rapid prototyping in the design of robotic systems
RP techniques allows the designer to obtain three-
dimensional parts with almost arbitrary shapes [10]. These
additive manufacturing processes overcome complex manu-
facturingsequencesontheshopﬂoor[11].Asaconsequence,
theimpactofsuchprocessesonthedesignofroboticsystems
has been investigated. First, non-assembled robotic joints
have been designed [12]. Compliant joints have also been
manufactured [13], [14], but for small displacements only.
Shape Deposition Manufacturing (SDM, [15]) has opened
the way to produce multi-material parts using RP. Initially
considered for metals, SDM can be considered to produce
parts made out of different polymer materials [11] that also
embed active elements. Clark et al. [16] embed wires and
servos inside the structure of a biomimetic robot using SDM
and manufacture its legs with a multi-material compliant
structure. In terms of the design process, a biomimetic
approach leads to the selection of the robot architecture, as
well as the deﬁnition of the leg structures.
In the synthesis of compliant mechanisms, an efﬁcient
and widely-used method is the Pseudo-Rigid-Body Model
approach (PRBM [17], [18]). Its principle is to consider the
mechanismsynthesiswith a rigid-bodymechanism,and then
replace conventional joints by compliant joints. The mecha-
nism can then be analyzed with the usual tools for rigid-
body models. This method has been successfully applied
in the design of compliant mechanisms [17], using ﬂexural
elements as compliant joints. It seems of interest to use such
a design process for mechanisms obtained with MM-RP, but
compliant joints taking advantage of MM-RP have ﬁrst to
be built.
Inthispaper,anewcompliantmulti-materialjointisthere-
fore proposed in a ﬁrst step. Large rotations for this revolute
joint can be obtained thanks to MM-RP with interesting
stiffness properties. The synthesis of a mechanism using a
PRBM approach is conducted in a second step. The design

RP and PRBM in the design process can be discussed and
opens new perspectives, as outlined in the conclusion.
II. DESIGN OF A COMPLIANT MULTI-MATERIAL
REVOLUTE JOINT
A. Objectives of the design
We consider in a ﬁrst step the design of a revolute joint,
largely used in compliant mechanisms, obtained with MM-
RP. Following classical notations [18], [19], the axis of the
revolute joint is deﬁned as the Z axis. The desired behavior
of a compliant revolute joint can be expressed using a
compliance matrix C. It relates a set of forces and moments
F applied at the center of the joint O, to a the set of
translational and rotational displacements x, such as:
x =C.F (1)
withC a 6?6 matrix,which ﬁrst three diagonalcomponents
relate forces and translations, and the last three diagonal
components relate moments and rotations.
For a perfect compliant revolute joint,C is diagonal, such
that C = diag(c
i
), i ? [1,6] and c
6
is the only non-zero
valuefor a Z-axisjoint. The valueof this coefﬁcientdepends
ontheapplication.Thedesignobjectivesarethereforehereto
obtain a revolute joint that exhibits no extra-diagonal terms,
i.e.nocross-coupling,andlowratiosbetweenthecoefﬁcients
c
i
, i? [1,5], and c
6
.
Usually, the design of a compliant joint is performed as-
suming small strains in the material. When a single material
is used in a compliant joint, all the coefﬁcients of C are
linearlydependentontheYoung’smodulusE ofthematerial.
To create relative variations between the values of C, it
is necessary to modify the shape of the joint. Using MM-
RP, the shape and the distribution of the different materials
in the joint can affect the values of the compliant matrix.
It is therefore required to ﬁrst characterize the mechanical
properties of these materials.
B. Material characterization
In order to simplify the design issue, a combination of
only two materials is considered. More precisely, among the
materials that are compatible with the Polyjet technology,
the materials with the highest (Material A, VeroWhitePlus
RGD835) and the lowest (Material B, TangoBlackPlus
FLX980) Young’s modulus are chosen.
Experiments show that the material A exhibits a be-
havior in tension close to thermoplastics, with a Young’s
modulus E = 1890 MPa. Using norm ISO 37/7743, ten-
sion/compression tests were also performed for material B,
and the results are presented in Fig. 1. In tension, the
behavior is slightly non-linear due to the hyper-elasticity
of the material. It presents a maximal stress of 0.72 MPa.
The compression curve presents an exponential form, with a
maximum stress of 7.6 MPa without any breakage. Indeed,
the material has a Poisson’s coefﬁcient close to 0.5, which

means it is incompressible. The material can be designated
as a ”rubber-like” material and presents a maximum strain
of 70%. The compliant joint introduced in the next section
is developed to take advantage of this incompressibility.
C. The Helical Shape Compliant (HSC) joint
1) Design principle: Compliant joints are usually de-
signed by extruding a ﬂexure element. Using the rubber-like
material with such joints, for instance with a circular or a
corner-ﬁlleted ﬂexural hinge, the compliance c
6
would be
high, as would be the complianceson the other axes. Instead
of simply extruding a compliant proﬁle in a straight way, an
helicalsweeparound360
?
ofaﬂexuralelementisperformed
along a constant pitch p (see Fig. 2).
The compliant proﬁle is normal to the Z axis, but its local
orientation is spinning constantly. For any force application
in the X or Y direction, there is a section along the axis
that is submitted to compression. The joint stiffness is thus
improved in the directions perpendicular to the joint axis.
At the same time, the stiffness along the joint axis will be
similar to the one obtained with an extruded proﬁle.
With this helical sweep, the joint behaviorbecomesequiv-
alent in the X and Y directions. In other words, we should

. As shown in Fig. 3(a), a joint is
obtained by combining in parallel two sweeps with opposite
pitches. Thus, the coupling between rotation and translation
in the Z direction that is inherent to the helical shape is
overcome (Fig. 3 (a)).
The geometry of the proﬁle is adapted from a Corner-
Filleted Flexure Hinge proﬁle [19]. It is parametrized in
Fig. 2. The joint geometry is also interesting because joint
limits can be integrated:the maximumamplitudeof the joint
is deﬁned by the values of a and b. The outside diameter
of the joint is D =

rubber-like material is d =

. It can be
noted that several patterns can be repeated along the joint
axis (Fig. 3(b)).
2) Estimation of the compliance matrix by simulation:
In order to assess the behavior of the HSC joint, we have
selected a speciﬁc geometry. It takes into account the min-
imum feasible thickness of our MM-RP technology, about
1 mm, and a large amplitude of±45
?
. The values of the set
of parameters are presented in table I, and a model of the
joint is presented in Fig. 3 (b). The behavior of the rubber-
like material has been identiﬁed to a Yeoh model, using the
results of the experiments presented in Fig. 1.
UsingtheCADmodelofthejoint,aﬁniteelementanalysis
(PTC Creo-Mechanica R ) has been implemented. The six
components of the load F have been applied separately and
the displacement vector x is estimated for each load case.
Small loads are applied in order to obtain small stresses.
The effect of compression of the ”rubber-like” material is
minimized and the worst possible values of the compliances
c
i
are obtained.
Numerically,for a force of 2 N and a moment of 1 mm.N,
the diagonal matrix C

D. Experimental tests of the joint
In order to verify the previous results, joints with a geom-
etry deﬁned by the parameters in Table I are experimentally
tested using a tension tester (Zwicker/Roell, model Z005).
Three conﬁgurations are considered to sequentially apply a
force in the X, Y and Z directions (directions in Fig. 2),
and measure at the same time the relative displacement
between the two joint ends in the same direction. Different
shapes of specimens have been designed to be mountable
on the tension tester. From the experimental data, values of
c
1
, c
2
and c
3
can be estimated. In each situation, tension
and compression of the joints are achieved. The results are
presented in Fig. 4.
The curves have similar shapes, except the two obtained
in the Z direction. They are almost linear at the beginning,
with a slope lower than the other graphs and a transition
is happening because of the contact of the two helices. In
the X and Y directions, results in tension and compression
are comparable for small loads. This conﬁrms the equivalent
behavior of the joint in the X and Y directions. For large
loads, discrepancies can be observed between the results of
the X and Y axis. Experiments show that it is only related
to the shape differences of the specimens. A comparison
between simulation (black curve) and experiment (blue and
cyan curve) in the Y direction shows a good correlation,
with only a 10% difference on the displacement for 30 N.
Moreover, these curves present an exponential shape, which
conﬁrms the inﬂuence of the ”rubber-like” material incom-
pressibility.
The HSC joint exhibits interesting properties. Large rota-
tion is achievable, with interesting stiffnesses in the plane
perpendicular to the rotational axis due to the incompress-
ibilityofthe”rubber-like”material.Moreover,a symmetrical
mechanical behavior is shown in this plane, because of
the helical shape. Only the stiffness in the Z direction
would need to be further improved. Meanwhile, the PRBM
approach is applied in the following, in the sense that we
willuserigidbodymodelduringthesynthesisofacompliant
mechanism. However, due to the non-negligible compliance
in several directions, the whole matrix is used to represent
the force/deﬂection characteristics of the joint.

assistant for iMRI, in order to evaluate the efﬁciency of the
new design process.

A. Design requirements
During percutaneous procedures in iMRI, correctly ori-
entating the needle with respect to the patient is a difﬁcult
task.Theobjectiveisthereforetodesignaroboticassistantto
automatically orientate a needle around its point of insertion
on the skin, using MR images. As mentioned earlier, remote
actuation with cables is considered. A body-mounteddevice
is considered for the compactness it can offer, similarly to
passive devices that are commercially available [20]. The
device is intended to be used in two steps. First, the device
positions the needle axis, in the absence of the needle.
Second,the device position is maintainedwhile the needle is
manuallyinserted,the patient beingtranslated to have access
to the area of interest.
The device workspace can be deﬁned as a 90
?
cone of
which the apex is at the location of the incision point, and
the axis is perpendicular to the skin surface (designated as
the Y axis in the following). For safety reasons, it must be
possible to separate the device from the needle at any time.
B. Mechanism selection
The mechanism synthesis with a PRBM approach is
performed by ﬁrst selecting the best architecture for the
task. In our context, removing any physical joint from
the incision location largely simpliﬁes the cleaning of the
tissues. Remote center-of-motion (RCM) architectures are
therefore considered. In the same way, actuation with cables
is simpliﬁed if the active joints are linked to the base of the
device. As a result, we consider parallel RCM architectures.
Spherical mechanisms with RCM can be designed using
revolute joints which have axes that intersect at the RCM
location [21]–[23]. For large orientations, it is however
difﬁcult to avoid interferences between the legs of the
mechanism. Several conﬁgurations of parallelogram-based

linkageshave been presented to obtain RCM mechanisms.A
list is introduced in [24], and several RCM robotic systems
are based on their serial [25] or parallel [26] arrangement.
A parallelogram-based architecture is chosen here, derived
from the PantoScope [26]. The PantoScope is interesting
because large workspaces can be obtained in the absence
of singularities. The architecture we propose is based on the
interconnection of two parallelogram-based linkages repre-
sented in Fig. 5 using a cylindrical joint (Fig. 6).
The needle is inserted through the cylindrical joint. This
joint is necessary to obtain the two required DOF, and it is
possible to design it as dismountable so that the device can
be separated from the needle.
Eventually, each of the two linkages is composed of a
revolute joint R
1
, a parallelogram system L
2
made of four
revolute joints, and another revolute joint R
3
in a serial
arrangement (Fig. 5). The axes of the ﬁrst revolute joints
of the two linkages are shifted from the base plane to take
into account the size of the joints and keep the RCM at the
location of the incision.
C. The dimensional synthesis
The dimensional synthesis of the mechanism can be per-
formedby ﬁrst consideringthe workspace requirements.The
computationof the Forward Kinematic Model (FKM) is ﬁrst
established for that purpose.

workspace requirements can be easily fulﬁlled by choosing
for the two active joints a joint range equal to±45

Since compactness is a strong requirement, the geometric
parameters are chosen by further considering the inﬂuence
of the size of the HSC joints in the design. The design of
the HSC joints has been deﬁned in the previoussection. The
geometrical parameters (a

to minimize the size of the device, while avoiding any
interferences for the prescribed workspace. For this purpose,
a parametric CAD model is used to check for interferences.

. With such parameters, the maximal achievable
angle between the needle and the Y axis, i.e. the needle
angulation, has been estimated. Along the boundary of the
workspace, this value is in average equal to 47.4
?
, which is
satisfactory.
D. Stiffness evaluation
A compliance matrix describing the HSC joint has been
numerically assessed. The stiffness of the mechanism can
therefore be evaluated during the design. The method de-
tailed in [27] is adopted, assuming that the material used for
the structure is rigid. A ﬁrst estimation can be performed by
consideringthejointsonthebaseasnon-actuated.LetCf be

The values of cf

and cf

are high compared to cf

, which
conﬁrms that the device exhibits 2 DOF in rotation, with
the absence of rotation along Y, the needle axis. When axial
forces are applied at the incision point, the stiffnesses in the
three directions are quite equivalent.
If the active joints are maintained in a static position
(?

E. Final design
The ﬁnal design is represented in Fig. 7. Revolute joints
are based on the HSC joint design. The cylindricaljoint uses
a plain bearing described as follows: the outer cylinder is
made out of PTFE and the inner tube obtained from RP.
With this design, the device can be produced in a single
step, directly from CAD.

IV. EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION
A. Prototype manufacturing
As mentioned earlier, the whole device is produced in a
single step. After cleaning, only the bearing and the wires
for control need to be added. A prototype is presented in
Fig. 8, shown in an actuated position.
B. Evaluation
The main requirements concern the amplitude of the
needle rotation, and the existence of a RCM around a point
that corresponds to the incision on the skin of a patient.
A vision-based evaluation of the end-effector displacements
is therefore performed. The principle of the evaluation is
outlinedinFig.9.Thecameraispositionedintwosuccessive

in Fig 9. Then the position
of the needle axis in the image plane is recorded for several
positions of the actuated joints. Two identical tests are
performed. For both tests, only one active joint is activated
while the other is blocked in its initial position, resulting
in two series of positions (in blue and in green in ﬁg. 9).
After image processing, the position and orientation of the

V. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper, the interest of combining MM-RP and
PRBM for the design of compliant mechanisms has been
investigated.
The design of the proposed HSC joint takes advantage of
MM-RP, in termsoffreedomof shapeand materialbehavior.
A large range of motion is obtained with interesting stiffness
properties. The synthesis of a new device for iMRI is then
performed following the PRBM approach. First results with
the prototype make the solution of interest in the medical
context, with a compact device that can be manufactured in
asinglestep.Fromthisexample,thecombinationofMM-RP
and PRBM in consequence appears as a promising solution
to design new compliant mechanisms.
Future work will now focus ﬁrst on the HSC joint prop-
erties, that need further optimization. This should indeed
be performed in a global optimization to reﬁne the joint
geometry and the mechanism geometry at the same time.
Such an optimization will need to take into account the
existing limits of the fabrication process, such as stair-steps
effects, that today affect the performances of the prototype.
Further work will also be accomplished in the integration of
functions around the joints in order to improve the device
performances. In particular, adding braking function at the
joint level would be of interest, in the medical context for
example.Compliantmechanismscouldthenbemaintainedin
a static position in the absence of power, which is desirable
for safety reasons.
