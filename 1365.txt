Abstract— In this paper, we proposed a control system with
learning to investigate neuromechanical functions for generat-
ing adaptive bipedal locomotion on a splitbelt treadmill. Hu-
mans show two types of adaptations, called early adaptation and
late adaptation, in splitbelt treadmill walking. In our previous
work, we investigated the locomotor behavior of a biped robot
driven by nonlinear oscillators with phase resetting and showed
that it produced the early adaptation like humans. However,
because the locomotion control system did not contain any
learning mechanism, it did not show the late adaptation. In this
paper, we newly develop learning systems, which modulate the
interlimb and intralimb coordination patterns, and incorporate
them to our locomotion control system. We investigated the
locomotor behavior of a biped robot using computer simulations
and robot experiments. The results showed the early and late
adaptations during the splitbelt treadmill walking and the time
evolution of locomotion parameters was similar to that of
humans, which might contribute to understanding of adaptive
mechanism in humans and to guiding principle for designing
a control system of biped robots.
I. INTRODUCTION
Humans and animals are capable of adaptive locomotor
behavior to various environments by controlling their legs
skillfully. Adaptive modulations in the movement of each
leg (intralimb coordination) and the relationship of the move-
ments between the left and right legs (interlimb coordination)
are crucial. To investigate the adaptation mechanism in the
intralimb and interlimb coordinations in locomotion, a split-
belt treadmill has been often used [4], [15], [18]. It has two
parallel belts and their speeds are controlled independently,
which artiﬁcially produces an asymmetric environment.
In human splitbelt treadmill walking, two types (different
time scales) of adaptations are observed (Fig. 1) [15]. One
is observed when the conﬁguration of the treadmill switches
from the tied conﬁguration (TC: same speed between the
belts) to the splitblelt conﬁguration (SC: different speeds
between the belts). At that time, locomotion parameters
related to the intralimb coordination, such as duty factors,
and locomotion parameters related to the interlimb coordi-
nation, such as double support duration and relative phase
between the leg motions, suddenly change. It is called early
adaptation (red arrow in Fig. 1). The other shows gradual
changes in locomotion parameters, such as double support
duration and relative phase between the leg motions, after the
early adaptation and is called late adaptation (green arrow in

human splitbelt treadmill walking (modiﬁed from [15])
Fig. 1). In addition, the late adaptation produces aftereffect
after the treadmill conﬁguration returns to the TC (blue arrow
in Fig. 1). From these results, the late adaptation seems
related to motion memory and learning. Although the late
adaptation clearly emerged through functions of the nervous
system, the underlying mechanism remains unclear.
Locomotion is generated through dynamic interactions be-
tween the nervous system, the body mechanical system, and
the environment. To elucidate the adaptation mechanisms in
locomotion, neuromechanical models have been developed.
Physiological studies have suggested that central pattern gen-
erator (CPG) in the spinal cord strongly contributes to rhyth-
mic movement, such as locomotion [13]. Many researches
have developed CPG-based nervous system models [8], [10],
[17]. As a modulation mechanism for the rhythm of the CPG,
physical modeling of phase resetting based on physiological
evidence [5], [6], [16] contributed to generating robust walk-
ing against force perturbations and environmental variations
[1], [3], [11], [12]. In our previous work [7], we developed
a biped robot and a locomotion control system based on the
CPG with phase resetting to investigate the neuromachanical
functions during a splitbelt treadmill walking. Although the
robot without phase resetting easily fell down, the robot
with phase resetting produced straight walking during the
SC. Instead, the relative phase between the leg motions and
duty factors changed autonomously. These changes emerged
through dynamic interactions between the locomotion control
system, the robot mechanical system, and the splitbelt tread-
mill. These changes had similar trend to the early adaptation
during human splitbelt treadmill walking. However, because
the control system did not contain any learning mechanism,
our robot did not show the late adaptation.
To explain the adaption mechanism including the late
adaptation, some models have been proposed. Otoda et al.
[14] used a biped robot in the sagittal plane and produced
adaptive locomotor behavior by modulating the feedback
gains of hip joints. In their system, they used the information
of one leg’s state only to modulate the gain of the leg and
did not use the information of the interlimb coordination. Ito
et al. [9] modeled adaptive locomotion of cats by using four

oscillators corresponding to the leg motions and a potential
function about the relative phases of the oscillators. They
modulated the relative phases based on the potential function
and showed the late adaptation in their model. However, their
model did not involve the body dynamics.
In this study, to overcome the limitation of our previous
model to investigate neuromechanical functions related to
the late adaptation, we newly introduce two types of learning
systems to our control system. One is to control the interlimb
coordination pattern directly using the relative phase between
the leg motions. The other is to control the foot-landing phase
of each leg depending on changes of the timing of foot
landing, which corresponds to modulation of the intralimb
coordination. We ﬁrst conduct computer simulations using a
robot model and then perform robot experiments to verify the
validity of simulation results in the real world. We show that
our robot shows early and late adaptations in the splitbelt
treadmill walking and the time evolution of locomotion
parameters is similar to that of humans.
II. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP
A. Biped robot
Figure 2 shows the biped robot used in this study. It
was developed in our previous work [7]. For the computer
simulation, we derived the equation of motion of the robot
model using Lagrangian equations as in [2] and solved the
equation using the fourth order Runge-Kutta method with a
step size of 0.1 ms. For the robot experiment, the robot gains
electric power supply externally. An external host computer
(Intel Pentium 4 2.8 GHz, RT-Linux) controls the robot and
sends the command signals at intervals of 1 ms.
B. Splitbelt treadmill
We used a splitbelt treadmill developed in our previous
work [7]. The width of each belt is 15 cm and the length
between the rotation axes is 64 cm. To simulate the walking
of the robot model on a splitbelt treadmill, we prepared two
ﬂoors for the left and right legs to contact and moved the
ﬂoors independently. We used a linear spring and damper
system for modeling the foot contact with the ﬂoor and
reaction forces.
By following [4], [15], we used two types of speed
conditions for the splitbelt treadmill: 1. TC with v

the locomotor behavior between these speed conditions as
in [7], ﬁrstly the robot walked on the TC. After the robot
established steady walking, we suddenly changed the speed
condition from TC to SC and the robot walked on the SC.
III. BASIC LOCOMOTION CONTROL SYSTEM
Before explaining the learning system proposed in this
study, we brieﬂy introduce the locomotion control system
used in our previous study (see [7] for the details). The
locomotion control system was constructed using nonlinear
oscillators based on the CPG and phase resetting, which
consists of trajectory generator (Section III-A) and rhythm
generator (Section III-B) (Fig. 3A).
A. Trajectory generator
For the locomotion system, we used two simple phase
oscillators (oscillators 1 and 2) and deﬁne ?
i
(i = 1,2) as
the phase of the oscillator i. The desired joint movements
are determined by these oscillator phases.
The desired leg motion consists of the swing and stance
phases (Fig. 3B). The swing phase draws a simple closed
curve (red line) that contains an anterior extreme position
(AEP) and a posterior extreme position (PEP). It starts from
the PEP and continues until the foot contacts the ﬂoor. The
stance phase draws straight line from the landing position
(LP) to the PEP (blue line). We used ?
i
= 0 at the PEP and
?
i
= ?
i
reset
at the AEP (the value of ?
i
reset
is determined in
Section IV-B). Distance between the AEP and PEP is given
by D. We deﬁned the gait cycle and duty factor as T and
?, respectively. The stride length S and locomotion speed
v during overground locomotion are respectively given by
S = D/? and v = D/?T . We used D = 2.5 cm, T =
0.70 s, and ? = 0.50, which results in S = 5.0 cm and v =
7.1 cm/s.
B. Rhythm generator
The rhythm generator produces the basic locomotion
rhythm using the oscillator phases. We used the following
phase dynamics:

where ? (= 2π/T) is the basic oscillator frequency that
uses the same value among the oscillators; g
i
1
and g
i
2
are
functions related to the interlimb coordination pattern and
phase resetting, respectively, given below.
1) Phase modulation based on interlimb coordination
pattern: The relative phase between the oscillators represents
the interlimb coordination pattern because each oscillator
phase governs the corresponding leg motion. To control the
interlimb coordination pattern, the function g
i
1
acts as the
interaction between the oscillators. We deﬁne the desired
relative phase between the oscillators by ∆. The function
g

is given by

Ksin(?

?∆) i = 1,2 (2)
whereK is a gain constant and we usedK = 1.0. The relative
phase approaches into the desired state by this function.
Because the adaptation of the interlimb coordination is
crucial for splitbelt treadmill walking, we modulated the
parameter ∆ through learning (see Section IV-A).
2) Phase modulation based on phase resetting: To gain
robust walking, we used the phase resetting mechanism.
When the foot of Leg i lands on the ﬂoor, phase ?
i
is reset
to ?
i
reset
. Therefore, the function g
i

is written by

where t

is the time when the foot of Leg i lands on the
ﬂoor and ?(·) denotes Dirac’s delta function. Because the
modulation of the oscillator phase by the phase resetting
is also crucial, we modulated the parameter ?
i
reset
through
learning (see Section IV-B).
IV. MODULATION OF CONTROL PARAMETERS THROUGH
LEARNING
Our robot produced stable, straight walking on the splitbelt
treadmill using the locomotion control system explained in
the previous section and its behavior showed similar trend
to the early adaptation of humans [7]. However, the control
system did not incorporate any learning mechanism so that
the robot did not show gradual modulation unlike the late
adaptation in humans. Therefore, in this paper we developed
new learning systems using two control parameters and
incorporated them into our control system.
A. Modulation of interlimb coordination pattern through
learning
The desired interlimb coordination pattern is represented
by ∆ in (2) and the relative phase (?
1
? ?
2
) is basically
designed to converge to the desired state in the oscillator
dynamics, which is because humans and animals have inher-
ent or empirical interlimb coordination pattern. Yanagihara
et al. [18] showed that cats walking on a splitbelt treadmill
obtained a new interlimb coordination pattern to adapt to
the splitbelt environment and kept the pattern even after the
experiment. The results suggest that the cats have desired in-
terlimb coordination pattern and modulate it through learning
in perturbed environment. The function g
i
1
is consistent with
these ﬁndings and we modulated the interlimb coordination
pattern through learning below.
For the desired relative phase between the oscillators, we
deﬁne a potential function V
n
at nth step inspired by the
idea of Ito et al. [9] by

where t
n

is the time when a foot lands on the ground at
nth step and ∆
n
indicates the value of ∆ at nth step. The
potential function evaluates the averaged difference between
the actual and desired relative phases in one gait cycle. It is
used to ﬁnd a suitable interlimb coordination pattern through
learning by minimizing the value of the potential function.
To reduce the potential function along its gradient direction,
the desired relative phase ∆
n
is modulated by
∆
n+1

??
∆

(5)
where ?
∆
is the learning rate. The value of the parameter ∆
is modulated by (5) at each foot contact. We used ?
∆
= 0.35
and set ∆ = π as the initial value.
B. Modulation of foot-landing phase through learning
As another way to produce adaptive interlimb coordination
pattern, we modulated the parameters related to the intralimb
coordination. That is, we regulate the individual leg motion
to induce the change in the interlimb coordination.
In our previous work [7], we used ?
i
reset
= 2π(1? ?).
This is because the nominal foot-landing position is set at
the AEP. However, the foot-landing phases depend on the
locomotion dynamics and the feet do not always land on the
ﬂoor at the AEP. Therefore, we deﬁne a potential functionU
i
n
at nth step based on the difference between actual landing
phase ?
i

and designed landing phase ?

by

where ?

and ?

are the values of ?
i

and ?
i

at
nth step, respectively. Based on the gradient direction of the
potential function U
i
n
, we regulate ?
i

as follows;
?
i

i

??
?
∂U

∂?

i = 1,2 (7)
where ?
?
is a learning rate. We used ?
?
= 0.25 and set
?
i
reset,0
= 2π(1? ?) as the initial value. This modulation
changes the swing phase duration because the increase of
?
i
reset
lengthens the duration to move the foot from the PEP
to AEP. By changing the swing phase duration, it modulates
the foot-landing phase.

and the phase at foot landing ?
i
land
, respectively. While the
relative phase remained almost antiphase in the TC, it sud-
denly shifted from antiphase when the conﬁguration of the
treadmill was changed. Although the phases at foot landing
?
1
land
and ?
2
land
have the same value during the TC, they also
shifted suddenly when the treadmill conﬁguration switched
to the SC. At the change of the treadmill conﬁguration, ?
1
land
increased while ?
2
land
decreased. It means that the timing of
the foot landing of Leg 1 was delayed while the timing of
the foot landing of Leg 2 became earlier. In this case, the
early adaptation occurred but the late adaptation did not.
To verify the simulation results in the real world, we
conducted robot experiments. Figures 4B and D show the
relative phase and foot-landing phases. During the TC, the
relative phase converged to almost 3.2 rad, which was
slightly different from π, and phases at foot landing are
different from each other. This might be caused by the
asymmetry in the robot. When the conﬁguration of the
treadmill switched into the SC, the relative phase shifted
downward from the value at the TC and?
1
land
increased while
?
2
land
decreased almost simultaneously. Both simulation and
experiment results have qualitatively similar trends and are
almost the same as in our previous work [7].
B. Simulation and experimental results with learning
Next, we investigated functional roles of the learning
systems (5) and (7). We used the same value for the control
parameters and the same condition for the splitbelt treadmill,
as in the previous section. In robot experiments, we started
to record the data after the relative phase and modulation
parameters (∆, ?
i
reset
) become the steady state during the
TC.
1) Modulation of interlimb coordination: We used only
the modulation (5). Figures 5A and C show the relative
phase and the potential function V
n
, respectively, in the
computer simulation. During the TC, the relative phase is
antiphase and the potential function remains almost zero.
At the early stage of the SC, the relative phase shifted
from antiphase. Although there is a difference between the
actual and desired relative phases at this stage, the desired
relative phase was modulated gradually through learning.
After sufﬁcient steps, the difference between them decreased
and they converged to the same value while reducing the
value of the potential function but getting away from π
(antiphase). The experimental results of the relative phase
and the value of potential function are shown in Figs. 5B
and D, which show similar trends to the simulation results. In
this case, the early and late adaptations are generated but the

direction of the change of the interlimb coordination pattern
during the late adaptation is different from that of humans.
2) Modulation of foot-landing phase: We used only the
modulation (7). Figures 6A, C, and E show the relative
phase, the landing phase, and the potential functions U
i
n
,
respectively, in the computer simulation. During the TC, the
relative phase shows almost the same result as above and the
values of the potential functions are almost zero. At the early
stage of the SC, the relative phase also shifted from antiphase
and foot-landing phase of Leg 1 increased while foot-landing
phase of Leg 2 decreased. However, after sufﬁcient steps, the
relative phase returned to antiphase and foot-landing phases
returned to π while reducing the values of the potential
functions. The experimental results of the relative phase,
the foot-landing phases, and the potential function U
i
n
are
shown in Figs. 6B, D, and F. These show similar trends
to the simulation results. In this case, the early and late
adaptations are also generated but the interlimb coordination
pattern entirely returned to antiphase after the late adaptation.
This trend is slightly different from that of humans.
3) Modulation of interlimb coordination and foot-landing
phase: We used the modulations of both the interlimb
coordination and foot-landing phase. Figures 7A, C, E, and
G show the relative phase, the potential functionV
n
, the foot-
landing phases, and the potential functions U
i
n
, respectively,
in the computer simulation. During the TC and at the early
stage of the SC, these data are almost the same as above.
After that, the desired relative phase gradually decreased
and approached to the actual one due to the modulation of
interlimb coordination. On the other hand, the actual relative
phase gradually increased to approach to the desired one due
to the modulation of intralimb coordination. After sufﬁcient
steps, the difference between the actual and desired relative
phases vanished while reducing the potential functions V
n
and U
i
n
. The experimental results are shown in Figs. 7B, D,
F, and H, which show similar trends to the simulation results.
In this case, the early and late adaptations are also generated
and the change of the interlimb coordination pattern during
the late adaptation shows similar trend to that of humans
(Fig. 1).
VI. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we investigated the adaptive locomotor
behavior of a biped robot on a splitbelt treadmill by using
computer simulations and robot experiments. We newly
incorporated learning systems of the relative phase between
the oscillators and foot-landing phases to our previous CPG-
based locomotion control system and showed gradual mod-
ulations like the late adaptation in human splitbelt treadmill
walking.
We proposed two types of learning systems; one is re-
lated to the interlimb coordination and the other is foot-
landing phase related to the intralimb coordination. When
we used only the modulation of the interlimb coordination,
the relative phase gets away from antiphase after the early
adaptation. It is opposite trend compared with the adaptation
of humans. When we used only the modulation of the
foot-landing phase, the relative phase entirely returned to
antiphase. This is also slightly different from the adaptation
in humans. However, by using both learning systems, the
result showed a similar trend to that of humans. This is
because the two modulations worked together in a way that
the modulation of the interlimb coordination pattern moved
the relative phase away from antiphase and the modulation
of the foot-landing phase attracted the relative phase towards
antiphase. As a result, the relative phase converged to some
intermediate value between the antiphase and the relative
phase just after the early adaptation. This result suggests that
both the modulations of the interlimb coordination pattern

Fig. 7. Result with modulation of interlimb coordination and foot-landing phase. Relative phase between the oscillators (A: Simulation, B: Experiment),
the potential function Vn (C: Simulation, D: Experiment), the foot-langing phases (E: Simulation, F: Experiment), and the potential function U

and individual control of each leg contribute to generating
adaptive behaviors in the late adaptation and are necessary
for adaptive locomotion. Our results might contribute to un-
derstanding of the adaptation mechanism in human splitbelt
treadmill walking and to guiding principle for designing a
control system of biped robots. In the future, we would like
to further improve our robot and control system to elucidate
human’s control mechanism of adaptive locomotor behavior.
