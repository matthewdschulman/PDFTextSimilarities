A computational tool to improve ﬂapping efﬁciency of robotic insects
Yufeng Chen, Alexis Lussier Desbiens, and Robert J Wood
Abstract— We implement a 2D computational model to inves-
tigate the unsteady aerodynamic effects not captured by classi-
cal quasi-steady models. We compare numerical simulation re-
sults, experimental measurements and quasi-steady predictions
to demonstrate the strength of the numerical tool in identifying
unsteady ﬂuid mechanisms and improving propulsive efﬁciency
of ﬂapping wing robots. In particular, this study quantiﬁes the
effect of the relative phase between wing degrees of freedom
 on lift and drag production. The computational model also
identiﬁes unsteady effects such as wake capture and downwash
that are not accounted for in classical quasi-steady models.
To examine the accuracy of our computational model, we
fabricate millimeter-scale wings through the SCM fabrication
processes and measure ﬂapping kinematics and dynamics.
The experiments show 2D computational model is 44% more
accurate than the quasi-steady model and can be further used to
improve wing morphology for better aerodynamic performance.
I. INTRODUCTION
In recent years a number of ﬂapping-wing micro-air-
vehicles have achieved stable hovering ﬂight [1], [2], [3].
Compared to traditional ﬁxed wing or helicopter ﬂight, ﬂap-
ping wing ﬂight observed in nature relies on unsteady ﬂuid
dynamics principles to achieve better maneuverability and
smaller vehicle size [4]. Such advantages make ﬂapping wing
air vehicles excellent candidates for surveillance and remote
sensing in hazardous locations. Meanwhile, the unsteady
nature of ﬂapping ﬂight poses modeling and control chal-
lenges to improve stability, maneuverability, and propulsive
efﬁciency.
The current Harvard RoboBee design, shown in Figure
1, uses two bimorph piezoelectric actuators to indepen-
dently control wing stroke motion, and the hinge motion
is mediated by passively rotating Kapton hinges. While this
design reduces system complexity, power consumption and
vehicle mass, it poses challenges to developing a dynamical
model that predicts both wing hinge kinematics and thrust
generation.
A number of quasi-steady models have been developed
from steady state classical aerodynamics [5] to describe
ﬂapping ﬂight. In 1963, V on Karman et al. ﬁrst proposed
a formula for lift and drag coefﬁcients based on complete
separated ﬂow computation. In 2002, Dickinson et al. [6]
observed unsteady phenomena such as rotational circulation

and delayed stall using a robotic wing. He proposed a quasi-
steady model based on his experimental results and intro-
duced additional modeling terms that account for added mass
and rotational damping effects. Lussier Desbiens et al. [7]
adopted the quasi-steady model for a passive ﬂapping system
and demonstrated that the quasi-steady model yields accurate
kinematic and thrust predictions in the time averaged sense.
However, quasi-steady models cannot yield accurate predic-
tions of time varying lift and drag, and this error in turn
affects prediction of aerodynamic torques that govern hinge
kinematics. This modeling insufﬁciency restricts all control
algorithms to rely on time-averaged predictions, which ad-
versely affects maneuverability and ﬂapping efﬁciency.
A number of 2D [8] or 3D [9] numerical models have been
developed to bridge the discrepancy between experiments
and quasi-steady models. Lentink et al. [10] show that 3D
mechanisms such as spanwise ﬂow stabilize the leading
edge vortex and delay detachment. In hovering ﬂight, vortex
shedding only happens at stroke reversal and as a result 2D
and 3D computational models yield very similar predictions.
In this paper, we implement a numerical two dimensional
Navier Stokes equation solver to study effects of parameters
that are not treated by quasi-steady models. In particular, we
investigate the effect of relative phase between stroke and
hinge rotation angles (Figure 2) on lift and drag production.
As shown in Dickinson’s robotic wing experiments [6], mod-
erate differences in accounts for more than 30% difference
in measured lift. Current wing and hinge designs rely on
quasi-steady models to optimize kinematic parameters such
as stroke and hinge amplitude, but ignore the inﬂuence of

Intervals of large stroke angle () represent pitch rotation, and intervals
of slowly changing hinge angle ( ) represents wing translation. The wing
translational phase is further divided into stroke acceleration and stroke
deceleration phase based on the curvature of the stroke function. The motion
tracking method is described in Section IIIB.
: We study this parameter’s inﬂuence on lift and drag
production by running simulations and experiments, thereby
extracting useful physical principles that will improve future
wing and hinge designs. The simulated results using our CFD
solver are compared with experimental results to validate our
ﬁndings. This computational model is shown to be 44% more
accurate than traditional quasi-steady models.
In addition, our simulation shows several interesting un-
steady phenomena such as vortex shedding, downwash and
wake capture. These physical phenomena affect lift and drag
production but are not accounted for in quasi-steady models.
By choosing appropriate morphological parameters, we can
increase lift production by making effective use of the wake
capture process. Hence, unlike quasi-steady models that only
yield force predictions, our numerical model allows us to
improve wing morphology and motion by making effective
use of unsteady phenomena. Owing to this increased ac-
curacy, this numerical tool is more powerful for improving
ﬂapping efﬁciency than its quasi-steady counterparts. In the
rest of this paper we explain the implementation of the
numerical model, describe the experiment procedure, and
compare simulation with experimental results.
II. COMPUTATIONAL METHOD
A. Flapping Kinematics
As shown in Figure 3, the kinematics of a ﬂapping wing
has 2 degrees of freedom—stroke and hinge rotations. The
experimental set up allows us to control the frequency and
amplitude of stroke motion, while the hinge rotation is
passively controlled by aerodynamic and inertial torques
and hinge compliance. As shown in Figure 2, experimental
measurement shows the hinge motion is very close to be a

Fig. 3. The RoboBee wing has 2 degrees of freedom. The rotation ()
around the vertical body axis is actively controlled by piezoelectric actuators,
and the rotation ( ) around wing hinge line is passive. In blade element
method, the motion of a thin rectangular segment along the wing chord
(shown in blue) is projected onto a 2D plane. The leading edge of the
wing segment is marked green. The angular stroke motion is transformed
into planar oscillatory motion, in which the amplitude L is given by
L = maxr, and r is half the wing radius. The black arrows indicate
the instantaneous direction and relative amplitude of aerodynamic forces.

tools.
B. Numerical solver implementation
Our computational model assumes a 2D thin ﬂat plate of
dimension 20m 3mm ﬂapping in air with kinematics
described in the previous section. The two dimensional in-
compressible Navier Stokes equation and the corresponding
boundary conditions that govern the ﬂapping motion are :

where  u = (u;v) is the ﬂuid velocity ﬁeld and p is the
pressure ﬁeld that enforces the incompressibility condition.
The ﬂuid speed along the wing surface is equal to the wing
velocity, and the pressure at far ﬁeld is set to be 0. In our
1734
computations, the range of Reynolds number is betweem 300
to 600:
We implement a numerical solver using the nodal dis-
continuous Galerkin ﬁnite element method, which allows
more geometric ﬂexibility than the ﬁnite difference method
and requires coarser mesh resolution than the continuous
Galerkin method. The solver is implemented on a moving
Cartesian coordinate system, and the computational Delau-
nay triangulation mesh is generated by the open source
package distmesh [13]. The circular mesh used for simulation
contains 2242 elements, and its radius is chosen to be six
times the wing chord length to avoid unintended boundary
effects. The solution inside each mesh element is interpolated
using 5
th
order Lagrange polynomials.
The structure of this solver is based on the method
developed in [11]. The temporal scheme is solved using the
second order backward Adams Bashforth method, and the
spatial scheme is separated into three steps that individually
treat nonlinear advection, pressure ﬁeld contribution, and
viscous correction. In addition, the ﬂapping motion requires
the computational mesh to move with respect to the inertial
reference frame, hence a change of coordinate system is
needed. This method is not identical to solving the Navier
Stokes equation in a non-inertial reference frame by adding
ﬁctitious forces; it is more general because it also allows
geometric deformation of the mesh. The transformation
between physical coordinates that are ﬁxed in space and
computational coordinates that move with the wing is deﬁned
as:
u(x;y;t) = ~ u(;;)
v(x;y;t) = ~ v(;;)
p(x;y;t) = ~ p(;;)

III. EXPERIMENT SETUP
To compare the numerical model with the actual forces
generated by the RoboBee, we utilize an existing set up to
measure the kinematics and dynamics of a ﬂapping wing
[7]. As shown in Figure 4, the wing is attached to a custom
made carbon ﬁber wing driver that is mounted on a dual
axis force sensor. The wing stroke motion is controlled by
a bimorph piezoelectric actuator, and the hinge motion is
passively mediated by a Kapton hinge. The optical sensor
records the motion of the piezoelectric actuator, and the
camera records the top view of the ﬂapping motion. The
following sections describe the details of force measurement,
motion measurement, and wing fabrication processes.

Fig. 4. This illustration shows the experimental setup. The carbon ﬁber
wing driver consists of a piezoelectric actuator (black), transmission and
structural support. An external electric signal controls the actuator to drive
the stroke motion of the millimeter-scale wing (red). The aerodynamic
and inertial forces generated by a ﬂapping wing are transformed into
displacements of the Invar sensor. Two capacitive sensors measure the
displacement and the data is post-processed to obtain lift and drag. A high
speed camera records the stroke motion.
A. Force measurement
The custom sensor consists of four parallel dual cantilever
modules arranged in a series-parallel conﬁguration. The
structure converts a load into displacements in the vertical
and horizontal directions, and the displacements in both
directions are measured by two PISeca D-510.021 capacitive
sensors. We calibrate the sensors by hanging weights, and
the sensitivity was found to be -84.6 and 85.5 V/mN for
the lift and drag axes respectively. In our experiment, the
driving frequency is chosen to be 120Hz so that lift force
has a fundamental frequency of 240Hz and drag force has a
fundamental frequency of 120Hz: Since the sensors measure
aerodynamic and the inertial forces from the wing and wing
driver, we only report time averaged drag measurements. On
the other hand, we can accurately measure lift by ﬁltering
out 10Hz to 200Hz and > 500Hz harmonics to eliminate
actuator inertial contributions and system resonance.This
band pass ﬁlter may eliminate higher order harmonics of
the actual lift signal, hence for comparison purposes we
also apply the same ﬁlter to the numerically computed lift.
The wing used in our experiment weigh 0:52mg , and the
magnitude of wing inertial contribution often accounts for
15% 20% of the aerodynamic contribution. Using measured
ﬂapping kinematics and the estimated mass properties from
SolidWorks, we can substract out the effect of wing inertial
contribution. In the lift axis, the formula is given by

offset due to wing thickness.
B. Wing kinematics measurement
The wing stroke and hinge motion are recorded at 10kHz
using a Phantom V7.3 high speed video camera with an AF
MICRO Nikon 200mm f/4 lens. In this experiment, we treat
the wing as a ﬂat plate and use the top view to extract hinge
and stroke motions. The details of the extraction algorithm
are described in [7].
C. Wing and wing hinge design
The wing used in the experiment is made from a carbon
ﬁber frame and polyester membrane with 3mm mean chord
and 54mm
2
total area. The wing hinge is made of a com-
pliant 1.25mm 140m 7m kapton layer sandwiched
between two carbon ﬁber layers. Details of the design and
manufacturing methodology used for the wing, transmission,
and actuators are described in [14].
IV. DISCUSSION
To examine the validity of our numerical model, we
compare simulation results with the measurements. A wing
is ﬂapped with speciﬁed driving voltage and frequency pairs
and we measure the corresponding kinematics and forces.
The measured wing kinematics are used as the inputs to
the numerical simulation, and lift and drag coefﬁcients are
computed to compare with experimental results. The numer-
ical simulator is also used to explore parameter spaces that
are not covered by passive rotation experiments to further
study the inﬂuence of relative phase parameter and identify
phenomena not accounted for in quasi-steady models.
A. Comparison between experiment and computation
We run the ﬂapping experiment with a 120Hz driving
frequency and sweep through different voltage amplitudes to
ﬁnd a case for which the relative phase between stroke and
hinge angle is 0

. The kinematics and forces are measured
using the method described in the previous section. At 190V ,
 is measured to be -0:19

and the ﬂapping stroke and
1736
hinge amplitudes are measured to be 34

and 43

respectively. The corresponding Reynolds number is

We then use 

, and  = 0

as
the input parameters and solve the 2D ﬂow problem for the
chord segment at midspan of the wing. Finally, we compute
the instantaneous lift and drag coefﬁcients and compare
that with classical quasi-steady model and experimental
measurements.
As shown in the top graph of Figure 5, the numerical
solution (blue) shows lift peaks in the stroke deceleration
phase and this agrees well with the measurement (red). On
the other hand, the green curve (quasi-steady model) is sym-
metric with respect to its local maxima so the quasi-steady
model does not distinguish between the stroke acceleration
phase and the stroke deceleration phase. While there are
quasi-steady models based on 2D inviscid ﬂow that address
added mass and rotational circulation effects, they usually
involve extra ﬁtting parameters and are not robust for large
operating range. Hence, the quasi-steady model we compare
with only contains the translational term. This asymmetry
can be understood by studying the ﬂow structures around
the wing and can be utilized to enhance lift production.
Figure 6 shows the vorticity ﬁeld around a ﬂapping wing
segment in the fourth ﬂapping period. Large vorticity on the
wing leading edge corresponds to high lift. In the stroke
acceleration phase (T=3.08 to T=3.25 and T=3.58 to T=3.75),
vorticity on the upper wing surface is small. In the stroke
deceleration phase (T=3.25 to T=3.42 and T=3.75 to T=3.91)
we observe a large vortex on the upper wing surface that
leads to large lift force. We also observe that the leading edge
vortex grows only when the angle of attack is positive. On
the other hand, the vortex shedding process is not sensitive
to angle of attack.
This observation suggests that by varying the relative
phase  between stroke and hinge angles we can increase
or reduce lift.< 0

corresponds to advanced wing pitch so
that the leading edge vortex starts to grow immediately after
stroke reversal at a positive angle of attack. These kinematics
favor vortex development and augment lift production. In
contrast,  > 0

inhibits vortex generation. Figure 7 shows the negative

by solving the 2D Navier Stokes equation. The green curve shows quasi-
steady estimates (based on Dickinson’s formula [6]) and the red curve shows
sensor measurements. To eliminate wing driver inertial contributions and
sensor resonance, the 10 to 200Hz and > 500Hz harmonics are ﬁltered
out. The same ﬁlter is applied to the numerically computed forces. The wing
inertial contribution is also subtracted out from the sensor measurement.
We do not show the time varying drag measurement because the motion of

ﬂapping kinematics and wing morphology.
B. Identiﬁcation of unsteady effects
Downwash effect: Our simulation shows that an impul-
sively started wing generates more lift than that of a wing
already ﬂapped for several periods. Since the kinematics
in both cases are identical, the quasi-steady model predicts
identical lift and drag. However, as shown in Figure 8, the
pressure on the wing leading edge at T = 0:25 is more
negative than it is at T = 2:25, meaning that the instanta-
neous lift generated is larger atT = 0:25. This phenomenon
can be understood by comparing the y-component of the ve-
locity ﬁeld. A ﬂapping wing continuously generates lift and
transfers downward momentum to surrounding ﬂuid. This
downwash tends to reduce the translational lift generated by
the wing. In our simulation, the lift of the ﬁrst period is 17%
higher than the time-averaged lift.
Generation and shedding of vortices: A leading edge
vortex develops in the stroke acceleration phase and sheds
at the end of stroke deceleration phase. As discussed in the
previous section, this physical mechanism depends on ﬂow
ﬁeld history and cannot be modeled by classical quasi-steady
models. Figure 9 shows the vorticity ﬁeld and the corre-
sponding pressure ﬁeld to illustrate vortex generation and
vortex shedding processes. We can increase or reduce mean
lift by varying the phase lag between stroke translation and
pitch rotation.

ﬁeld is equivalent to that of the complete velocity ﬁeld. Regions of high vorticity (absolute value) correspond to regions of low pressure. A large vortex
grows on the leading edge of a translating wing and is shed during stroke reversal. A lift peak occurs near T=3.42 and T=3.91 during the stroke deceleration
phase.

Wake capture: Wake capture refers to the interaction
between a wing and its previously shed vortex in the stroke
acceleration phase. As described in [4], wake capture can
often lead to a secondary lift peak. In our simulation, wake
capture is beneﬁcial to lift generation in the ﬁrst period
but becomes detrimental to lift generation for subsequent
ﬂapping periods. As shown in Figure 5, the computed lift
coefﬁcient is negative in the stroke acceleration phase. We

can understand this phenomenon by studying pressure and
vorticity graphs shown in Figure 10. At T = 0:5 and
T = 1:5 we observe similar shed vortices. In the ﬁrst
period, the shed vortex moves over the leading edge and
convects to the opposite side of the wing at T = 0:7. The
corresponding pressure graphs show that the region of low
pressure convects to the wing upper surface, thus creating
more lift. On the other hand, the vortex shed at T = 1:5
moves along the lower wing surface and convects toward the
trailing edge. As a result, a low pressure region along lower
surface corresponds to lower lift. This phenomenon can be

The ﬁgures in the second row show the corresponding vorticity ﬁeld. During
wing translation (T=0.25), a leading edge vortex grows and as a result a
low pressure region on the wing upper surface leads to high lift. During

plummets. The pressure ﬁeld has units ofN=m

explained by the downwash effect, in which the downward
moving ﬂuid affects the vortex convection direction.
Through simulations, we ﬁnd that wake capture properties
can be enhanced by increasing stroke amplitude or shrinking
wing chord. Figure 11A compares vorticity plots of ﬂapping
motions with different stroke amplitudes. The shed vortex
convects along lower wing surface for L = 4mm; and it
convects to the upper wing surface for L = 6mm: The
corresponding lift coefﬁcients for a half ﬂapping period
(T = 2 to 2:5) is shown in Figure 11 B. While the primary
lift peaks in both cases are similar, we observed different
wake capture effects. During the stroke acceleration phase,
the lift coefﬁcient for L = 4mm is negative while the lift
coefﬁcient for L = 6mm is positive. As discussed in the
previous section, this difference depends on whether the shed
vortex convects along the lower wing surface or rolls over to
the upper surface. We ﬁnd that favorable wake capture leads
to 32% increase of mean lift coefﬁcient. This simulation
result implies that future wing design must have appropriate
stroke amplitude to chord length ratio to achieve favorable
wake capture effects.
V. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
This paper presents a computational tool designed specif-
ically to model the aerodynamic performance of RoboBee
ﬂapping ﬂight. Unlike classical quasi-steady models that
calculate aerodynamic forces based only on wing geometry
and kinematics, this numerical model identiﬁes unsteady
ﬂuid mechanisms that are important to improving propulsive
efﬁciency. More speciﬁcally, we quantify the effect of the
phase parameter on lift and drag production through simu-
lations. While holding other kinematic parameters constant,

future RoboBee design should utilize a stiff hinge to advance
passive wing pitch rotation. This computational result agrees
well with previous experimental ﬁndings [7].
In addition, our simulations show that wake capture effects
can be beneﬁcial or detrimental to lift production depending
on the movement of shed vortices. We can induce favorable
wake capture effects by increasing the ﬂapping amplitude

. Furthermore, we have validated
our numerical model by comparing simulation results to
quasi-steady predictions and experimental measurement. It
is shown that our numerical model gives a 44% percent
better approximation to 3D experiments than the quasi-steady
model in the least squares sense.
Whereas the quasi-steady model requires ﬁtting coef-
ﬁcients, this numerical model is rigorously derived from
Navier Stokes equations and does not require ﬁtting pa-

rameters. This property makes the numerical model more
reliable for future wing kinematics optimization studies.
Ensuing studies should further develop this computational
tool to optimize passive rotation kinematics. Whereas the
current model requires completely prescribing stroke and
hinge motion, the immersed boundary method can be im-
plemented to allow wing-ﬂuid interaction [15]. By deﬁning
wing stroke kinematics alone, future computational model
should return hinge kinematics along with force estimates. In
addition, particle image velocimetry techniques can be used
to compare experiment measurement with the computed ﬂow
ﬁeld.
