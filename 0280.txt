AbstractÑThis paper presents an odometer architecture 
which combines a monocular camera and an inertial measure-
ment unit (IMU). The trifocal tensor geometry relationship 
between three images is used as camera measurement infor-
mation, which makes the proposed method without estimating 
the 3D position of feature point. In other words, the proposed 
method does not have to reconstruct environment. Meanwhile, 
the camera pose corresponding to each of the three images are 
refined in filter to form a multi-state constraint Kalman filter 
(MSCKF). Consequently, this paper proposes a sliding window 
odometry which has a balance between computational cost and 
accuracy. Compared with traditional visual odometry or sim-
ultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) method, the pro-
posed method not only meets the requirement of odometer in the 
ego-motion estimation, but also suit for real-time application. 
This paper further proposes a random sample consensus 
(RANSAC) algorithm which is based on three views geometry. 
The RANSAC algorithm can effectively reject feature points 
which are mismatch or located on independently moving objects, 
thus it make the overall algorithm capable of operating in dy-
namic environment. Experiments are conducted to show the 
effectiveness of the proposed method in real environment. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
The recent advancement of MEMS technology makes the 
inertial measurement unit (IMU) small in size, low cost and 
power efficient. Thus, inertial navigation system (INS) based 
on an IMU have been widely used to estimate the trajectory of 
vehicle such as smart automobiles, micro air vehicles, robots, 
etc. However, due to error accumulation problem, it is very 
hard to get reliable result by only using the IMU. In order to 
tackle this problem, some INSs rely on GPS signal to peri-
odically correct the IMU. But in some GPS-denied environ-
ments (e.g., indoors, underground, in tunnel, in space, etc.), 
this method does not work. Besides, the quality of GPS signal 
is affected by surrounding environment. 
The camera is another choice to correct the IMU. Cameras 
are low cost, small size and can provide rich information 
about surrounding environment. By tracking feature points 
between several images, the motion of camera can be esti-
mated [1]. The camera and the IMU are complementary 
sensors [2]. The IMU has lower uncertainty of measurement 
at fast motion and the camera can track feature points pre-
cisely at slow motion. Furthermore, the IMU can provide real 
scale which usually cannot be obtained by only using single 
camera. Based on above reasons, a monocular camera and an

IMU are used for sensor fusion to estimate the ego-motion in 
this paper. Sensor fusion between the camera and the IMU is 
a popular research topic. It can provide many applications 
such as real scale estimation [3] [4], image de-blurring, IMU 
assisted feature tracking, ground plane detection, ego-motion 
estimation [5]-[9], etc. During the last two years, this research 
topic was trying to solve the initial condition problems [10]. 
The main purpose of this paper is the ego-motion estimation. 
Therefore, we propose an odometer architecture which com-
bines a monocular camera and an IMU. The camera geometry 
constraints between three images are used as camera meas-
urement information, which makes the proposed method 
without estimating the 3D position of feature point. Mean-
while, the camera pose corresponding to each of the three 
images are refined in filter to form a multi-state constraint 
Kalman filter (MSCKF). Consequently, the proposed method 
is a sliding window odometry which has a balance between 
computational cost and accuracy. In order to effectively reject 
feature points which are mismatch or fall on independently 
moving objects, the random sample consensus (RANSAC) 
algorithm based on three views geometry is used to choose 
inliers. 
This paper is organized as follows. Related work is de-
scribed in Section II. In Section III we explain our approach 
for visual assisted IMU odometer in detail. Experiments are 
described in Section IV. Finally, Section V concludes this 
paper. 
II. RELATED WORK 
In general, there are two ways that the ego-motion can be 
estimated in map, which are visual odometry and visual 
simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) [11]. Visual 
odometry is a technique that estimates the ego-motion by 
using single or multiple cameras. The term visual odometry 
was first proposed by Nister et al. [12]. The reason for its 
name is similar with wheel odometry that both are estimating 
the motion trajectory by using the measurement information 
of sensors. Visual SLAM can be treated as corresponding 
research of visual odometry. In visual SLAM, Davison et al. 
first proposed one method of visual SLAM which only use 
single camera, and they named it monoSLAM [13]. In order 
to solve the depth estimation problem caused by parametri-
zation of feature points in monoSLAM, Civera et al. proposed 
inverse depth parametrization to describe feature points [14]. 
After that, Civera et al. further proposed 1-point RANSAC 
method to reject unsuitable feature points [15]. The main 
difference between visual SLAM and visual odometry is that 
the goal of visual SLAM is keeping tracking the map of the 
environment, while visual odometry aims at estimating the 
motion trajectory incrementally. Considering our application 
which is the motion trajectory estimation, this paper focuses

on visual odometry. 
The most intuitive way to fuse IMU and monoSLAM is 
using the IMU motion model to replace the constant velocity 
motion model assumed in monoSLAM [5]. This method 
belongs to the tightly-coupled sensor fusion architecture. 
However, it is a SLAM-type method. The 3D position of 
feature point is estimated in the filter state vector that causes 
the following two problems: (1) the 3D position of feature 
point is assumed as Gaussian distribution and (2) as the 
number of feature points increase, the size of the filter state 
vector becomes enormous, resulting in more computational 
effort. In order to solve the above problems and focus on 
estimating the ego-motion, Mourikis et al. proposed a method 
that does not require estimating the 3D position of feature 
point in the filter state vector [6]. They use several past 
camera poses as the filter state vector. In measurement update 
step, the camera poses in the filter state vector are used to 
estimate the 3D position of feature point by a least square 
solution and then the 3D position of feature point is 
re-projected back to each camera pose which is used as the 
measurement model. Based on this, they proposed a MSCKF. 
The MSCKF is a sliding window odometry which has a 
balance between computational cost and accuracy.  
In original MSCKF, it still requires a least square solution 
to estimate the 3D position of feature point. However, from 
the viewpoint of visual odometry, estimating the 3D point of 
feature point is not necessary, because it does not focus on 
reconstructing the map. In order to avoid estimating the 3D 
point of feature point, we use the camera geometry con-
straints (epipolar geometry and trifocal tensor) between three 
images as camera measurement information. In the literature, 
method that used trifocal tensor as the measurement model of 
Kalman filter can be traced back to the monocular visual 
odometry proposed by Ying-Kin et al. in 2006 [16]. Rather 
than only using epipolar geometry as measurement model [7], 
using trifocal tensor additionally can provide the consistent 
scale. After that, methods that use the camera geometry con-
straints as measurement information in different types of 
sensors were proposed (e.g., stereo camera [17], stereo cam-
era with IMU [8], monocular camera with IMU [9], etc.). In 
this paper, we use the filter state design methodology of 
MSCKF and the camera geometry constraints between three 
images to propose a sliding window odometry which use a 
monocular camera and an IMU. In the following, we describe 
the algorithm in detail.

the IMU in the global frame. Fig. 1 shows the geometric

C. Measurement update 
The measurement model employed for updating the filter 
state estimate is given by the epipolar geometry and the tri-
focal tensor. As shown in Fig. 2, the epipolar geometry de-
scribes the geometry relationship between two images of the 
same static scene [1]. 
 
Fig. 2. the epipolar geometry between two views 
The algebraic representation of epipolar geometry can be 
derived by the fundamental matrix F . Let t and R be the 
position and rotation matrix of the frame 
2
C
 with respect to 
the frame 
1
C
. Then, the fundamental matrix is defined as 
1 TT??
?? ??
??
F K R t K
, where K is the camera intrinsic pa-
rameter matrix which can be obtained after camera calibra-
tion. Since the image point 
2

 lies on the epipolar line 
21 m
? l Fm
, the epipolar geometry constraint is given by: 
21

         (14) 
The trifocal tensor encapsulates the geometry relationships 
between the three different viewpoints and is independent of 
the scene structure [1]. Fig. 3 shows the point-line-point 
correspondence between three views which can be used to 
transfer the image point by the trifocal tensor.

geometry and the trifocal tensor is given by the following

D. RANSAC 
In order to reject feature points which are mismatch or 
located on independently moving objects, we use RANSAC 
algorithm to select inliers. In Kalman filter, the procedure of 
RANSAC algorithm in this paper is similar to 1-point 
RANSAC EKF [15]. However, since the proposed method 
does not estimate the 3D position of feature point, it cannot 
use Euclidean distance to decide inlier by re-project the 3D 
position of feature point. Therefore, the proposed method 
uses the trifocal tensor to decide inlier:

Since the trifocal tensor is derived under static assumption, 
the criterion (20) can detect the feature points located on 
independently moving objects which makes the overall algo-
rithm capable of operating in dynamic environment.

IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 
The proposed method is evaluated by using a publicly 
available real-world dataset [20]. The Matlab code of the 
proposed method can be downloaded from the internet [24]. 
In KITTI dataset, the sensor used for data recording consist of 
two grayscale and two color video cameras (Point Grey Flea2, 
10 Hz, 1392?512 pixel resolution, 90
o
?35
o
 opening angle), a 
laser scanner and a GPS/IMU INS (OXTS RT 3003, 100 Hz). 
The proposed method only uses the measurements of a single 
grayscale camera and the IMU (acceleration and angular 
velocity) to estimate the ego-motion. 
Geiger et al. [20] provided two versions of data which are 
raw and synchronized. After the manual synchronization, the 
IMU sampling rate is 10Hz. Since the synchronization be-
tween the camera and the IMU is important, we use the 
synchronized data to verify the proposed method. In the ex-
periments, the extraction and matching of feature points are 
performed using the SIFT algorithm [21]. In order to maintain 
a certain amount of computational cost, we use the Òbucket-
ingÓ concept [17] to choose a subset of feature points. The 
initial velocity of the IMU and the initial direction of gravity 
were obtained from GPS/IMU INS. We use Euclidean dis-
tance and rotation angle to define position and orientation 
error and use a table to show overall RMSE and end point 
error. The proposed method is compared with the following 
methods: (1) GPS/IMU INS and use it as ground truth, (2) 
pure IMU navigation which is obtained by integrating accel-
eration and angular velocity and (3) monocular and stereo 
visual odometry proposed by Geiger et al. [22]. In the fol-
lowing, the experiments are conducted in three cases. 
A.   Case 1 
The trajectory is about 540 m, takes 78 sec. The average 
speed is about 25 km/h. Fig. 4 shows the motion trajectory 
estimation results. It can be found that the result of the pure 
IMU navigation is not reliable with the IMU error accumu-
lation. As shown in TABLE 1, the proposed method outper-
forms the other methods in the overall RMSE and end point 
error. It is worth noting that the angle from the pure IMU 
navigation is more close to the ground truth than the position. 
The main reason is that the angle is obtained by using single 
integration, while the position is obtained by using double 
integral. Furthermore, the orientation error would propagate 
to the position error in the gravity compensation step. The 
result of the monocular visual odometry is better than the pure 
IMU navigation. In general, the real scale cannot be obtained 
by only using single camera. In this monocular visual odom-
etry, the real scale is derived by assuming that the camera is 
moving at a known and fixed height on the ground. 
B.  Case 2 
The trajectory is about 2160 m, takes 94.5 sec. The average 
speed is about 82 km/h. The data in case 2 was acquired on 
the highway. Thus, the average speed in case 2 is much faster 
than case 1. The motion trajectory estimation results are 
shown in Fig. 5 and TABLE 2. It can be found that the result 
of the pure IMU navigation in case 2 is more reliable than in 
case 1. The main reason is that the IMU has lower uncertainty 
of measurement at fast motion which makes the better inte-
gration result. 
C.  Case 3 
The trajectory is about 3577 m, takes 440 sec. The average 
speed is about 29 km/h. The path in this case is longer than in 
case 1 or case 2. Fig. 6 and TABLE 3 show the motion tra-
jectory estimation results. After the three cases, we conclude 
that the motion trajectory estimated by the sensor fusion of 
two different sensors is more reliable.

V. CONCLUSIONS 
This paper presents an odometer architecture which 
combines a monocular camera and an IMU. The trifocal 
tensor geometry relationship between three images is used as 
camera measurement information, which makes the proposed 
method without estimating the 3D position of feature point. 
Meanwhile, the camera pose corresponding to each of the 
three images are refined in filter to form a MSCKF. The 
proposed method has the following characteristics: (1) 
tightly-coupled sensor fusion approach, (2) structure-less 
visual inertial odometry and (3) perform optimization over a 
sliding window of filter states. This paper further proposes a 
RANSAC algorithm which is based on three views geometry 
to select inliers. The experiments are conducted to show the 
effectiveness of the proposed method by using a publicly 
available real-world dataset. The results show the error of the 
IMU can be effectively constrained by the proposed method 
and the estimated ego-motion is close to the actual path.
