Abstract— Tractor-trailer freight hauling has increased
markedly within the United States over the past several years,
resulting in higher truck volumes. commercial heavy vehicle
drivers are required under federal Hours Of Services rules
to rest and take breaks to mitigate driving while fatigued.
Although there are many rest area facilities available to truck
drivers, there is a lack of persistent timely information on truck
parking availability. An automated real-time sensing system to
directly detect and disseminate parking space occupancy from
truck parking facilities is described in detail. The methodology
and system architecture are presented in which robust, per-
sistent, parking occupancy detection is achieved by extending
Structure from Motion (SfM) techniques using a multiplicity
of commercial, off-the-shelf cameras. The system architecture
allows the approach to be scaled to a region-wide comprehensive
truck parking information system for commercial heavy vehicle
drivers and operators. Per parking space detection accuracy
of 99% is achieved over continuous operation. Classiﬁcation
accuracy under diverse scene and parking behavior scenarios
is discussed.
I. INTRODUCTION
There is general acceptance among policy makers and the
research community that driver fatigue increases crash risk
and is a contributing factor in motor vehicle crashes ( [1], [2],
[3]). Driving heavy vehicles such as commercial semi-tractor
trucks have received considerable attention due to their
weight and size. In 2009, 3,380 people were killed in truck
crashes (including 503 Commercial Motor Vehicle (CMV)
drivers) and 74,000 were injured. The link between heavy
vehicle fatigue and increased crash risk has led to stepped up
enforcement of hours of services rules in the United States
to limit allowable driving time, requiring drivers to obtain
a minimum amount of rest during and between their shifts
[4]. Although, there are many rest area facilities available to
truck drivers, studies found truck drivers routinely complain
about the difﬁculty of obtaining information on truck parking
availability for these facilities [5].
Increasing the number of truck stops and rest areas, or
adding capacity to existing ones, may be either ﬁnancially
intractable, or incompatible with local restrictions. Intelligent
Transportation System (ITS) technologies can be used to

provide real-time information that would redirect drivers to
nearby facilities with available parking, thereby utilizing the
existing capacity more effectively [6]. A review of proposed
techniques to monitor vehicle parking capacity is presented
next.
Real-time parking monitoring methodologies can be cate-
gorized as indirect and direct. Indirect methodologies are
based on detecting and classifying vehicles at all ingress
and egress points of the parking facility and summing
the difference over accumulated counts at speciﬁed time
intervals, as opposed to directly monitoring each parking
space status. The indirect approach has been facilitated using
pavement embedded wireless magnetometers ([5], [7]) or
computer vision ([8]). Although ingress-egress count de-
tection is intuitively obvious, the general problem is that
small counting and vehicle classiﬁcation errors accumulated
over time which led to unacceptably high parking occupancy
errors. For example due to non-stationary sensor bias, an
approximate count error of about one vehicle per day was
observed for facilities providing 27 to 35 truck parking stalls
[7]. An occupancy detection accuracy of 96% was stated as
the threshold for an acceptable level of accuracy [8].
There have been many proposed methodologies reported
in literature to directly monitor parking spaces using camera
sensors. Modi et. al [9] demonstrated a computer vision-
based approach to directly detect space occupancy of ve-
hicles utilizing a foreground/background blob segmenta-
tion algorithm based on time-variant mixture of Gaussians
combined with shadow removal. Researchers in [10] or-
thorectiﬁed 2D camera views of vehicle parking spaces
into a top-down viewpoint before segmenting each parking
space. A Markov Random Field model is used to impose
a penalty cost to disambiguate overlapping probabilities in
adjacent parking spaces that lead to conﬂicting conclusions
of occupancy, based on mean pixel color features compared
to an apriori color feature model of empty spaces. They
reported an accuracy range from 76% to 94%. True [11]
computes color (in Y-CrCB space) histograms of parking
space regions deﬁned a-priori. The luminance component is
discarded to mitigate intensity changes in the scene. The
histograms were compared with a training set of histograms
to classify the space with an accuracy between 68% and
94%. Seo & Urmson [12] utilized ﬂy-over aerial images
to train an SVM linear classiﬁer. A classiﬁcation accuracy
of 91.5% was achieved in one non-training Google aerial
photo. Bong et. al [13] used color subtraction from an a-
priori vacant background image to obtain large difference
binary blobs which were ANDed with Sobel edge detection

of the difference image. Shadow removal was obtained by
discriminating the density of edges in a shadow vs. a vehicle.
The system was not tested under various lighting conditions.
In [14], a Bayesian discriminator was designed from Princi-
pal Component Analysis (PCA) using Canny edge density,
variance of intensity, and pixel correlation with a background
image for one private vehicle parking space. 1,687 camera
images collected over 14 days were analyzed with a detection
rate of 99%. Researchers in [15] computed Harr-like features
within 24x24 pixel patches to discriminate between empty,
and occupied spaces (from background empty space model)
Thirty samples were analyzed for a region of interest of four
parking spaces, with a classiﬁcation accuracy between 90%
and 100%.
To conclude, there are a number of challenges with
such 2D image computer vision techniques arising from
rapid changes in background illumination, glare, and partial
occlusions from overlapping vehicles. The latter problem
is especially exacerbated with commercial heavy vehicles
because of their larger size and height relative to private
vehicles.
II. METHODOLOGY FOR PARKING DETECTION
A. Overview
3D Reconstruction or SfM (Structure from Motion) uses a
multiplicity of images from uncalibrated cameras at arbitrary
positions which observe a common scene and then use
features from these images to reconstruct a 3D representation
of the scene. In this system, images from three cameras are
combined to reconstruct the scene (Fig. 2). The nature of the
3D reconstruction can avoid the typical challenges of shad-
ows and occlusion encountered in the aforementioned 2D
approaches. Image correspondence recognizes, for instance
that a shadow on the ground exists on a ﬂat surface rather
than an “edge” of some object. Likewise, occlusions are
resolved by using a different point of view in 3D space where
they do not interfere with object recognition. Segmentation
of objects of interest from the background can then be com-
pletely unaffected by these typical 2D pitfalls. Furthermore,
environmental factors such as lighting and weather do not
affect classiﬁcation as long as reconstruction does not fail for
lack of discernible image features. For example, during rain
and snow the method succeeded since falling snow (Figure
3) or rain was not reconstructed as part of the scene.
The approach is that, using the 3D reconstruction of the
truck parking lot with known 3D locations of the parking
lanes, the scene is transformed into real-world coordinates
and then geometric techniques are used to segment and
sample the 3D space above the parking space to determine
if an object such as a vehicle occupies the space (Fig. 1,
bottom of 2).
B. Scene Reconstruction
The methodology used in this paper is an SfM implemen-
tation that uses Bundle adjustment and Patch-based Multi-
View Stereo (PMVS) [18], [19] to achieve reconstruction.

The theory and approach of this software are described
brieﬂy.
First, SIFT features [20] are collected from each image and
are then matched across images to determine candidate image
coordinates corresponding to commonly observed real world
coordinates. These feature correspondences are used as priors
for the Bundler optimization bundle adjustment procedure.
Given some camera matrix P
i
for an image i, we let X
j
represent the 3D position of a point j and x
ij
to represent an
estimated 2D position for that point in an image i. For this
case the total re-projection error can be stated as:
X
i;j
d(P
i
X
j
;x
ij
)
2
(1)
where d() represents the image distance of the reprojected
point to the location of the feature which was projected.
Minimization of this error is the goal of bundle adjustment.
The minimization technique used is the Levenberg-Marquard
(LM) optimization procedure. This non-linear least squares
minimization is a combination of steepest descent and Gauss-
Newton helps to optimize the convergence such that it
converges quickly from initial guesses. EXIF data from the
images is used to seed the focal length of the cameras. The
end result is that the Bundler [21] estimates the intrinsic
and extrinsic camera parameters and also produces a sparse
reconstruction of the scene.
The camera parameters obtained from the Bundler are
used to initialize the PMVS. PMVS (Patch-based Multi-view
Stereo Software) is “a... algorithm for calibrated multi-view
stereopsis that outputs a (quasi) dense set of rectangular
patches covering the surfaces visible in the input images”
[18]. The reconstruction happens through an iterative process
of matching, expanding, and ﬁltering. Patch based features
are matched along epipolar lines and are considered in depth
order (distance from 3D world coordinate to optical center
of camera) starting with the closest. The ﬁrst patch along
an epipolar line that is photo-consistent in at least three
images is selected. After selection, expansion occurs by
adding neighbor patches that also meet a photo-consistency
criteria. After expansion, ﬁltering occurs. Expanded patches
are removed if they correlate poorly, or if they seem to occur
inside an object’s surface, or are determined to be an outlier
in terms of photo-consistency.
In this utilization of Bundler/PMVS, camera focal lengths
and CCD element size were utilized as initialization param-
eters for the Bundler, with a large penalty weighting set for
focal length as the camera calibrations indicated that focal
length remained nearly constant.
The aforementioned bundled optimization solution for
intrinsic and extrinsic multi-camera parameters in [21] is
expressed in an arbitrary scale and world coordinate system
and is affected by the initial putative matches between the
captured image sets. A robust registration method is required
to accurately align the (quasi) dense reconstructions with the
parking spaces and surface of the lot. The procedure to do
so is described next.
C. Registration and Alignment
First, the 3D end-lane and mid-lane locations, L
i
;i =
1::m, for each parking stall were surveyed using a DGPS
system with sub-decimeter accuracy (measurements between
digitized points were within 0.1 meters at 2 standard devia-
tions inX andY , using a local State Plane UTM projection).
For 15 lanes, m = (15 + 1) 3 = 48 surveyed 3D
coordinates. For each image set I
n
;n = 1::3, in a time
sample s is acquired, the Bundler intrinsic and extrinsic
parameters are determined for each camera. Then for each
camera image I
n
in the set of images, image points, p
i;n
,
are extracted which correspond to a visible 3D survey points
L
i
. The intrinsic and extrinsic solution then are used to back-
project each undistorted 2D coordinatep

into its equiva-
lent world coordinate,

using each camera pair, (j;k). With

, and 3) the estimate associated with
the largest projection angle the betweenu

. For each
set of estimates, RANSAC with least-squares ﬁt of a plane
is used to eliminate outliers out-of-plane plane points. The
remaining set ofr back projected coordinates in the acquired
time sample s are then used to estimate an optimal uniform
scale factor, S

, rotation matrix,R

, and translation vector,

[17],[22]. The algorithm in [17] is modiﬁed slightly by
ﬁrst normalizing each coordinate

Recall that from the time sample s three separate sets

) are used to compute their
representative rotation, translation and uniform scale param-

selected based on the aforementioned transformation param-
eters which produce the smallest RMS error between the
transformed back projected coordinates,

.
Typically, a RMS error of 0.5 meters was observed along
any axis which resulted in signiﬁcant detection errors. A
second alignment reﬁnement step was developed to correct
for non-linear scale effects in the real-world 3D space. A
ﬁrst order correction in the horizontalx;y plane is estimated
from the matching set, of r correspondences,

nents of the transformed dense PMVS reconstruction points,

.
The elevation correction procedure searches for good
candidate dense points that are representative of the parking
lot surface using the following 2-step ﬁltering method. First,
an elevation boundary is placed above, and below, the plane
based on the aforementioned RMS error along the vertical
axis relative to the reference survey points
^
L
i
. The second
step ﬁlters the remaining dense reconstruction points by
applying a threshold of the directional difference of the
computed PMVS patch surface normals from the estimated
parking lot surface normal. The threshold value ofj20

j was
determined experimentally. This procedure reduced the RMS
error between
^
L
i
0
and
^
L
i
to within 0.3m under most cases,
which has proven thus far to provide sufﬁcient alignment for
robust classiﬁcation.
D. Classiﬁcation
A classiﬁer was designed based on estimating the above-
plane 3D point probabilities within each parking space with
respect to the total number of reconstructed 3D points.
The estimate is computed by segmenting and summing the
above-plane points which lie within a 6-sided convex 3D
polyhedron, deﬁned by intersecting 4 vertical planes aligned
with the vertical Z-axis and coincident with the parking
lanes and their front/back end points, and a horizontal
plane elevated 5 meters above the parking lot surface (US
regulation height for semi-tractor trailers is 4.15m). Based
on empirical observation, a cut-off of 0.2 meters above the
parking lot surface was selected to ﬁlter above-plane parking
lot surface points from the parking lot plane (Fig. 2). The 3D
point probabilities associated with ground truth observations
are then used to determine an optimal decision boundary for
occupancy which minimized type I (False Positives) and type
II (False Negatives) errors using a Golden Search algorithm.
An initial set of 21,588 parking observations collected in
the ﬁrst half of 2013 was used as a training set to build
the classiﬁer (6 spaces 3; 598 samples). The collected
data expressed variations in parking behaviors, vehicles,
environmental conditions and, seasonal weather, during both
day time (51.8%) vs. night time (48.2%) periods. An optimal
decision ratio boundary of 0.0075 yielded a total error rate of
2:2%, which corresponds to a detection accuracy = 100%
(1 (FN +FP )=N) = 100%(1 (326+137)=21; 588) =
97:8%.
III. SYSTEM DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION
A detection system (Fig. 4) has been deployed at a state
sponsored rest area which is accessible to west bound trafﬁc
on a major interstate highway approximately 25 miles west of
Twin Cities in Minnesota. The truck parking facilities design
consists of a single row of 15 dedicated parking spaces,
4.26m wide and 26.0m in length. Three camera poles were
placed along the perimeter of the parking facilities between
14.7 and 9.1 meters from the front boundary of the parking
spaces. Each pole can support the multi-view SfM algorithm
by allowing up to three commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS)
HD 1920x1090 PTZ network cameras to be mounted across
a horizontal bar providing an end-to-end 4.2 meter baseline
at the top of 10.7 meter (35 ft.) crank-down poles.
Fig. 4: System design.
For this speciﬁc site conﬁguration, about 5 to 6 spaces can
3992
be captured simultaneously by overlapping three PTZ cam-
eras such that their focal centers are approximately aligned
with a 55

horizontal ﬁeld of view. The aforementioned
algorithm is implemented on a desktop PC with an Intel
i7 3770K 3.5Ghz Quad-core processor running Linux kernel
3.2.0-23. PC and communication hardware reside within the
visitor shelter of the rest area. Below grade conduit carries
power and commutations from the shelter to each crank-
down camera pole.
Real-time count and occupancy data for the site are
uploaded to a relational database, and web-based data distri-
bution server (DDS). The DDS records the reception time
and stores the report in a relational database. The data
is also disseminated to three different information portal
systems: 1. Web-based information dissemination portal, 2.
In-cab services, and 3. Roadside Changeable Message Signs
via an XML feed queried with the RESTful interface or
an FTP connection. An Intelligent Roadway Information
System server (IRIS) [23] queries the DDS to communicate
with roadside Variable Message Signs using a standardized
(NTCIP) communication protocol [24].
IV. RESULTS
In order to investigate the persistence in detection accuracy
for this study, historical data were harvested.at either 2 or
5 minute intervals over the course of 96 hours during late
summer (August 2013). The parking state for each observed
parking space in the sets of data were manually labeled. Note
that other observed phenomena that may affect detection
or the observation were also categorized as: 1) vehicles
double-parked/encroaching onto an adjacent lane, 2) parking
space utilization from a non-commercial heavy vehicle 3)
observable environmental conditions, 4) camera obstructions,
and 5) truck maneuvers, such as pulling in, or pulling out of
the space.

Fig. 5: Performance by time of day (local-time).
For the August 2013 data, the individual ground truth
tables for each parking space indicate an overall detection ac-
curacy of 99.01%, with the lowest accuracy equal to 95.93%
and the highest accuracy equal to 100.0%. Over 95.3% of the
samples produced correct occupancy classiﬁcations, while
4.29% had one incorrect occupancy classiﬁcation and the
remaining 0.31% had two or more incorrect classiﬁcations.
In Table II, speciﬁcity refers to the true parking space occu-
pancy detection rate calculated by 100%(TP=(TP +FN))
and sensitivity refers to the space vacancy detection rate
calculated by 100% (TN=(TN + FP )). Similar to the
training set, sensitivity trended lower than speciﬁcity. Despite
these errors, the level of accuracy demonstrates a persistent
high level of performance for detection and classiﬁcation.
Fig. 5 illustrates time-of-day performance trends for all
15 parking spaces, by aggregating the data into 1 hour
bins (Table I). Daylight hours (6:00 AM - 8:00 PM) had
an average accuracy of 99.51% while night hours had an
average accuracy of 98.36%. Note that the proportions of
day time and night time observations were 57% and 43%
respectively. Analysis of the miss-classiﬁcation indicates that
typical sources of error include: edge cases of ground truth
such as when vehicles are pulling in or out of the space,
double parking cases where slight encroachments of vehicles
crossing over the lane line were observed, and low light
conditions with dark colored vehicles which resulted in inac-
curate 3D reconstruction and coordinate system realignment.
Low light induced miss-classiﬁcation could be improved by
additional on-site lighting.
V. CONCLUSIONS
The efﬁcacy of a novel sensing method was presented that
leverages recent advances in 3D SfM techniques to extract
truck parking occupancy from adjacent multiple camera
views of the scene. This differs from other computer vision
approaches found in literature to address parking occupancy
detection. The method is robust in snowy weather and under
various lighting conditions. It is able to detect a variety
of vehicles including different truck types and passenger
cars. With this technique, the same group of cameras can
also be used to capture several overlapping regions of the
lot to reconstruct several parking spaces, thereby leveraging
economies of scale for such a system. Longer term ﬁeld

studies regarding the efﬁcacy of this technology will be done
with additional rest area installations in order to more fully
assess long term performance and reﬁne it. Future plans are
to expand the system to several more rest areas along an
Interstate highway corridor as part of a region-wide, real-time
truck parking information system as well as gather detailed
long-term historical information on parking utilization.
