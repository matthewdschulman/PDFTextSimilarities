Abstract— Aiming to design a soft robotic fish with more 
natural, more flexible and high-performance movements 
through biomimetic method, we are developing a soft robotic fish 
with body/caudal fin (BCF) propulsion by using piezoelectric 
fiber composite (PFC) as actuator. Compared with conventional 
rigid robotic fish, the design and control of the soft robotic fish 
are difficult and hard to reveal its dynamic performances due to 
the large deformation of flexible structure and complicated 
coupling dynamics with fluid. That’s why the design and control 
method of the soft robotic fish has not been established, and we 
need to study it by considering the interaction between flexible 
structure and fluid. In this paper, fluid-structural coupling 
analysis based on acoustics method is applied to consider the 
fluid effect and predict the dynamic responses of soft robotic fish 
using PFC in fluid. Basic driving and governing equations of soft 
robotic fish in the fluid are firstly described. Then the numerical 
acoustics coupling analysis is performed. The calculated results 
are congruent well with experiments on dynamic responses. 
Finally, based on this coupling method, a new prototype of soft 
robotic fish is proposed by optimization for improvement. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
Biomimetic robots make a lot of irreplaceable 
contributions in human life with the development of 
interdisciplinary sciences, including the science of electronic 
information and biological technology [1]-[4]. Many 
researchers concentrate on the field of biomimetic robots, 
especially on the development of biomimetic robotic fish by 
mimicking the real creatures [4]-[10] such as Robotuna of 
MIT, Essex robotic fish in London aquarium, robotic fish with 
rigid tail of MSU, snake-like robot (AmphiBot) of EPFL, 
SSSA Lamprey robot, FILOSE robot from Tallinn University, 
NanyangAwana (NAF-I), robotic eel of Methran Mojarrad 
group, and so on.  In these researches, the fishes become one 
of the focuses to be mimicked due to their high efficiency, 
good flexibility and maneuverability. Some fishlike robots are 
available for the seabed rescue, exploration, observation and 
other special underwater work, currently [1]-[5]. 
In these fishlike robots, the propulsion methodologies are 
various, such as by conventional motor mechanism [6]-[9] and 
by artificial muscle mechanism [10]-[15]. Among the 
propulsion mechanisms, the motor mechanism is simple but 
lack of flexibility with high energy cost. The robots usually 
have large size and heavy weight with rigid materials and 
complex control system [16]. Artificial muscle mechanism

using electrostatic film, shape memory alloy (SMA), PZT 
film, ionic polymer petal composite (IPMC), giant 
magnetostrictive alloy (GMA) or PFC is soft and flexible. The 
robotic fish with artificial muscle mechanism can obtain 
relatively good propulsion like real fish. 
When designing a soft robotic fish, a surrounding fluid 
must be considered. The fluid increases the system mass, 
stiffness and damping, changes the mechanical dynamic 
characteristics of the contained structure. To fully study the 
dynamic response of the soft robotic fish, we must take into 
account the dynamic interaction between the fluid and robot 
structure, and model the coupling mechanism accurately for 
fluid-structure interaction (FSI) analysis [17]. 
A broad class of FSI problems involves a fluid without 
significant flow and the main concern in the fluid is the 
pressure wave propagation. The acoustics fluid-structure 
coupled method considering the acoustic pressure can be used 
to solve these FSI problems and predict vibrational modes and 
transient responses of the structures in the fluid. M. B. Xu 
[18], S. M. Ai, et al. [19] studied the vibration response of 
underwater cylindrical shells through the fluid-structure 
coupled acoustic analysis. D. J. Nefske, et al. analyzed the 
vehicle vibration by a coupled finite element model [20]. Carl 
Howard presented a vibration analysis of an infinite duct 
divided by a thin panel through a coupled structural acoustic 
analysis [21]. H. Djojodihardjo applied the acoustic-structure 
interaction technology with finite element method (FEM) into 
spacecraft structures [22]. These studies provide a basis of 
flow formulation and boundary conditions of fluid-structural 
coupling analysis. However, the coupling problem is very 
difficult to be solved and design method of the soft robotic 
fish has not been established due to the large deformation of 
flexible structure and complicated coupling dynamics. It 
motivates us to investigate the design and control of the soft 
robotic fish by analytical simulation on coupling effect 
between the soft structure and fluid. 
Due to the relatively higher efficiency, higher acceleration 
and faster swimming speed, the BCF propulsion is more 
favorite in the design. In the present research, we utilize the 
PFC as soft actuator to develop a soft robotic fish with BCF 
propulsion. PFC can be constructed to a simple structure with 
high efficiency of energy conversion and large response of 
displacement. In this paper, the acoustics fluid-structural 
coupling analysis using FEM is applied to predict the dynamic 
vibration response of the soft robotic fish in the fluid. 
Well-established experiments are performed to validate its 
vibration response with coupling method. Finally, a new 
optimal structure and prototype are proposed by this 
established coupling method for improvement.

The aim of this study is not only to develop a soft robotic 
fish by PFC, but to establish the coupling method of 
underwater robot for propulsion improvement. By the verified 
coupling method, the dynamic vibrational frequencies and 
mode shapes of a structure in the fluid can be predicted and 
utilized to design different propulsion. Various propulsion 
such as caudal fin, snake-like body or pectoral fin propulsion 
can be generated based on different vibrational modes in the 
fluid. The corresponding oscillating, undulating or flapping 
motion also can be expected by different mode actuation. 
II. MATERIALS AND BASIC THEORY 
A. Piezoelectric Fiber Composite 
We choose one of typical PFC, macro fiber composite 
(MFC) [15], as a soft actuator due to its large displacement 
response and high efficiency. Figure 1 shows the structure and 
driving model of the MFC. The piezoceramic fiber is 
embedded in epoxy to make a rectangular plate. The plate is 
sandwiched by two pieces of polyimide film on which the 
interdigitated electrodes are placed. Based on thermodynamic 
theory, when a voltage from -500V to +1500V is applied on 
MFC, the strain and stress will be generated, and a driving 
load can be finally obtained by (1). The structure can be 
expanded and contracted in the direction of the fibers by the 
driving load [23].

distance between the electrodes of MFC; P is driving load. 
When the MFC combines with a thin elastic plate, it will 
generate bending or torsion deformation due to resonance. We 
utilize the resonant bending deformation to design the soft fish 
robot with BCF propulsion. The carbon-fiber-reinforced 
polymer (CFRP) is adopted as the thin elastic plate. 
B. Theory of Acoustics Fluid-Structural Coupling 
Addressing the acoustic structural interaction problems, 
the FEM is widely used to predict the dynamic responses of 
the structure submerged in fluid. The entire problem domain is 
divided into elements rather than only bounding surface of the 
domain. In this paper, we use the FEM to deal with the 
fluid-structural coupling problem through ANSYS software. 
Acoustic elements satisfy the required fluid-structural 
coupling at the interface because they have four DOFs: three 
for displacement and one for pressure. A consistent matrix 
coupling is set up between the structural and fluid elements in 
which strongly coupling causes no convergence problems. 
The FSI analysis by ANSYS acoustic program assumes 
the fluid is ideal fluid and meets the following conditions: 
firstly, the fluid is non-flowing, inviscid and compressible, but 
allows only relatively small pressure changes with respect to 
the mean pressure; secondly, the amplitude in acoustic domain 
is relatively small for small variation in fluid density; thirdly, 
there is no heat transfer. The transfer between the wave 
propagation and thermodynamics is adiabatic. 
The interaction between the fluid and structure at the 
interface causes the acoustic pressure to exert a force applied 
to the structure and the structural motion produces an effective 
fluid load. The governing finite element matrix equation in the 
coupled analysis is shown as (2) [24]. In the coupled system, 
the fluid damping effect is considered as the external loads of 
structure rather than damping matrix C
s
. Thus, the external 
loads of structure F
s
 is composed of the driving loads from (1) 
and the fluid damping effect in the fish robot system. Both 
structural and fluid loads are transferred at the fluid-structure 
interface. The nodes on the fluid-structure interface have both 
displacement and pressure DOF. If F
s
 equals zero, (2) will 
become the equation of coupled modal analysis for the robot.

cylinder is placed on the head to constrain its motion and 
increase the displacement of the tail end. This constrained 
structure is similar to a cantilever beam. The body height is 
varied toward the tail end and it is smallest at the place where 
the caudal fin connects to fish body. Low density blowing 
agent as the float is placed on the top to balance the robot 
weight in the experiment. The MFC of M-8528-P1 type is 
adopted [25]. The total length of the robot is 167mm. Table I 
shows the robot’s material properties.

B. Structural Dynamic Analysis 
Structural dynamic vibration analysis and transient 
analysis (time-history analysis) are used to determine the 
dynamic responses of the soft robot. Three-dimensional (3-D) 
acoustic fluid element FLUID30 is used to model the fluid 
domain and the interface in the FSI analysis. It has eight 
corner nodes and each node has four DOFs. 3-D solid element 
SOLID186 is adopted to describe the robot structure domain. 
As shown in Fig. 3, a spherical surface is set as the boundary 
of the fluid domain, whose diameter is 220mm. A pressure 
load is applied on the outer border of the fluid domain. The 
soft robot is placed in the middle of the static fluid and its 
finite element model is presented in Fig. 3(b). The number of 
the total grid nodes for whole computational domain is 
140,886 and number of the total elements is 244,105.

Due to the high voltage of MFC, the Fluorinert Electronic 
Liquid FC3283 is adopted to describe the properties of the 
fluid, whose density is 1820 kg/m
3
. It is a fully-fluorinated 
liquid. Its composition will not shift or fractionate with time. It 
keeps fluid loss to a minimum and insures the fluid transport 
properties are stable. Based on above computational domain, 
the coupling vibration analysis of the soft robot is firstly 
studied. There isn’t any fixed support on robot. The 
vibrational frequencies of the soft robot in the fluid are shown 
in Table II, where the first six mode frequencies are presented.

Mode 1 2 3 4 5 6 
Robot  5.99 16.55 24.99 36.3 43.8 57.8 
When the geometry size of the fluid is changed, there is 
almost no influence on vibrational frequencies. The change in 
fluid volume has little effect on natural frequencies of the 
robot. The far-field condition is applied to the fluid 
successfully. The corresponding vibrational modes are shown 
in Fig. 4, where we mainly concern the bending deformation 
and the first two bending modes are described. The 
experimental results are measured by the high speed camera. 
The first torsion mode occurs on the caudal fin at 16.55Hz. 
When the driving frequencies are about 6Hz and 25Hz, we 
obtain the first and second bending mode, respectively. They 
have the similar mode shapes at the corresponding frequencies 
between the simulation and experiment. The first bending 
mode is similar to oscillating deformation and the largest 
displacement is gotten at the tail end. For the second bending 
mode, the deformation is similar to S-shape. The minimum 
deformation all happens at the position where the distance 
from the edge of the head is about one-third of body length. 
The calculated results on vibrational frequencies and bending 
modes are congruent to the experiments.

Then the transient analysis is carried out to determine the 
displacement response of the soft robot with a time-varying 
driving load in the fluid. There isn’t any fixed support on robot. 
The driving load from (1) in sine wave is applied to robot. The 
main propulsion mode of the soft robot is first bending mode 
and we mainly focus on it. The maximum deformation occurs 
at the caudal fin end. Thus, the displacement of the tail end is 
used to describe the deformation response of the soft robot. 
We adopt the results of 3Hz, where the robot has the good 
flexible fishlike movement due to suitable swimming number

displacement of the tail end in one cycle is presented in Fig. 5.

The special tested point shown in Fig. 5(a) is used to 
describe the displacement response in the current research. 
There is very similar displacement curve occurs in the 
simulation and experiment. The caudal fin makes the 
oscillating motion similar to a sine wave. The maximum 
displacement of the tail end is about 20mm. Compared with 
the experiment about 19mm, there is very small difference. As 
1476
  
a conclusion, the simulation coincides with experiment well. 
The method of FSI analysis is verified reasonable by the 
experiment, and efficient bending propulsion is realized 
successfully on prototype. The displacement response of the 
soft robot in the fluid is determined well through this method. 
The coupling method can be used to evaluate the vibration 
characteristics or propulsion modes of the soft robot in the 
fluid. It provides a way for further robot optimization on 
dynamic propulsion in the design of underwater soft robots. 
IV. STRUCTURE OPTIMIZATION 
Structure optimizations are carried out to improve the 
dynamic characteristics of the soft robot by coupling method. 
The propulsion with first bending mode is concerned. 
Keulegan-Carpenter number KC [27], also called the 
period number, is related with swimming speed V, tail beat 
frequency f and maximum lateral displacement of the caudal 
fin A. It can be expressed by KC=V/(fA), is equal to the 
reciprocal of the Strouhal number S
t
 in form. It is used for 
describing the relative importance of the drag force over 
inertial force for objects oscillating in a stationary fluid. For 
small KC, the inertia dominates, while the drag force is 
important for large KC. In order to develop a soft robotic fish 
with inertia type, we need to decrease the KC. Thus, the 
oscillating amplitude of the caudal fin, that is, the bending 
displacement of the tail end, should be increased when the 
frequency is decided. The tested point in Fig. 5(a) is also 
adopted for descripting the displacement of the tail end. The 
driving load of 3Hz in sine wave is applied for comparison. 
The caudal fin shape, head weight volume and body 
thickness of the soft fish robot play an important role in the 
movement [28], and they are optimized for improvement. The 
dashed lines in Fig. 6 describe the locations of the 
optimization on robot structure. The caudal fin shape is firstly 
presented, where the height of caudal peduncle and caudal fin 
are considered. At first, the height of caudal peduncle where 
the caudal fin connects to the fish body is optimized. The 
displacement of the tail end in one cycle is shown in Fig. 7(a). 
The caudal peduncle height is ranged from 3mm to 30mm. For 
different height, there are almost identical tracks similar to 
sine wave occur. The caudal peduncle height is in inverse 
proportion to the displacement of the caudal fin end. The 
maximum displacement about 48.3mm occurs when the 
caudal peduncle height is 3mm. It is greatly larger than the old 
robot with 20mm. The caudal peduncle height of 3mm is used 
for further optimization.

Then the caudal fin height is optimized in the range of 
15mm?30mm based on caudal peduncle height of 3mm. The 
displacement results of the tail end in one cycle are shown in 
Fig. 7(b). Due to the weakened stiffness, the deformation track 
has a little irregular when the height is 15mm. If the height is 
30mm, the displacement reaches the maximum value about 
52mm. The caudal fin height is proportional to the 
displacement of the tail end. The optimal height is 30mm.

Cylinder weight is placed on the head to constrain the head 
motion for larger displacement of the tail end. The 
optimizations of cylinder volume are carried out in the radius 
range of 1mm?7mm. Figure 9 presents the displacement of 
the tail end and head tip at different radii of the cylinder. There 
are almost identical curves happen at different volumes both 
on caudal fin end and head tip. The displacement difference 
among different volumes is small, especially on the head tip. 
The displacement of the tail end is proportional to the volume 
of the head cylinder. When the radius is 7mm, it obtains the 
maximum displacement. The radius of 7mm is optimal.

Finally, caudal peduncle height with 3mm, caudal fin 
height with 30mm, CFRP with 0.2mm thickness and radius of

robot for improvement. Figure 10 displays the new model.

The main body is also made by a CFRP plate and two MFC 
plates. Cylinder weight is also placed on the head to increase 
the displacement of the tail end. In the experiment, the 
blowing agent is also placed on the top to balance the robot 
weight. The type of the MFC is same to the old robot’s.

The bending deformation tracks of the new robot and old 
robot are shown in Fig. 11. Here we take the results of 3Hz as 
an example for comparison. The results in quarter of one cycle 
are presented due to the motion symmetry. The maximum 
deformation occurs at the tail end for both new and old robot, 
and the minimum deformation all happens at the position 
where the distance from the edge of the head is about one-third 
of body length. They have the similar first bending mode, but 
the new robot’s displacement is larger, meets the desired 
purpose for large displacement preliminarily. The KC of the 
new robot is smaller than the old robot. The inertia will 
dominate in its movement. The new soft robot has the better 
fishlike movement performance with larger deformation.

Figure 11.  Deformation track of the soft robot in quarter of one cycle 
Figure 12 describes the difference of the first bending 
mode at 3Hz for new soft robot between the simulation and 
experiment. The results in quarter of one cycle are presented. 
There is almost same bending mode exists in simulation and 
experiment. The efficient bending propulsion based on 
oscillating motion is realized by the coupling method. 
Furthermore, the vibrational frequencies of the new soft 
robot with a free boundary condition are shown in Table III. 
The first five mode frequencies are presented. Compared with 
the old robot, the vibrational frequencies of the new soft robot 
in the fluid are smaller due to the change in structure stiffness 
and weight. The first bending mode frequency is about 4Hz 
for new robot and 6Hz for old robot, and its maximum 
displacement occurs at the tail end. The second bending mode 
similar to S-shape is obtained at about 20.5Hz for new robot 
and 25Hz for old robot. If the frequency is 29Hz, the third 
bending mode occurs on new robot and we can get the 
maximum displacement at the head part. When the 
frequencies are about 11Hz and 37.9Hz, the first and second 
torsion deformation occur on the new robot, respectively.

In this research, we mainly concern bending deformation 
for oscillating or undulating movement. Therefore, the first 
three bending modes of the new robot are presented in Fig. 13.

Figure 13.  Vibrational modes of the new soft robot 
The simulation result of the new soft robot has the similar 
bending modes with the experiment at the corresponding 
mode frequencies. When the frequency of first bending mode 
is applied, the deformation is similar to oscillating propulsion.  
If the second and third bending modes occur, we can get the 
undulating propulsion. As a conclusion, the simulation results 
on bending propulsion modes about frequencies and mode 
shapes coincide with experimental results well and efficient 
bending propulsion is realized by the FSI coupling analysis. 
The swimming number S
w
 and Strouhal number S
t
 of the 
new soft robot at different bending propulsion modes are 
shown in Fig. 14. The S
w
 and S
t
 of the new soft robot are larger 
than the old robot both at the first and second bending 
propulsion mode. The S
w
 of the new robot is much close to 0.6 
1478
  
where the best flexibility and mobility happen compared with 
the old robot [26]. The S
t
 is generally in the range from 0.25 to 
0.4 for good fishlike movement performances. For the new 
soft robot, the S
t
 is about 0.4 for both bending propulsion 
modes. However, the old robot’s is less than 0.2 at the first 
bending mode. The new soft robot has the better propulsion 
performances similar to those of fishes, and the inertia 
dominates in the movement due to the smaller KC.

at different modes                     new robot at different frequenyies 
By focusing on the deformation modes of the new robot in 
the experiment, the swimming velocity at different 
frequencies from 1Hz to 30Hz can be obtained in Fig. 15. The 
similar velocity curve occurs on the new and old robot. 
However, the maximum swimming velocity of the new robot 
is larger than the old robot about 0.72m/s. The new soft robot 
can reach up to about 0.792m/s at 25Hz. 
V. CONCLUSION 
In this paper, the dynamic analysis of the soft robotic fish 
using PFC based on acoustics fluid-structural coupling 
method is performed to evaluate the dynamic vibration 
responses of the soft robot in the fluid. The effectiveness and 
reasonability of this coupling method are validated by 
comparing with experiment. Finally, a new soft robotic fish is 
presented by optimization. The efficient body bending 
propulsion based on oscillation or undulation is realized 
through the coupling method. The new soft robot has the 
better propulsion performances similar to those of fishes than 
the old robot. And the swimming velocity can reach 0.792m/s 
at 25Hz larger than the old robot. In future, improvement on 
propulsion performances of the new soft fish robot by 
coupling method will be done.
