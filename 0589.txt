Abstract—Flexible ureteroscopes are widely used for 
inspection, access, and manipulation in the ureter and kidney 
during uretero-renoscopy. However, existing endoscope designs 
rely on decades-old manual controls for translation, rotation, 
and tip flexion. The development of a more intuitive and 
user-friendly control system has the potential to greatly 
enhance the safety, efficacy, and efficiency of endoscopic 
procedures. Based on a first generation prototype, our lab 
designed an ergonomically enhanced flexible endoscopy robotic 
system. The system was designed to enable the surgeon to 
operate the endoscope through a low cost game controller. The 
kinematics were analyzed considering the nonlinearity of 
flexion driving and cable slack. The kinematics control was 
combined with the direct control for the system. The initial 
evaluations show the feasibility of this approach. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
Flexible endoscopy is commonly performed in all aspects 
of medicine including ureteroscopy, colonoscopy, etc. 
Uretero-renoscopy is used widely for stone removal, 
diagnosis for bleeding or malignancy, as well as direct biopsy 
and destruction of malignant lesions. In stone disease, 
ureteroscopy is becoming more widely used than the other 
minimally invasive means to remove stones in both adults 
and children [1]. However, existing endoscope designs are 
based on decades-old manual controls for translation, 
rotation and tip flexion. The ergonomics are poor, for 
instance, it can be hard to turn the control dials for surgeons 
who perform the procedure without an assistant [2]. Flexible 
endoscopes are not easy to stabilize [3] especially when the 
procedure requires holding the endoscope for a long time. 
Because of the complexity of movements needed for many 
applications, integration of a more intuitive and user-friendly 
control system has the potential to greatly enhance the safety, 
efficacy, and efficiency of these instruments.  
Robotic systems present a promising avenue to address 
the challenges in conventional endoscopy. In related work, 
researchers at Johns Hopkins developed robotic assistance for 
a flexible endolaryngoscope [4]. This robot was controlled by 
a SpaceNavigator 3D mouse (3D Connexion, Rochester, MI). 
We have also previously designed and fabricated a first 
generation prototype that is remotely controlled by a 3D 
mouse for robotically assisted ureteroscopy [5]. However,

these devices do not provide a fast mechanism for securing 
and removing the endoscope, thus, leading to a disrupted 
clinical workflow. Desai et al. have used the flexible Sensei 
robotic catheter system for renal calculi in 18 patients [6]. 
Other researchers developed a steerable robot driven by two 
remote motors through Bowden cables which is compact but 
its translation movement is manually controlled [7]. Guo has 
integrated force sensors to get force information from the tip 
of the catheter [8]. Chen has developed a motorized 
hand-held flexible rhino endoscope for ENT inspection [9]. 
The flexion and rotation of the endoscope is driven by motors 
but the translation is controlled by hand. Yoon has 
compensated for bending error by measuring the actual pose 
of the flexible endoscope [10].

The main contribution of this paper is in presenting a 
ureteroscopic robot which is ultimately intended for clinical 
use. As shown in Fig. 1, the robotic system makes it easy for a 
surgeon to snap-in and remove the ureteroscope in a sterile 
manner. Design objectives are presented with a 
comprehensive model of kinematics and the surgeon’s 
intuitive operating experience. The velocity control by 
combining kinematics and direct control mode is designed 
for the robot and some experiments are presented to test the 
performance of the robot. 
II. DESIGN SPECIFICATION 
A. Workflow 
The robotic system that we have designed is intended to 
enhance the existing workflow for ureteroscopy. In this 
workflow, the access to the renal pelvis is obtained manually 
following current clinical practice, since access is typically 
not difficult. Then, the ureteroscope is wrapped up in a sterile 
interface and snapped into the mechanical drive system, 
which will be located between the legs of the patient. From

this point, the physician will be able to manipulate the 
utereroscope using the control system described in this paper. 
B. Clinical Experiences and Requirements  
As a surgical device, in addition to feasibility, the 
ureteroscopic robot should also focus on usability, safety and 
ergonomic performance. We decided on the following design 
criteria for our prototype: (1) endoscopist can quickly and 
efficiently mount the endoscope on the robot; (2) the design 
should facilitate a sterile interface between the ureteroscope 
and the robot to prevent contamination; (3) the robot design 
should increase the stiffness of the flexible portion of the 
ureteroscope for improved maneuverability; (4) robotic motor 
cables should be routed properly to avoid tangling with the 
light and video cables, and prevent cable breaks due to robot 
motion; and (5) the robotic system is designed to work with 
existing commercial ureteroscopes. 
C. Mechanical Design 
The second generation prototype robot has three degrees 
of freedom as shown in Fig. 1. The ureteroscope used for this 
design is a Richard Wolf ureteroscope (Richard Wolf Medical 
Instrument Corp., Vernon Hills, IL, USA). The ureteroscope 
is mounted on the robot so that each motor independently 
manipulates rotation, flexion, and insertion (translation) of 
the ureteroscope. Three Maxon brushless motors (ECmax16 
8W) with encoders (MR 512 counts per turn) and three 
Maxon gear boxes (two GP22C 690:1 reduction ratio for the 
rotation and flexion and one GP22C 84:1 reduction ratio for 
translation) are used to drive the joints. Limit switches are 
installed for each joint as a safety measure to prevent 
excessive travel for each joint. The translation motion is 
realized by combining a ball screw and guide rails. 
 
Figure 2.  3D model of fast snap-on mechanism to secure the ureteroscope and 
mechanism to drive tip flexion. 
 The mounting mechanism is shown in Fig. 2. A sterile 
interface piece (bottom left of Fig. 1) is placed on the 
ureteroscope before it is mounted on the robot. One side of the 
sterile interface with a flat shaft is inserted into a hole in the 
drive shaft, which is fixed to the pulley B. Stainless wire with 
the diameter of 0.87 mm was used to transmit motion from 
the pulley A to the pulley B. The other side of the sterile 
interface is cone shaped and fixed in place by pushing tightly 
into a lock bar.  
Fig. 3 shows the fast snap-on mechanism to secure the 
ureteroscope. When the endoscopist presses the push button, 
lock teeth slide into the groove of the lock bar. Two snaps 
located on both sides of the lock bar secure the lock teeth in 
position. Thus, the ureteroscope is tightly fixed on the robot. 
The snaps are always open under the force of the bending 
springs. When the snaps are pushed in, pulling springs pull 
back the lock bar, thus releasing the sterile interface. This 
design makes it easy to install and uninstall the endoscope. 
 
Figure 3.  Detailed view of snap-on mechanism. 
 Since the ureteroscope consists of a long flexible cable 
that is inserted into the body, the part of the cable between the 
robot and the body may sag which is not desirable. Therefore, 
we created a rigid annular tube with higher stiffness to 
support the ureteroscope shaft during insertion. The length of 
the tube can be modified as needed to fit different endoscopes.  
 Because the light cable and vision cable of the 
ureteroscope are usually perpendicular to each other, these 
cables may become tangled with the motor cables when 
moving the rotation joint. This would happen frequently with 
the first generation prototype because in that design the motor 
and encoder cables from the robot are routed with the vision 
cable.  In the new design, all the motor and encoder cables are 
internally routed to avoid interference and terminated with 
two circular connectors at the bottom.

with three joints is used to support the robot. Table 1 contains 
some general specifications of the robot. Note that while the 
robot’s control dials for flexion only rotates about 45 degrees, 
this is mapped to the tip flexion of the scope of 270 degrees.  
III. KINEMATICS 
Fig. 4 depicts the tip of the ureteroscope. This end of the 
ureteroscope is mounted on the robot and is driven with three 
degrees of freedom. We denote the rotation of the 
ureteroscope about its axis by 
2
? , and translation by 
3
d . A 
bending knob on the remote proximal end is internally 
connected to a pair of opposing pull wires to actuate flexion of 
the ureteroscope tip as shown in Fig. 4 (b). The rotation of 
this bending knob is denoted by 
1
? . To formulate the 
expression for ureteroscope kinematics, we consider three 
frames of reference. The first frame of reference is a 
co-ordinate frame (X-Y-Z) fixed at the distal-most end of the 
ureteroscope that does not flex. The second frame of reference 
is a co-ordinate frame (x-y-z) fixed at the ureteroscope tip. 
The rotation and translation of the X-Y-Z co-ordinate axis is 
identical to that of the ureteroscope. To explain the flexion 
angle ?, we consider the point O of intersection of the tangent 
to the ureteroscope tip and the Y axis. The flexion angle is 
defined as the angle subtended by the flexion segment of the 
ureteroscope at the point O. The flexion angle ? is not equal 
to
1
? . Several kinematic strategies focused on positioning of 
flexible tool such as flexible instrument, and catheter have 
already been developed [11, 12]. We will use these techniques 
as the basis of our approach to control the ureteroscopic robot.  
 
Figure 4.  Actuated degrees of freedom and kinematic geometry of 
ureteroscope. (a) actuated degrees of freedom; (b) kinematic geometry 
A.  Ureteroscope Flexion 
Many studies have introduced the kinematics of flexible 
endoscopes or other instruments [13]. The kinematic model 
in this paper is based on combining the geometric principles 
and classic robot kinematics [14]. We derived closed-form 
kinematic solutions for the forward kinematics, inverse 
kinematics, and velocity analysis. Similar work has been 
done previously, however this work assumed that the catheter 
bends with a constant radius of curvature [11]. For 
ureteroscope, the radius of curvature of the flexion segment 
changes with the flexion angle ? . 
Moreover, the flexion toward clockwise and 
anticlockwise direction is not linear with respect to the first 
handle input 
1
? . Instead, the curve relating ? and 
1
? for the 
two directions are offset by a small amount as shown in Fig. 5. 
This is because of a “dead zone” due to slack in the pull wire 
strings and a lack of tension when the bending knob crosses 
the zero position. By estimating the curves relating the 
flexion angle ? and the bending knob angle 
1
? , we can 
compensate for the “dead zone” effect. This estimation also 
allows us to estimate the non-linear mechanism of the pull 
strings that actuate the flexion. One issue is that different 
flexible endoscopes may have different curves, so the system 
would need re-calibration before we use a new endoscope.

B.  Forward Kinematics 
As shown in Fig. 5, piecewise functions are used to 
estimate the two curves. Each section is fitted to a line. When 
the ureteroscope is bent toward anticlockwise direction, the 
flexion is divided into five segments.

IV. CONTROL 
A. Controller Architecture 
The architecture of the overall system is shown in Fig. 6. 
The robotic framework is interfaced to a computer through a 
Galil motion controller DMC-4133 (Galil Motion Control, 
Rocklin, CA, USA). The motion controller connects to a host 
computer by a USB or 100BASE-T Ethernet port. Four 750W 
servo drives are integrated on the Galil controller board. The 
Galil application programming interface is used to control 
the robotic framework. A low cost and light game controller 
serves as the user interface device and is also connected to the 
computer. This control framework allows the physician to 
more ergonomically control the ureteroscope while 
comfortably seated. The input from the user interface devices 
is converted into control signals by the interfacing software to 
5383
  
drive the robotic framework. This software included modules 
to evaluate the operative efficiency and accuracy of the robot 
system. The software was implemented as a dialog-based 
MFC application in Visual C++ on the Windows operating 
system. 
 
Figure 6.   Block diagram of overall system including controller 
B. Control Strategy 
Since the ureteroscope has just one bending DOF, it is 
very difficult to move the ureteroscope along an axis which is 
perpendicular with the bending plane. The condition number 
of the Jacobian matrix of the robot changes with the handle 
input 
1
? and 
2
? is shown in Fig. 7 [12]. The robot has a low 
kinematic performance when the first handle input 
1
? is 
around home position. For high efficiency, this condition 
must be avoided in the control strategy. 
 
Figure 7.  Condition number of the Jacobian matrix 
To design a high-efficiency control strategy, we use two 
control modes. The first control mode, referred to as the 
direct control (or joint to joint control) mode, is used when 
1
? is close to 0 degree. Each of three motions of the game 
controller is mapped to a robot joint motion without 
kinematics calculation. In the second control mode, referred 
to as the kinematics control, we use kinematics for velocity 
control of the ureteroscope when the joystick moves left, right, 
up and down. Two buttons on the joystick are responsible for 
backward and forward movement. The value of 
1
? is used to 
determine which control mode is used. The kinematics 
control flow diagram is show in Fig. 8. 
 
Figure 8.  Kinematics control flow diagram  
V. EXPERIMENT 
We carried out the following two experiments to evaluate 
the system performance: a) comparative bladder phantom 
experiment; and b) phantom kidney experiment.

procedure; (b) Robotic  operation in phantom kidney system. 
A. Comparative Bladder Phantom Experiment  
In this experiment, we compared manual and robotic 
ureteroscopy operation. The experimental setup is shown in 
Fig. 9. A bladder phantom with four colored spherical targets 
of 4mm diameter was used. The ureteroscope was 
maneuvered in a specific order to each of the targets. The task

of reaching the target was completed when the target color 
filled the visual field of the ureteroscope. A 6 
degrees-of-freedom electromagnetic sensor (Northern Digital, 
Waterloo, Canada) was inserted through the working channel 
to the ureteroscope tip for tracking purposes. The trajectories 
of the ureteroscope tip for the manual and robotic operation 
and the power spectral density diagrams are shown in Fig. 10.  
 
Figure 10.  The trajectory of the ureteroscope in robotic and manual operation. 
(a) is tip position on x axis separately. (b) is power spectral density diagram. 
Fig. 10 (a) shows the trajectories of the x co-ordinate of 
the ureteroscope tip for manual and robotic operation (the 
trajectories of the y and z co-ordinates are similar and not 
shown here). The total time for robotic operation was 362 
seconds while that for manual operation was 145 seconds. To 
evaluate the trajectories for the two operations, we carried out 
a frequency domain analysis. Fig. 10 (b) shows the power 
spectral density for the two trajectories. We see from these 
plots that the amount of power present in the zero frequency 
component for robotic operation is 86.18% while it is only 
47.31% for manual operation. Robotic operation is 
significantly smoother than manual operation and leads to a 
reduction in the non-zero component frequencies caused due 
to hand tremors and inexact maneuvers. However, the robotic 
operation needs more time than manual operation since in 
manual operation the ureteroscope can be moved quickly 
while the speed of the ureteroscope is limited on the robotic 
device.  This can be improved in future designs. 
B. Phantom Kidney Experiment  
As shown in Fig. 9 (b), we used the robotic system to 
maneuver the ureteroscope to two targets in a kidney 
phantom. This experiment simulates a realistic renal 
collecting system and ureter. Two colored wires were inserted 
as task targets in the kidney phantom. An external sheath was 
used to support the flexible portion of the ureteroscope. 
During the experiment, the operator was able to successfully 
maneuver the ureteroscope through different sections of the 
phantom to both the targets. The ureteroscope movement was 
found to be smooth as seen from the ureteroscope tip 
trajectory. Furthermore, the ureteroscope video output was 
stable due to absence of hand tremors and inexact maneuvers. 
VI. CONCLUSION 
In this paper a robotic system was designed to control a 
3-DOF flexible endoscope following the requirements 
developed by our clinical partners. The kinematics were 
analyzed considering the nonlinear flexion property and 
cable slack of the ureteroscope. To achieve more intuitive 
operation, the control combined kinematics and direct 
control mode. Initial experiments have shown the robot can 
smoothly and accurately drive the ureteroscope. The next step 
will be to go to animal tests and then pursue clinical trials.
