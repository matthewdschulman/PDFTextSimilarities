Revisiting Coverage Control in Nonconvex Environments using
Visibility Sets*
Lukas Klodt, Dominik Haumann and V olker Willert
Abstract— In the context of robotics coverage describes the
deployment of mobile sensors or agents in a target area.
This paper presents a new solution to coverage in noncon-
vex environments. We apply a modiﬁcation to the coverage
approach in [1], making use of visibility sets and a contraction
of the environment, leading to a change in the bounds of
integration. The resulting feedback control is fully distributed,
has guaranteed, inherent collision avoidance without separate
path planning and reduced communication and computation
requirements compared to similar approaches. We also formu-
late an extension to agents with limited sensing range. Our
method works in unknown environments, if all regions are of
equal interest. We provide simulation results demonstrating the
advantageous properties of the approach.
I. INTRODUCTION
The motion coordination of groups of autonomous vehi-
cles, mobile sensors or multi-robot systems is a challenging
and prevalent topic in the robotics community. The techno-
logic advancement of sensor nodes with mobility and net-
working capabilities opens up new application possibilities.
In most cases an important aspect is the distributed structure
of such systems, i.e., there is no centralized processing
station to coordinate the agents
1
. Instead, the mobile sensors
have to act autonomously relying only on local information
to ﬁnd a good solution to a common task [2]. This leads
to independence of a basis station and higher robustness
towards failing agents.
A. Introduction to Coverage
The considered task in this case is the optimal deployment
of mobile sensors in an environment: The sensors are placed
at possibly random locations in the target area and have to
spread out to reach a stable arrangement. Possible applica-
tions include distributed measurement, surveillance or search
and rescue missions.
A popular solution to this problem was presented in [1]
and is referred to as coverage control or Voronoi coverage.
The authors formulate the task as a geometric optimization
problem. This kind of resource allocation task was already
investigated in the context of information theory and vector
quantization [3] and for facility location problems [4] (e.g.,
where to place radio stations to cover an area as good as

capabilities.
possible). The resulting solution is a continuous-time version
of the Lloyd algorithm [3], which consists of the following
steps:
 Compute the V oronoi partition of the environment using
sensor positions as generators.
 Move all sensors towards the centroids of their respec-
tive V oronoi cells.
 Repeat until convergence is achieved.
This algorithm is formulated as a feedback control law that
allows distributed, adaptive and asynchronous minimization
of the optimization function. A lot of extensions to this
approach have been developed including: range limitations
[5], utilization of anisotropic sensors [6] and estimation of
importance of different areas [7]. The coverage framework
has also been modiﬁed to fulﬁll different tasks like target
tracking [8] and multi-robot exploration [9].
B. Literature on Coverage in Nonconvex Environments
The main drawback of V oronoi coverage is that it only
works in convex environments, which is a strong limitation
since real world environments are usually nonconvex. The
arising complications are already discussed in [10] with
several examples and can be summarized to two cases: The
centroid lies inside the environment but the trajectory crosses
through impassable regions, or the centroid lies outside the
environment. In both cases the robots would collide with
the environment and the ﬁnal conﬁguration is not clearly
deﬁned in the second case. These issues have been addressed
in several different ways in the literature. The existing
approaches are summarized in the following.
In [11], among other extensions, V oronoi coverage is
applied to simple polygons without holes using the gener-
alized gradient of the geodesic distance. The authors of [12]
propose a transformation for a class of nonconvex environ-
ments that allows the application of the coverage algorithm.
Mapping back to the original domain gives the solution to
the problem. The geometry and a suitable diffeomorphism
are assumed to be known beforehand. For a convex set
with obstacles the approach converges to the solution of the
original problem if it belongs to the interior [13], but in
other cases the solution can be suboptimal. Breitenmoser et
al. [10] show that for general nonconvex environments a path
planning procedure or obstacle avoidance is necessary. They
combine the Lloyd algorithm for target point calculation
with a local path planner and prove the convergence of
the proposed control strategy. The path planner constrains
outlying target points to the environment using a projec-
tion procedure. A combination of V oronoi coverage and a

potential ﬁeld method is presented in [14]. The approach
is a direct extension to the potential ﬁeld method from
[15], adding an additional attractive potential towards the
centroid of each robots V oronoi cell. The authors show that
their approach yields better ﬁnal conﬁgurations than [15]
in selected examples, but do not specify the case where a
centroid lies inside an obstacle and provide no theoretical
results towards convergence. In [16], Durham et al. propose
a coverage strategy on a discretized environment represented
by a graph. They deﬁne the generalized centroid as the
point inside a connected subset that minimizes the sum of
weighted distances to all other points. Due to the discretiza-
tion this point can be found with an exhaustive search or
an appropriate heuristic. The authors provide convergence
proofs under reduced communication requirements, i.e., only
pairwise communication is necessary.
The usage and maximization of visibility sets has been
studied extensively in the context of the art gallery problem.
Solutions to a distributed version of the art gallery problem
with mobile sensors have been developed and proven in [17],
[18]. The optimization goal is different compared to V oronoi
coverage even though it overlaps in some cases.
Also related to our work is the problem presented in [19].
The authors consider a modiﬁed coverage framework where
overlapping sensor areas increase the quality of coverage
and the environment with polygonal obstacles is no longer
partitioned into V oronoi cells. The common ground lies in
the approach that obstacles attenuate or block the sensing
abilities of the robots, leading to a closer analysis of the
gradient of the optimization function. The authors show that
the use of a generalized gradient is necessary due to a new
term that arises from the frontiers to invisible regions.
The combination of V oronoi coverage and limited visibil-
ity has only been considered recently by [20] and [21]. In
[20] a visibility-based V oronoi diagram is introduced and the
authors propose a projection of the centroid to the closest
point inside the visible V oronoi cell. A second algorithm
considers frontiers to invisible regions, towards which the
robots are directed to uncover new areas. The authors provide
simulations but no theoretical guarantees that the robots stay
inside the environment and converge to a stable conﬁgura-
tion. Marier et al. [21] also use the notion of a visible V oronoi
diagram similar to [20] with the difference that they allow
disconnected cells. The gradient of the optimization function
is analyzed leading to similar results as in [19]. A proof of
convergence is given for environments without holes. The
problem that agents might leave the environment is again
handled by a projection procedure.
C. Contribution of this paper
One of the main drawbacks of existing approaches is that
they have to rely on separate path planning or projection
procedures to ensure collision avoidance with the boundary
of the environment and obstacles. Additionally in some cases
they only work for certain types of environments.
We present a new approach based on [1] that consists
of a virtual growing of the environment and the use of
visibility sets. The resulting coverage strategy has inherent
collision avoidance properties without the use of explicit path
planning, obstacle avoidance behavior or projections into the
allowable area and works in arbitrary nonconvex environ-
ments. Additionally, our method has lower requirements on
communication and computation capabilities compared to
similar solutions. The advantageous properties of V oronoi
coverage are retained, i.e., the solution is distributed and the
agents can adapt to failing or new sensor nodes or changing
density functions. Furthermore, while we assume vehicles
with single integrator dynamics, the method can be extended
to other system dynamics following [22].
The next section begins with an introduction to notations
we use and the problem formulation, including the descrip-
tion of the coverage approach for convex environments.
Section III contains our extension to nonconvex domains
for unlimited as well as limited sensing range. Simulation
results and a discussion are presented in Section IV. The
last section completes this paper with a conclusion and an
outlook on future research.

sions, we limit our considerations to planar environments

of a set Q are written as @Q and int(Q), respectively.

be the V oronoi partition, withkk denoting the Euclidean
distance. According to this deﬁnition, the union of all cells
isQ and the interiors of any two distinct cells share no
common points. We refer to robots with adjoining V oronoi
cells as neighbors and assume ideal, bidirectional communi-
cation between neighbors. The graph consisting of all edges
between V oronoi neighbors is called Delaunay graph and is
dual to the V oronoi diagram. As in most other related work
we assume agents have omnidirectional vision and can locate
in a common coordinate frame.
B. Coverage Control
V oronoi coverage as presented in [1] originates from the
minimization of an objective function, dependent on the
conﬁguration P and a partition of the environment into
dominance regions assigned to each sensor. The authors show
that the optimal partition for the proposed setting is the
V oronoi diagram, using the positions p
i
as generators in
the way described above. This simpliﬁes the optimization
in that the objective function now only depends on the
conﬁguration:

with a positive gain k. In a convex environment all V oronoi
cells are convex [1] and therefore the centroid always lies
inside the corresponding cell. The solution converges to a
local minimum where the sensor positions coincide with the
centroids of their respective V oronoi cells and the resulting
partition is called centroidal V oronoi tesselation. The partial
derivative is distributed in the sense that each robot only
requires the location of its neighbors in the Delaunay graph
to compute the control input.
As suggested in the introduction the problem is now
that we want to transfer V oronoi coverage to nonconvex
environments.

tributed optimization similar to (4) and (1) such that all p

to a stable conﬁguration.
III. NONCONVEX COVERAGE
For all further considerations the environment is deﬁned
by a simple

polygonB and the set of simple polygonal
obstaclesO

the mobile sensors is consequentlyQ := Bn[
m
i=1
O
i
. A
vertex ofQ is convex, if its interior angle is less than or
equal to  radians, otherwise the vertex is concave.
The main aspect of our contribution consists of a combi-
nation of two modiﬁcations to the original problem in (1).
In conjunction with an approximation of the gradient, the
proposed approach leads to the desired behavior. The two
modiﬁcations are 1) the use of visibility sets and 2) the
application of a -contraction to the environment.

A simple polygon is non-self-intersecting and contains no holes.
A. Visibility
First, let us consider the notion of visibility. Given a set
QR
2
and a point p
i
2Q. A point q2Q is visible from
p
i
if the closed path segment [p
i
;q] =fp
i
+(q p
i
)j
2 [0; 1]g is contained inQ, i.e., [p
i
;q]Q. The set of all
pointsq2Q visible fromp
i
is the visibility set with respect
to p
i
, denoted asS
?
(p
i
). The visibility set is a star-shaped
domain and represents exactly the parts of the environment
that are visible from a robot location.
There are several reasons to use visibility sets in this
context. The ﬁrst one is the realistic consideration that sens-
ing capability may be attenuated or completely blocked by
obstacles. Using solely the Euclidean distance to characterize
sensing performance is no longer viable in the presence of
obstacles. Second, the use of visibility allows coverage to
be performed in unknown environments, assuming there are
no regions with higher priority. Otherwise, knowledge of the
density function is still necessary. The third reason is that
the limited visibility actually helps to provide a guarantee
that the robot stays inside the environment.
Following these thoughts it makes sense to deﬁne a new
V oronoi partition tailored to our visibility-limited setting.
One option is the usage of the geodesic distance as in [11]
and limiting the geodesic V oronoi cells to the visibility set.
Another option is the deﬁnition proposed in [20] and [21],
allowing points closer to one robot to be assigned to another
if they are invisible to the former.
Instead, we propose the use of a simpler, visibility-limited
V oronoi cell (VLVC)

g. This deﬁnition can be seen as a simple
intersection between the V oronoi cell and the visibility set
of each robot. Some regions that might be visible are
disregarded and treated as invisible, but the computation
and communication requirements are reduced compared to
other deﬁnitions (cf. Section IV-B). Range requirements for
communication remain the same as in convex environments,
i.e., communication is necessary between neighbors inV.

B. -contraction
The second modiﬁcation, as mentioned above, is the
application of a -contraction, also known as growing of
obstacles in robotics for collision-free path planning [23].
For an environmentQ, the-contraction is deﬁned asQ

equal to  (see Fig. 1).

ing: For arbitrary small  > 0 the boundary @Q

of the
-contraction is continuously differentiable in all q2 @Q

except in the convex vertices. All concave vertices grow by
, yielding a differentiable circular segment.

always be selected in a way thatQ

is also connected.
C. Derivation of the Objective Function
Given a nonconvex environment Q as deﬁned in the
beginning of this section, we propose to apply V oronoi
coverage to the-contraction of the environment in a limited
visibility setting. For this purpose we deﬁne the performance

controls the uncovering of such regions. Note that f

Taking a closer look at the boundary of a cellV

are four different parts to distinguish (see also Fig. 2):

Without the moving boundaries to invisible areas 

and

i0j
, the result in (9) would be equal to (2), i.e., the well-
known move to centroid behavior. The additional terms can
be interpreted as movement vectors that lead to revelation of
invisible areas, depending on the choice ofD. Higher values
of D result in a higher weighting of the additional terms
compared to the movement towards the center of mass of the
VLVC. Low values of D or disregarding the invisible area,
i.e., D = 0, would actually lead to robots actively reducing
visible area to minimizeH

Unfortunately, (9b) and (9c) require a high effort to
compute, lead to unwanted movements towards the boundary
ofQ in several cases and have negligible effect in many other
situations. Therefore we propose the following
Assumption 1 (Approximation of the gradient): The inte-
gral terms arising from the boundaries to invisible regions
in

have negligible effect on the desired coverage
behavior and the gradient can be approximated by

Depending on the situation this assumption can be quite
strong or very reasonable. We deliberately accept the fact
that there will be no active movement towards (uncovering

D. Trajectories
In this subsection we provide a statement about the
trajectories of the proposed system and some comments on
convergence.
Theorem 1 (Trajectories in nonconvex environments):
For a nonconvex polygonal environmentQ and an arbitrary
small  > 0, continuous application of (11) results in
trajectories of the conﬁguration P that never leave the
invariant setQ

.
Proof: First, pointing out the fact that in convex
locations the centroid ofV
?
;i
always lies in int(V
?
;i
) yields
the conclusion that collisions withQ

can only occur in
concave locations. Second, applying the -contraction toQ
turns all concave vertices in @Q into continuously differ-
entiable concave circular segments in @Q

. Approaching
concave locations q on the boundary @Q

the visibility-limited V oronoi cellV

the tangent in q and the centroid inevitably approaches
int(V


. Hence, no trajectory exists that leavesQ

.
The process of approaching a concave location is illustrated
in Fig. 3 in a scene with constant density. The circle
symbolizes the robot position and the red cross indicates the
centroid of the VLVC. After reaching an unstable equilibrium
in Fig. 3b, i.e., a point where the gradient is theoretically
zero, the robot moves to a stable location on either side
of the symmetrical scene, due to numerical inaccuracies. In
this context, another advantage of the-contraction becomes
clear: It offers guaranteed collision avoidance with the envi-
ronment by setting  to the physical radius of the robots.
Even though convergence to a stable centroidal conﬁg-
uration seems obvious, since all robots move towards the
centroids of their respective cells, a formal proof is still
missing.
E. Limited Sensing Range
In a realistic setting, alongside the attenuation of sensing
abilities through obstacles, sensors usually have a limited
sensing ranger, i.e., measurements beyondr are not accurate
enough or yield no results at all. This kind of approach is
related to the mixed distortion-area problem in [22], now
combined with our modiﬁcations from Sections III-A and

Similar to the unlimited case, (14) moves the robots to the
centroids of their respective visibility sets, herein limited
by radius r. Theorem 1 from Section III-D can be applied
analogously.
An additional advantage of this range limited setting
is a reduced requirement on the communication range. If
robots have distance kp

Instead, in a worst-case scenario with unlimited sensing
range, the communication range necessary is the diameter

IV. RESULTS
A. Simulations
In this section we demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach in a variety of simulated environments. The -
contraction has been applied to all scenarios with a value of
 = 0:15. Figures of scene A, B and C always illustrate the
ﬁnal, converged sensor positions and the trajectories leading
to these positions. As a ﬁrst example, Fig. 4 and 5 show the
comparison of a similar convex and nonconvex environment
of size 64 with the same starting conﬁguration of 5 sensors
in the top left corner, both cases with a uniform density
(q) = 1. In addition, Fig. 6 shows the progression of H
vis
corresponding to the trajectories in Fig. 5. Apparently, H
vis
is minimized despite our approximation.

Fig. 7 shows a coverage scenario with several obstacles

modiﬁed with a Gaussian density function shown in blue, is
covered by agents with a limited sensing range of r = 3 in
Fig. 8. The Gaussian function has a variance of

in both x- and y-direction with peak height 0:5 located in
the bottom right part of the environment.
A corridor-like region with constant density is considered
in Fig. 9, where sensors start in the far left part of the domain
and spread out all the way up to the right. The progression
of H
vis
in Fig. 10 shows that our approximated gradient

does not strictly minimize the original objective.
Nevertheless a good ﬁnal conﬁguration can be achieved.
In all our simulations, there was no situation where posi-
tions did not converge to a stable centroidal conﬁguration.
B. Discussion
As a ﬁnal assessment, the properties of our nonconvex
V oronoi coverage will be discussed and compared with
regard to optimality, computational effort and communica-
tion load. Computational effort and communication load are
important factors in a distributed environment, as evaluation
is done on the individual sensors, where both computation

as well as communication capabilities are limited.
One important point is the choice of partition. The com-
putation of the VLVC proposed in Section III-A is a simple
intersection operation, whereas other authors have to rely
on a discretization of the environment combined with a
ﬂooding method (e.g., [20]) for cell computation. Marier et
al. [21] use the same partition as presented in [20]. Another
additional effort is the treatment of disconnected cells, which
do not arise in our case. The partition also has an inﬂuence on
the required communication: Using the VLVCs, the sensors
only have to communicate their position to V oronoi neigh-
bors. Propagation of the visibility boundaries is not necessary
in our case, as opposed to the compared approaches. The gain
in optimality choosing the more complex partition remains
uncertain. Using the simpliﬁed notion of the visibility-limited
V oronoi diagram compared to [20] and [21] does not mean
agents do not see the area or can not sense there, but we
only disregard it in the computation of the control law.
The computation of the control input (11) is as simple
as in the original approach from [1] in known environ-
ments. In unknown environments, the -contraction has to
be computed online, but this case is rarely considered in
coverage literature. In [20], an additional path planning and
projection procedure is necessary at all times. Calculating
the control from [21] is even more costly, due to integrals
over the moving visibility frontiers and use of a generalized
gradient. Further, the parameter D has to be chosen and

adapted appropriately to the size of the environment.
Regarding optimality, reconsider the example in Fig. 3.
Optimizing H

exactly would always lead to convergence
to a minimum close to the position shown in Fig. 3b (pro-
vided an appropriate choice ofD), with trajectories possibly

temporarily. Using@H
approx;i
leads to an unstable
equilibrium and 2 stable local minima, one of which is shown
in Fig. 3c. This is a case where the approximated solution
can be relatively far away from the exact, in many other
situations the exact and approximated minimum locations
are closer together. Generally speaking, in scenes with high
nonconvexity and a low number of robots, the optimality is
reduced. On the other hand, especially in the case of limited
sensing range frontiers to invisible regions have a low impact
and the approximated solution is advantageous. Furthermore,
the optimization itself is nonconvex in all nontrivial cases,
even for convex environments, i.e., the conﬁguration con-
verges only to a local minimum with a gradient method. Still,
the exact method from [21] has the advantage with respect
to optimality. The results of the discussion are summarized
in Table I, showing a comparison to the two closely related
approaches.
V. CONCLUSIONS
We successfully transferred V oronoi coverage to noncon-
vex environments, proposing an approximating solution that
has advantageous properties with regard to communication
and computation requirements and obstacle avoidance behav-
ior. An extended comparison of approximated solutions with
the exact solutions to the objective function could lead to
more interesting insights into the properties of our method.
Future work could also include a more detailed look into
different kinds of partitions on visibility sets and, as already
mentioned, a formal proof of convergence is also open for
future research.
