AbstractÑThis article presents an approach and a systematic 
design methodology to path following control based on motion 
decoupling for high-performance ducted fan unmanned aerial 
vehicles (UAVs). The decoupling is performed according to the 
principle of regarding the attitude motion as a virtual input of 
the lateral longitudinal flight dynamics. This allows the attitude 
and flight controllers to be designed individually without mutual 
interference. Considering that dynamics of the ducted fan UAV 
is uncertain, an estimation method of system function based on 
the smooth saturation function and the state variable integral is 
proposed. This method has the advantage of less computation 
while keeping the high estimation performance. The stability 
analysis and the simulation results showing the practical 
feasibility of the proposed control scheme to ducted fan UAVs 
are given. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
The ducted fan UAV has gained increasing interest among 
professional researchers for its high propulsion efficiency [1]. 
To avoid the adverse effects of the gyroscopic couplings, the 
coaxial dual-propellers and the control surface having a large 
lift-to-drag ratio are used in the actuate system design. These 
characteristics show that the ducted fan UAV possesses a 
great potential in the high-altitude surveillance.  
The ducted fan UAV is a nonlinear under-actuated system, 
the attitude and flight dynamics of which share the control 
inputs generated by the control surfaces and highly couple 
with each other. The technique of the dynamic-inversion plays 
an important role in dealing with the control framework of this 
kind of system [2]?[4]. Original system dynamic equation is 
transformed into a linear equation via feedback linearization, 
so as to simplify the controller design. However, an accurate 
modeling for the ducted fan UAV is necessary for the dynamic 
inversion control.  
Recently, the issue of enhancing the system robustness has 
come into focus, among which, the theories on neural network 
and robust adaptive control have been successfully applied to 
the technique of the ducted fan UAV and have been verified to 
be reliable and efficient in overcoming the adverse effects of 
the unknown disturbances including the modeling errors

[5]?[8]. However, the relatively large amount of calculation 
is needed to update the weight coefficients of the activation 
functions for neural-network-based intelligent controllers. As 
regards adaptive controllers, the estimation process of every 
system parameter highly relies on the structural information of 
the system function.

This article presents a novel decoupling control framework 
for the path following of ducted fan UAVs. The behaviors of 
flight and attitude dynamics are decoupled well by proposing 
the following design procedures: 1) constructs the pseudo 
control inputs in the lateral and longitudinal flight dynamics; 2) 
imports their values into an attitude command generator, 
which is designed by using the inverse kinematics of ducted 
fan UAV; 3) designs a controller for the attitude command 
tracking, which generates an attitude matching with the path 
following. This decoupling approach enables the ducted fan 
UAV to follow the desired path well by the attitude-guidance, 
even though the ducted fan UAV turns about its yaw axis.  
Given the dynamics of the ducted fan UAV is uncertain, in 
the controller design, an estimation approach of the system 
function is proposed based on the state variable integral and 
the smooth saturation function. This approach differs from the 
schemes mentioned previously in that the system function is 
considered as a disturbance composed of the low and high 
frequency components, whose values are easy to be estimated 
by the adaptive adjustments for the integral gain and for the 
weight coefficient of the saturation function. Therefore, both a 
high efficiency in the algorithm calculations and the correct 
compensation on the unknown disturbance are realized.  
The remainder of this article is organized as follows. The 
dynamics of ducted fan UAV is described in Section II. The 
design scheme of the proposed controller and its associated 
stability analysis are discussed in Section III and Section IV. 
Simulation results are described in Section V to illustrate the 
proposed concept. Section V contains concluding remarks.

II. MODELING 
A. Kinematics 
Two reference frames are considered to describe dynamics 
of ducted fan UAV: ? is an inertial frame attached to the earth 
and A is a body-fixed frame attached to the center of mass of 
ducted fan UAV. The position of center of mass of ducted fan 
UAV with respect to I and the angular velocity of ducted fan 
UAV with respect to A are expressed as ? =[ x y z ]
T
 and 
½ =[
x
? 
y
? 
z
? ]
T
, respectively. The attitude 
ij
r ?? ? R ( i =1, 
2, 3, j =1, 2, 3) of A with respect to I is represented by 
means of the Euler angles: ? =[? ? ? ]
T
  (? : pitch angle, 
? : roll angle, ? : yaw angle). 
The relation between ½ and ? is given as follows: 
 
½ = Q?                                    (1)

mass and inertia matrices, respectively.

where D and C are the inertial and coupling matrices of the 
attitude dynamics (3?2).   
III. DECOUPLING CONTROL FRAMEWORK 
Given that the elements in 
u
T =
-1
c
QT are the independent 
control variables (Q is nonsingular in the neighborhood of the 
upright equilibrium point ? =? ? 0), the local control for the 
attitude may ensure system stability [7]. However, in the case 
of the path following, we cannot avoid a problem that the 
attitude dynamics and the flight dynamics share the control 
inputs arising from the control surface motions and highly 
couple with each other. This section introduces a decoupling 
control framework based on an attitude-guidance.  
A. Analysis of Flight dynamics 
The flight dynamics (3?1) can be reformulated as 
 
13 x t x

where

It is now clear that the propeller thrust 
t
f itself does not 
participate in the control of the lateral and longitudinal flight 
dynamics, but it is a Òlarge amplification coefficientÓ for the 
attitude-dependent inputs 
13
r and 
23
r . Thus the behaviors of 
the attitude dynamics are considered as the inputs of the lateral 
and longitudinal flight dynamics. By contrast, the dynamics 
along the vertical direction is governed directly by the input 
variable 
33 zt
u f r ? . 
B. Design of Attitude Command Generator 
First, we introduce the desired attitude-dependent inputs 
d
r
13
 and 
d
r
23
, and the pseudo control inputs of the lateral and 
longitudinal flight dynamics 
x
r
u and 
y
r
u , such that

where 
t

f is the nominal value of the propeller thrust 
t

Meanwhile, let them satisfy the following relations:

where 
d

d

d

obtain

Given that the first and second derivatives of 
d
? and 
d

unmeasurable, a third order filter, ? ?

1 H s s a ? ? ? , is 
considered in the following modification process:

? ?

Hs ?? ?                             (8?2) 
 
where s is the Laplace variable, and a is the positive design 
parameter, which is chosen as the large value to reduce the 
delay-time of the filter.   
Remark 1: When the error between 
t
ö
f and 
t
f is small and 
the performance in the attitude commands tracking is ensured 
to be high trough the control torque T
u
, we have ? ? ? ? ?
r d

? ? ? ? ?
r d

u ? , and 0
y
u ? . In this situation, 
the lateral and longitudinal flight dynamics are represented as 
x
xr
mx u ? ?? and 
y
yr
my u ? ?? , respectively. This shows that 
the attitude dynamics and the lateral and longitudinal flight 
dynamics can be governed by the control torque T
u
 and the 
pseudo control inputs 
x
r
u and 
y
r
u , respectively. 
IV. ROBUST ADAPTIVE CONTROL DESIGN 
As previously mentioned, the theories on robust adaptive 
control and neural network control are reliable and efficient in 
the compensation of the unknown disturbances, but theses 
schemes cause a relatively complex algorithm structure. This 
section presents a compensation method based on the system 
function approximation. 
A. System Function Approximation 
Given the desired paths 
d
? =[
d
x 
d
y 
d
z ]
T
 and the attitude 
commands 
d
? =[
r
? 
r
? 
d

T
, the corresponding tracking 
errors are 
1
e =
d
? -? and 
2
e =
r
? -? , as well as the filtered 
tracking errors are

where 0 ?
1
? and 0 ?
2

The flight dynamics (4) and the attitude dynamics (3?2) can 
then be written in terms of the filtered tracking errors as 
 
?
M? =

Assumption: In the Equation (9), the each element of the 
system function vectors,

and high frequency components and restricted to the following 
compact sets:

where

?
? =[

T
. This hypothesis is acceptable because the ducted fan 
UAV is a real physical system and each physical element in 
the system function vectors 
?
? and 
?
? itself contains the low 
and high frequency components.  
It is easy to check from (10) that, for each time t, () t
?
? and 
() t
?
? are bounded by [8] 
 
j

Consequently, the sets of the allowable initial filtered tracking 
errors are represented as follows:

Given that 
?
? and 
?

j

and 
r
j
S
?
? ? , there exists the three-dimensional weight vectors, 
j

 and ?? ? ? is the smooth saturation function defined by 
() ? ?? = ) 1 ( ) 1 (

with a positive design parameter ? and a argument ? .  
Remark 2: We incorporated the uncertain disturbances 
?
d
F 
and 
d
T into the system functions ?
1
 and ?
2
, respectively, and 
considered these system functions as the functions composed 
of the low frequency components (?
j
) and the high frequency 
components (?
j
W
j
). This modeling approach is beneficial for 
the simplification of the algorithm structure of controller. 
B. Tuning Algorithm 
   From above analysis, the control law can be written as   
 
u

respectively; and

From (13) and (14), the filtered tracking error dynamics is 
reformulated as

Lemma: Assume

by

Fig. 2 illustrates the ability of the proposed decoupling 
control framework to coordinate the mutual interference 
between the attitude dynamics and the flight dynamics in the 
process of the path following. The ducted fan UAV exactly 
follows the desired path (left figure) by the attitude control 
(right figure), even though the strong nonlinear couplings and 
aerodynamic interferences exist.  
Fig. 3 compares the real system functions 
1
? and 
2
? (solid 
lines) with their estimations 
1
ö
? and 
2
ö
? (dashed black lines) 
computed by using the tuning algorithm (17). The fast and 
correct convergences demonstrate that our proposed approach 
is effective to attenuate the adverse effects of the unknown 
external disturbances.  
The results of the path following control and the attitude 
command tracking under the circle motion are shown in the 
Fig. 4. Despite the change in the operating condition, the 
ducted fan UAV tracks the desired path (left figure) well by 
the attitude adjustment (right figure).  
VI. CONCLUSION 
We have established a mapping model between the attitude 
commands and the pseudo control inputs of the lateral and 
longitudinal flight dynamics to realize an attitude-guided path 
following control. Advantage of this modeling approach lies 
in its coordination function that allows the attitude controller 
and the flight controller to be designed individually without 
mutual interference and enables the ducted fan UAV to track 
the desired path well under the presence of the yaw motion. A 
system function (disturbance) estimation method based on the 
state variable integral and the smooth saturation function has 
been proposed to simplify the control algorithm structure, and 
the less performance degradation of the controller, under the 
presence of the unknown disturbances, have been obtained. 
Uniform ultimate boundedness of the closed-loop dynamics of 
ducted fan UAV has been proved and demonstrated via the 
numerical simulations.  
Future works are summarized as follows: the performance 
in the path following control is limited when the rate of 
variation of the position commands become larger. Therefore, 
the further research for enlarging the bandwidth of the pseudo 
control of the lateral and longitudinal flight dynamics should 
be done. Furthermore, the comparison and the analysis of the 
several control technologies including adaptive control and 
neural-network-based intelligent control are also important 
for future work.
