Abstract— Robotic systems have the potential to assist vitre-
oretinal surgeons in extremely difﬁcult surgical tasks inside
the human eye. In addition to reducing hand tremor and
improving tool positioning, a robotic assistant can provide
assistive motion guidance using virtual ﬁxtures, and incorporate
real-time feedback from intraocular force sensing ophthalmic
instruments to present tissue manipulation forces, that are
otherwise physically imperceptible to the surgeon. This paper
presents the design of an FBG-based, multi-function instrument
that is capable of measuring mN-level forces at the instrument
tip located inside the eye, and also the sclera contact loca-
tion on the instrument shaft and the corresponding contact
force. The given information is used to augment cooperatively
controlled robot behavior with variable admittance control.
This effectively creates an adaptive remote center-of-motion
(RCM) constraint to minimize eye motion, but also allows
the translation of the RCM location if the instrument is not
near the retina. In addition, it provides force scaling for sclera
force feedback. The calibration and validation of the multi-
function force sensing instrument are presented, along with
demonstration and performance assessment of the variable
admittance robot control on an eye phantom.
I. INTRODUCTION
Retinal microsurgery refers to the intraocular surgical
treatments of the disorders related to retina, vitreous, and
macula. Typical diseases include retina detachment, diabetic
retinopathy, macular hole and epiretinal membrane. Reti-
nal microsurgery demands advanced surgical skills that are
near or beyond natural human capabilities. During retinal
microsurgery, a surgical microscope is placed above the
patient to provide magniﬁed visualization of the interior
of the eye. The surgeon inserts small instruments (e.g.,
25 Ga) through trocars on the sclera, the white part of the
eye, to perform delicate tissue manipulation in the posterior
of the eye. An example of a common surgical task is
epiretinal membrane (ERM) peeling to restore the patient’s
vision from ERM distortion. The surgeon carefully peels
the thin, semi-transparent scar tissue (the ERM) off the

retina using a micro-forceps, as shown in Fig. 1. A more
challenging maneuver is internal limiting membrane (ILM)
peeling, where the innermost layer of the neurosensory retina
is incised a few microns, and delaminated from the rest of
the retina. Steady and precise motion is desired, because the
thickness of the membranes [1] can be an order of magnitude
smaller than the human hand tremor [2]. Additionally the
force applied on the membrane has to stay below the strength
of the retina tissue. However, the forces exerted between
the instrument tip and the retina are well below the human
sensory threshold [3]. The absence of force sensing raises
the risk of applying excessive force on the retina, which
can potentially cause retina hemorrhage and tearing. During
the membrane peeling, the eye should be stable to minimize
the motion of the target membrane. This requires the tool
motion to comply at the sclerotomy site. Only three rotational
degrees of freedom (DOF) about the sclera entry point
and one translational DOF along the instrument axis are
allowed, while lateral translations are prohibited by the sclera
constraint. This corresponds to the concept of remote center-
of-motion (RCM) in robotics, devised by Taylor et al. [4].
A ﬁxed RCM is often considered to be a fundamental
requirement in minimally invasive Surgery (MIS). Unlike
MIS, the imaging component of retinal microsurgery, the
microscope, is located outside the patient and is rarely
moved, as shown in Fig. 1(a). Instead, the retinal surgeon
needs to reposition the patient’s eye using the inserted tools,
in order to adjust the view and gain tool access to the
region of interest. As a result, the location of the RCM
point (the sclera entry point) is not necessarily ﬁxed, and
can move up to 12 mm during retinal microsurgery [5].
The repositioning of the eye requires all of the instruments
inserted in the eye (e.g., a micro-forceps and a light pipe)
to move in coordination. Unsynchronized instrument motion
can cause cornea striae, which distorts the view of the
retina in the microscope. Suboptimal ergonomics and fatigue
impose further limitations on the surgical performance.
Many robotic systems have been developed and investi-
gated to explore the potential to enhance and expand the
capabilities of retinal surgery and microsurgery in general.
Major approaches include master-slave teleoperated system
[6]–[9], handheld robotic devices [10], [11], and untethered
micro-robots [12]. Our approach is the Steady-Hand Eye
Robot with hands-on cooperative control [13]–[16], where
the user and the robot both hold the surgical instrument. The
user input force applied on the instrument handle controls
the velocity with which the robot follows the user motion.

This control approach is also termed admittance velocity
control. The human hand tremor is damped by the stiff robot
structure. The cooperatively controlled robot provides not
only the precision and sensitivity of a machine, but also
the manipulative transparency and immediacy of hand-held
instruments. This robotic system can further be augmented
with virtual ﬁxtures [17], as well as incorporated with smart
instruments with various sensing modalities.
Virtual ﬁxtures are algorithms that provide assistive mo-
tion guidance with anisotropic robot behavior. The robot
motion constraints assist the user to avoid forbidden regions
[17], [18], as well as to guide along desired paths [19], [20].
Virtual ﬁxtures can be prescribed [17], [18], generated from
patient anatomy [21] or from real-time computer vision [19].
The implementation includes impedance [18] and admittance
methods [19], [20], as well as optimization algorithms with
desired geometric constraints [21], [22]. With the aid of
virtual ﬁxtures, the mental and physical demands on the
user to accomplish a desired maneuver are reduced, while
the task performance is notably increased. The surgeon can
concentrate on the critical surgical tasks (e.g., membrane
peeling) if virtual ﬁxtures can manage the inherent surgical
motion constraints, such as RCM and tool coordination, by
providing an intuitive, guided robot behavior.
Smart instruments with force sensing capability are essen-
tial for safe interaction between the robot and the patient.
Various force sensors have been developed for microsurgery,
micromanipulation, and MIS [23]–[27]. Handle mounted
force sensors [28] cannot distinguish forces exerted at the
tool tip from those at the trocar. Therefore, a family of
force sensing instruments [29]–[32] has been developed with
ﬁber optic sensors integrated into the distal portion of the
instrument that is typically located inside the eye. Auditory
[33] and haptic [34] force feedbacks have demonstrated
the efﬁcacy of regulating the tool-to-tissue interaction force.
During a freehand manipulation, the surgeon can often sense
the contact force at the sclera entry point, and utilizes it
as an important indicator to guide the desired motion, e.g.,
RCM and tool coordination. However, the stiffness of the
Steady-Hand Eye Robot attenuates the user perceptible level
of the sclera force, inducing undesired large sclera forces.
We devised a dual force sensing instrument [35] to provide
force feedback from both tool tip force and sclera force. The
drawback is that the force sensor cannot provide the exact
sclera force value nor the location where the sclera force is
applied on the tool shaft. Instead, it measures the moment
attributed to the sclera force.
In this paper, we report a new design of a multi-function
force sensing instrument that can sense not only the sclera
force in transverse directions, but also the location of the
sclera contact point on the tool shaft. This new multi-function
force sensing instrument enables a variable admittance robot
control to provide an intuitive robot behavior. By varying
the robot admittance, the robot behavior can continuously
transit from an adaptive virtual ﬁxture mode that enforces
RCM and adapts to the current location of the sclerotomy
site, to a force scaling mode that provides scaled feedback
of the sclera force as well as the ability to reposition the
eye. Experiments are conducted to calibrate the new multi-
function force sensing instrument, to calibrate the tool tip
position with respect to the robot, and to evaluate the force
sensor as well as the proposed robot control algorithm.
Preliminary results show the potential to increase safety, as
well as to enhance the usability and capability of the robotic
assistant system.
II. MULTI-FUNCTION FORCE SENSING TOOL
A. Design
The new design improves on the previous dual force
sensing instrument [35]. Based on the observation of the
surgical procedure, it is assumed that forces are only exerted
at no more than two locations: the tool tip and the sclera
contact point on the tool shaft. The tool shaft is made of a
stainless steel wire with a diameter of 0.5 mm, same as the
25 Ga ophthalmic instrument. The tool shaft is machined
to cut three longitudinal channels with V-shape sections.
One optical ﬁber with three ﬁber Bragg grating (FBG)
sensors (Technica S.A., Beijing, China) is embedded into
each channel in the tool shaft. Each FBG sensor is 3 mm
long. The tool dimension, as well as the speciﬁcations of the
FBG sensors are shown in Fig. 2.
The new multi-function force sensing instrument includes
nine FBG sensors in total, arranged into three segments of
the tool shaft. The three FBG sensors in the same tool shaft
segment are 120

apart, and provide strain measurements at
that segment of the tool shaft. The ﬁrst FBG sensing segment,
FBG-I, typically remains inside the eye. It is used to measure
the transverse force exerted between the tool tip and the eye
tissue, because the sclera contact force does not generate
strain at the tool tip. FBG-II and FBG-III sensing segments
are at least 30 mm proximal from the tool tip, greater than
the average diameter of the human eye (25 mm). They are
dedicated to measure the transverse force exerted at the
sclerotomy, and the location of the sclerotomy with respect
to the tool. The axial force component at the sclerotomy is
mainly due to friction, thus is correlated to the transverse
force, i.e., normal force. Axial force sensing at the tip is
not included in this prototype, but is possible as shown in
our other work [32]. The total length of the tool shaft is
45 mm. The data acquisition unit is the sm130-700 optical
sensing interrogator from Micron Optics (Atlanta, GA) with

a refresh rate of 2 kHz and a spectrum range from 1525 nm
to 1565 nm.
B. Algorithm to Calculate Forces and Sclerotomy Location
The algorithm to calculate the tool tip and sclera forces
is based on the previous methods presented by Iordachita
et al. [29] and He et al. [35]. The wavelength shift common
mode of the FBG sensors from the same sensing segment
represents the strain attributed to axial force and temperature
change. The differential mode, termed sensor reading, is
deﬁned as follows:

ing and the wavelength shift of FBG sensor k in sensing
segment j, with j= I, II, and III, and k = 1, 2, and 3.
With the assumption that tool-to-tissue interaction forces
are always exerted at the tool tip, the sensor readings of
FBG-I are linearly dependent on the transverse force at the
tool tip:

The location where the sclera contact force is exerted on
the tool shaft depends on the tool insertion depth inside the
eye. Together with the sclera contact force, it contributes to
the strain generated at FBG-II and FBG-III. In addition, the
FBG sensors also respond to tool tip force, therefore:

This method can calculate transverse forces exerted at the
tool tip and at the sclerotomy, as well as the location of the
sclerotomy with respect to the tool. However, if the magni-
tude of the sclera contact force is small, the location of the
sclerotomy calculated using (9) can be subject to large error.
Therefore, the sclerotomy location is updated with the help
of a dead band on the sclera force magnitude. Only when
the sclera force magnitude exceeds a given threshold (e.g.,
5 mN), the sclerotomy location will be updated using (9),
otherwise the previous value of d
j
will be used.
III. VARIABLE ADMITTANCE ROBOT CONTROL
A variable admittance robot control scheme is devised
from previous force scaling and admittance velocity control
[34], [36]. In addition to the surgeon’s force input at the
tool handle (robot end-effector), it utilizes the new sensing
capabilities enabled by the multi-function force sensing
instrument, to provide a robot behavior that is transparent
and intuitive to the surgeon. This robot behavior enables
useful feedbacks and virtual ﬁxtures to increase precision
and safety to interact with the patient and the environment.
Fig. 3 illustrates the variable admittance control scheme.

that is allowed by the RCM constraints. In addition, the sclera
force feedback is to servo the sclera contact force toward
zero. This strengthens the virtual RCM with robustness
against eye motion attributed other instrument and patient
movement.
When the surgeon is performing membrane peeling, the
tool tip is close to the retina, and an RCM is desired to
minimize the motion of the eye and the target membrane.
When the surgeon needs to reposition the eye to adjust view,
the tool is kept away from the retina to avoid collision.
Therefore, the measured insertion depth of the tool can be
used to adjust the robot admittance to provide the appropriate
robot behavior. For example, we can deﬁne:

IV. EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS
A. Calibration of the Multi-Function Force Sensing Tool
An automated calibration system [32] is used to carry out
the calibration. The orientation and position of the tool are
controlled by a high precision robot (translation resolution
1 m, rotation resolution 0.005

). Actual values of the
transverse forces are measured by a precision scale with a
resolution of 1 mg.
1) Calibration for Tool Tip Force: The calibration for tool
tip force is the same as for our previous dual force sensing
tool [35]. Transverse forces up to 10 mN are applied along
X- and Y-axes. The coefﬁcient matrices K

III, are obtained as least squares solutions of (2) and (3)

Transverse forces are applied at 16 locations on the tool
shaft, from 10 mm to 25 mm proximal from the tool tip
with 1 mm intervals, shown as d
s
in Fig. 2(c). The force
magnitude ranges from 25 mN at 10 mm from the tool tip,
to 100 mN at 25 mm from the tool tip. Because the optical
ﬁbers are manually aligned and embedded into the tool shaft,
the accurate “center” locations of FBG-II and FBG-III, i.e.,
l
II
and l
III
in Fig. 2(c), are not known. There is no force

the more accurate is the location estimation. As shown in
the next section, Low pass ﬁltering can further reduce the
sensing noise and smooth the estimation.
Using the sclera calibration results, we examine the tool
tip force cancellation from FBG-II and FBG-III. The sensor
readings of FBG-II and FBG-III from calibration with only
tool tip forces are plugged into (7) and (8) to calculate the
sclera force estimation error due to tool tip force. As shown
in Fig. 9, the sclera force errors are not dependent on the
tool tip force magnitude, and are possibly due to the system
noise. The RMS errors are 0.62 mN for F
sx
and 0.74 mN
for F
sy
, with tool tip forces up to 10 mN.

the scleratomy is located from the tool tip, i.e., the closer it is with respect

forces smaller than 5 mN in magnitude is not included to reduce noise, as
discussed in Section II-B.

of the transverse forces, as well as the location on the tool
shaft where the force is applied are generated randomly
within the calibrated range. A moving average ﬁlter with
a window size of 100 samples is applied on the location
estimation of sclerotomy. Fig. 10 illustrates the results of
the validation experiment. The RMS errors of F
sx
and
F
sy
estimations are 0.56 mN and 1.08 mN respectively.
The RMS error of the sclerotomy location estimation is
0.57 mm, comparable to the lowest RMS error obtained in
the calibration (at 25 mm from the tool tip).
B. Tool-to-Robot Calibration
Incorporating the multi-function force sensing capability
into the robot control requires an accurate coordinate trans-
formation from the local tool frame to the robot handle
frame. It is reasonable to assume the tool and the robot
handle are coaxial. The X- and Y-axes of the tool and the
robot handle are manually aligned. The Z-offset z
ht
from
the tool tip to the robot handle is about -40 mm measured
with a caliper. A traditional pivot calibration is not practical,
because the tool shaft is not rigid. We use variable admittance
control to enforce the RCM constraint, in order to perform
a pseudo pivot calibration. Fig. 11 illustrates the experiment
setup. A piece of 0.25 mm thick, stiff paper is taped to a CD
clamped to a stable platform. A 0.7 mm hole is punctured in
the center of the paper that is exposed through the center hole
of the CD. The multi-function force sensing tool is inserted
through the hole and pivoted with the RCM constraint by
the variable admittance control, as shown in Fig. 11(a).

The corresponding trajectories of the RCM point and the tool

computed RCM positions is 0.38 mm, 0.34 mm and 0.74 mm
in the X-, Y-, and Z-direction, respectively. This demonstrates
the capability of adaptive RCM constraints enabled by the
variable admittance control.
C. Tracing a Retina Vein in an Eye Phantom with Robot
Assistance
We further assess the performance of the robot control
methods using an eye phantom, as shown in Fig. 13. The
tool is mounted in the tool holder of the Steady-Hand Eye
Robot and inserted through a 23 Ga trocar on the eye. The
tracing task is to make a round trip with the tool tip above a
retina vein branch that is about 3 mm long. A stereo video
microscope with a 3D display is used for visualization.
Five trials are conducted with the variable admittance
robot control. Fig. 14 illustrates the recorded sclera forces, as

well as the trajectories of the sclerotomy point and the tool
tip of one trial. The maximum sclera force magnitude is 3.44
 0.21 mN. The sclerotomy position is calculated using the
tool-to-robot transformation obtained in Section IV-B. The
standard deviation of the sclerotomy position is 0.13 0.03
mm, 0.17 0.06 mm, and 0.38 0.06 mm for X-, Y-, and
Z-direction. The experiment results show the RCM behavior
with the variable admittance control is precise and repeatable,
minimizing both force and motion of the sclerotomy.
Same task is also attempted with the standard cooperative
robot control without sclera force feedback. However, no
successful trial was completed. The robot stiffness attenuates
the user perceptible level of the sclera force. The excessive
tool deﬂection due to large sclera forces (over 50mN) and
the inverted tool motion due to RCM make it very difﬁcult
for the user to precisely control the tool tip trajectory. As a
result, the pivot motion of the tool and the sclerotomy point
are misaligned. In contrast, the variable admittance control
enables a fulcrum at the sclerotomy, the user pivots naturally
about it with precise control of the tool tip motion.
V. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
Krupa et al. [37] used force control with the help of a
force sensor mounted on the robot end-effector to implement
an adaptive RCM behavior. However, it was assumed that
there is no transverse forces exerted at the instrument tip,
therefore the transverse forces measured outside the patient
at the robot end-effector is the contact force exerted between
the instrument shaft and the trocar. This assumption is not
necessary valid in MIS. The multi-function force sensing

instrument can provide sufﬁciently accurate, independent
measurements of the tool tip force and the sclera contact
force, as well as the location of the sclerotomy. Its design
can also be applied to surgical instruments for MIS, to
provide additional useful information to improve the surgical
robot control. Both impedance and admittance type robots
can utilize this sensor to provide safe interaction with the
environment. This can be especially pertinent for bilateral
cooperative manipulation and master-slave telesurgery.
The variable admittance control takes the sensing advan-
tage from the multi-function force sensing instrument. It re-
ﬂects the natural physical interaction between the tool and the
environment. It can adapt to the current RCM point without
the assumption that the RCM point is static. Mechanical
RCM does not provide the ﬂexibility to vary the RCM point,
while software virtual RCM that uses geometric constraints
can incorporate the multi-function force sensing instrument
to update the current RCM location. The variable admittance
control law can also be incorporated with other virtual ﬁxture
methods, such as the constrained optimization framework
[21], [22]. Ultimately, it should provide a transparent and
intuitive interface that can incorporate useful feedback and
natural motion guidance.
We have presented a novel multi-function force sensing
instrument designed for vitreoretinal surgery procedures and
measures not only the forces at the instrument tip, but
also the sclera contact position and the corresponding sclera
contact force. A variable admittance robot control method
was developed that incorporates this information to provide
a transparent and intuitive robot behavior that can minimize
eye motion while enabling tool manipulation inside the eye,
as well as provide useful sclera force feedback to assist
1417
to reposition the eye. This system can potentially provide
safe, stable micromanipulation that can improve the outcome
of the retinal microsurgery. In the future, we will further
investigate this system in phantom and in vivo experiments.
