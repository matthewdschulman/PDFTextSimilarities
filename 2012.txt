AbstractÑ Autonomous robots need to make sense of their
surroundings, recognize objects, detect and, possibly, identify
the people around them. Visual perception would be ideally
suited for these tasks. Yet, visual perception remains one
of the limiting factors of modern robotics: artiÞcial vision
systems tend to perform poorly in normal environments, where
the scene and the illumination conditions are unpredictable.
Evolution has faced similar problems, leading to surprisingly
accurate visual capabilities, even in species with very small
brains. We argue that the success of biological perception
systems relies on three fundamental computational principles:
(a) the continual coupling of perception and behavior; (b) the
resulting emergence of multimodal cues; (c) and their efÞcient
integration. Building on these computational principles, we
describe a humanoid robot that emulates the dynamic strategy
by which humans examine a visual scene. The proprioceptive
and visual depth cues resulting from this strategy are integrated
in statistically optimal manner into a uniÞed representation.
We show that this approach yields accurate and robust 3D
representations of the observed scene.
I. INTRODUCTION
To efÞciently operate in unstructured environments, au-
tonomous robots need to establish reliable and robust repre-
sentations of the surrounding space. Vision is ideally suited
for this task, as light carries rich information about the
surfaces it interacts with, and many organisms, including
humans, make extensive use of visual information.
However, the process of reconstructing a 3D scene from
its projection on a 2D sensor is inherently ambiguous. Depth
information is not explicitly available in the images acquired
by a camera, but needs to be computed on the basis of
cues which represent it implicitly. Extraction of these cues
is challenging, as they vary tremendously with the scene
and viewing conditions, and they often tend to confound
each other when considered individually. As a consequence,
successful machine vision applications have typically been
restricted to highly controlled environments, where relevant
cues can be predicted.
Nature has faced similar problems in the development
of organisms, and evolution has led to systems that are
extremely efÞcient in processing visual information. While
multiple differences exist between the typical architectures

of robotic vision systems and the visual mechanisms of
organisms, research in sensory neuroscience has emphasized
the importance of three fundamental computational princi-
ples. These principles appear to be essential ingredients for
successful visual processing in organisms, but are rarely
followed in machine perception:
1. Vision and behavior are indissolubly coupled. Unlike
many computer vision systems, organisms are not passively
exposed to the incoming ßow of sensory data, but actively
seek useful information by coordinating sensory processing
with motor activity. Behavior is always present, even
when it is not immediately obvious. In humans and many
other species, microscopic head and eye movements occur
even in the periods of Òvisual ÞxationÓ the brief intervals
(Å300 ms) in between macroscopic relocations of gaze, in
which humans acquire visual information. Recent work has
shown that these microscopic movements operate a critical
reformatting of the spatiotemporal stimulus on the retina
[1], are under oculomotor control [2], and contribute to the
processing of visual information and the establishment of
spatial representations [3], [4], [5].
2. Vision relies on the integration of multiple cues.
Although a variety of methods for extracting 3D information
have been developed in machine vision, surprisingly little
work has been dedicated to the integration of these
techniques. As a consequence, machine vision systems often
focus on individual cues, an approach bounds to be fragile.
In contrast, depth perception in humans and primates is an
extremely parallel process which relies on the simultaneous
processing of more than 20 visual cues. Importantly, these
cues are not restricted to the visual modality. The close
coupling between behavioral and visual processes yields
depth information directly in the motor and proprioceptive
modalities (e.g., vergence and focus adjustments).
3. Cue integration tends to be optimal. A substantial body
of work shows that humans often follow a strategy of
statistical optimal integration [6], [7], [8], [5]. This approach
implies that sensory processes not only extract the relevant
cues, but also estimate their reliability on the basis of
previously acquired knowledge. It implies a probabilistic
model of the environment, which needs to be modiÞed during
the course of experience [9]. Similar optimal approaches
have been used in robotics and computer vision [10], [11],
[12] , but rarely integrates cues from visual, motor, and
proprioceptive signals [13], as humans appear to do.
In a series of recent studies, we have focused on the close
coupling between perception and action and examined the 3D
information that emerges from replicating human head and

eye movements in robots. We have Þrst focused on small
camera rotations similar to the Þxational eye movements
continually performed by humans [14], [3], [15], [16], and,
more recently, integrated these movements with small plat-
form rotations similar to Þxational head movements [17],
[18]. Here, we extend this previous work by coupling the
active Þxation strategy followed by humans with a processing
architecture based on the two other computational principles,
the Bayesian integration of the available visual, motor, and
proprioceptive cues. The result is a humanoid robot that
replicates humans both in the way they acquire and process
visual information. We show that the approach leads to robust
3D representations in the peripersonal space.

reference frame centered on the cameraÕs optical point and
oriented in such a way that the z-axis coincides with the

where, we have introduced the disparity d deÞned as the
inverse of the depthZ [20]. In this equation, each component
of the optic ßow (ú x, ú y) is divided into two elements, r and t,
which depend on the angular and translational motion of the
camera, respectively. It is important to observe that Eq. (1)
strictly holds for small velocities only, an assumption that is
well justiÞed for the behavior considered in this study.
III. ACTIVE MAINTENANCE OF FIXATION
During normal Þxation, humans continually perform
(without being aware of them) microscopic head and eye
movements. In this study, we used the APLab humanoid
robot to replicate this behavior. Head movements measured
in human observers during natural Þxation [4] were used as
input signals to the motor which controlled the neck move-
ments of the robot. The cameras were actively controlled to
counterbalance the effect of head movements and maintain
Þxation (see Þg. 1). This approach resulted in visual input

signals similar to those normally experienced by humans
during Þxation.
Use of this approach, requires previous estimation of two
components: the optic ßow and the velocity of the camera.
That is, the establishment of 3D representations requires
simultaneous computation of egomotion, two problems that
are often treated separately in machine vision. Again, compu-
tation of the optic ßow is simpliÞed by the small changes in
the images resulting from Þxational behavior, which allows
the use of Þrst order differential methods [21]. The camera
velocity can be estimated on the basis of multiple cues:
the control signals fed to the robot (the motor signals), the
signals measured by the motor encoders (the proprioceptive
signals), and/or the way the images acquired by the camera
change over time (the visual signals). Since movements are
small, an efÞcient approach requires the integration of more
than one of these signals, as explained below.
IV. BAYESIAN MULTIMODAL INTEGRATION
The model of Bayesian integration used in this study is
summarized in Fig. 2. The model is based on two parallel and
interacting data streams, each one processing one of the two
types of sensory data considered here: the visual input and
proprioception. The visual input is processed to extract the
optic ßow by means of a standard computer vision algorithm
[22]. The proprioceptive input is processed by a kinematic
model of the robot to provide a Þrst estimate of the camera
motion. These two streams are then integrated following a
Bayesian approach to solve two problems: the estimation of
egomotion and the establishment of a 3D representation of
the scene.
A. The proprioceptive ßow
This sensory path estimates the motion of the camera by
combining proprioceptive cues with the kinematics model
of the robot. At each time step, it Þrst computes the ho-
mogeneous matrix describing the camera pose (M
t
): the 3D
position of its optical point and the orientation of the line
of sight. Then, it computes the homogeneous matrix M

which directly gives the translational and rotational compo-
nents of the camera velocity.
Small errors in the proprioceptive data could lead to
signiÞcant errors in the estimate of egomotion. For this
reason, we used a Monte Carlo method to quantify the
uncertainty of the estimate. We generated a normal distri-
bution of motor positions with mean equal to the value
given at any time by the encoders and variance taken from
the motor speciÞcations sheets. The resulting distribution
was then Þltered through the kinematic model to make a
prediction of the position of the optical point and obtain the
corresponding distribution. This enabled estimation of the
standard deviation of the measurement.
B. The visual ßow
The second sensory pathway processed the visual input
to extract its optic ßow as described above. The optic ßow
was used both for egomotion estimation as well as for
establishing a 3D map of the scene.
Visual estimation of the trajectory of the optical point was
obtained by tracking a set of points during Þxation. This
step is not conceptually necessary, but it was implemented
to speed up robotic experiments, as the resulting reduction of
dimensionality enabled faster control. The points (features)
were selected by means of corner detection algorithm with
the requirement of a sufÞciently sparse distribution across
the image. These corners were then tracked and monitored
as proposed by Shi and Tomasi [23].
At each time step, the tracking algorithm yields the
position (x
i
,y
i
) of each selected feature and its displacement
(ú x
i
, ú y
i
). If the feature disparity (d
i
) is known, the problem of
visually estimating ego-motion becomes linear (see Eq. (1)).
During active Þxation, the distance of each feature from the
robot remains approximately constant. Thus, we can use the
disparity estimated at the previous time step in Eq. (1) and
propagate its uncertainty in the equation.
C. Bayesian integration: egomotion estimation
The Bayesian integration of visual and proprioceptive in-
formation in the estimate of egomotion relied on an extended
Kalman Þlter, an approach similar to those of previous
studies on structure from motion [24], [25] and visual mono
SLAM [11], [26]. The state of the Þlter was given by the
velocity of the camera, the visual location of the features
and their disparity (see Eq. (3)). At each time step, the
camera velocity was estimated on the basis of proprioception
and was plugged in eq. (1) to predict the new position in
the image of the tracked features. The predicted position of
the features was then compared to the position provided by
tracking to obtain the innovation. The Jacobian of equations
(3) with respect to the state of the system was then used
to update the covariance matrix of the state, which was in
turn used together with the covariance of the observation (the
position of the features provided by tracking) to compute the
Kalman gain.

D. Bayesian integration: 3D representation
The optic ßow and the instantaneous velocity of the cam-
era were integrated by an iconic Kalman Þlter to estimate the
disparity of the scene (we used disparity rather than depth to
linearize equations [20]). Because of the small amplitude of
head movements, relative changes in distance are negligible,
and disparity can be considered constant during Þxation (see
equation 4). We modeled the small error resulting from this
as Gaussian noise ?

V. EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS
A. Robotic platform and experimental procedures
The approach was tested on the APLab humanoid robot,
a platform speciÞcally designed to model the sensory inputs
experienced by humans during normal oculomotor behav-
ior [15] (Fig. 4). It consists of torso equipped with a 7
degrees of freedom head, three in the neck (controlling yaw,
pitch, and roll rotations) and two in each camera (controlling
pan and tilt rotations). Camera movements as well as yaw
neck rotations are given by Þve independent stepper motors.
Roll and pitch rotations are controlled by two servo-motors.
Monochromatic images were acquired by the left camera
of the robot at a resolution of1392?1040 pixels. The camera
was equipped with a wide-angle lens (15mm) to obtain a
broad Þeld of view. Images were resized by a factor of two
for computational reasons and processed to extract optic ßow
in a 11?11 pixels neighborhood.
The robot moved so as to replicate head trajectories
previously recorded from human observers by means of
a customized high-resolution motion tracking system [4].
These signals were resampled at 15 Hz and used to control

the robot neck motors. Fixation was maintained by the left
cameras, which moved to counteract neck rotations and
eliminate displacements in the image [28].
The extended Kalman Þlter was initialized with the values
given by proprioception using the Monte Carlo approach
described above (see Section IV-A) on a population of 500
points. Disparity was empirically initialized at 1 with initial
covariance set to inÞnite because of the lack of previous
depth information. The standard deviation of the optic ßow
was empirically set to 0.5 pixels.
B. Results
Before testing the method with the robot, we studied its
sensitivity and robustness in computer simulations in which
the robot and its surrounding scene were modeled by means
of OpenRave [29]. We Þrst examined the sensitivity of the
method by estimating the minimum distance necessary for
discriminating between two different surfaces.
Fig. 5 shows the mean of just noticeable difference for
objects at different distances. Two surfaces were initially
placed at the same distance D from the robot. They were
then separated in depth until the difference between their es-
timated disparities became discriminable. The just noticeable
difference threshold was deÞned as the depth separation at
which the estimated disparity difference exceeded the sum
of the two standard deviation of each disparity measurement.
The distance D was then systematically varied in the range
0.3-1.1m. Results in Fig. 5 show that the approach is highly
2871
sensitive within the space nearby the agent, with threshold
approximatively equal to 10% of the actual distance.

The second simulation tested the precision of the ap-
proach. In this case, the robot was presented with a scene
consisting of four objects (three mugs and a postcard) at
different distances within the range 0.35-0.62m (Fig. 6).
Each data point in Fig. 7 represents an estimate of the
distance of one of the objects using a different head move-
ment trace (x axis). These data show that the method enabled
consistent estimation of the object distance. Importantly, the
depth order was maintained, indicating that the algorithm is
capable of establishing faithful representations of the scene.
Fig. 8 shows results obtained in real robotic experiments.
In these experiments the robot was presented with different
visual scenes, all of them extremely difÞcult to segment into
their constituent objects in the absence of 3D information.
Each column in Fig. 8 shows an image of the scene as
seen by the robot, and the established 3D map during active
Þxation. The Þrst column of Fig. 8 shows results with a
scene similar to the one studied in simulations. As in the
simulations, the robot correctly identiÞes the presence of four
objects on different distance planes. Notice the separation of
the pen from the background, a segmentation that would be
virtually impossible on the basis of the features present in a
single image [30]. The central column shows an example of
application of the method to the breaking of camoußage. In
this case the object has the same texture of the background,
yielding very effective camoußage in each individual image.
Use of the parallax present during Þxational behavior breaks
the camoußage and reveals the object. Finally, the right
column in Fig. 8 illustrates the application of the method to
a complex scene with strong depth gradients. In this scene,
the postcard is aligned at an angle with respect to the optical
axis, yielding a depth gradient that is correctly detected by
the robot. Again the system correctly identiÞes the depth
order of all objects in the scene.
VI. CONCLUSIONS
While performing tasks that require 3D visual informa-
tion, humans and other primates do not rely on any single
individual cue. Rather, they integrate multiple cues into a
uniÞed percept of 3D space, and the active mechanisms by

which this integration occurs have now started to emerge.
Here, we have shown some of the beneÞts that derive
from following similar strategies in a robot that replicates
the Þxational behavior of humans and optimally integrates
the resulting proprioceptive and visual cues. This approach
regards the two problems of estimating egomotion and
establishing 3D representations as two faces of the same
coin and addresses them simultaneously. The resulting tight
integration of sensory perception and motor control provides
a 3D representation of the scene which is maintained into
an image-centered frame of reference. This representation
facilitates image segmentation and Þgure/ground segregation,
and can be easily integrated with other visual cues, such
as stereopsis, which provides depth information in the same
frame of reference.

Fig. 8. Results from robotic experiments. Each column compares a scene presented to the robot (top) to the estimated map of distance obtained during
active Þxation (bottom). (a-b) An example with a scene similar to the one studied in simulations. As in the simulations, the robot correctly identiÞes
the presence of four objects on different distance planes. (c-d) An example of breaking of camoußage and Þgure/ground segregation. The object is not
immediately visible in a single image, but emerges during motor activity. (e-f) An example with a complex scene with depth gradients. The postcard is
aligned at an angle with respect to the optical axis, yielding a depth gradient that is correctly detected by the robot.
