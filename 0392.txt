Abstract— This paper presents a control framework for
arm/hand systems aimed at controlling internal forces ex-
changed between the ﬁngers and the grasped object, and
enforcing a compliant behavior in presence of environmental in-
teractions. A dynamic planner computes the motion references
for the ﬁngers by using the feedback of the contact forces, while
an impedance control, in which dynamic effects exerted by the
hand on the wrist are explicitly taken into account, is designed
for the arm. The approach is experimentally validated on a
7-DOFs Barrett WAM with a Barrett Hand280.
I. INTRODUCTION
Robotic applications relying on multi-ﬁngered hands
are challenging scenarios involving several ﬁelds, such as
biomedical, service and prosthetic robotics. A key issue in
robotic grasping is how to deal with the control of the contact
forces applied by the ﬁngertips to the grasped object, in such
a way to prevent slippage and/or excessive stresses. At the
same time, since robotic hands are often involved in strict
contact with humans, a strategy to handle contacts with the
external environment must be developed as well.
There are many works dealing with the problem of ob-
ject manipulation and grasping. Useful surveys focused on
contact modeling, multi-ﬁngered robotics hands design and
grasp properties can be found in [1], [2].
In order to cope with external environment interactions,
the impedance control law is one of the most adopted strate-
gies for robot manipulators [3]. Impedance concept has been
successfully extended to multi-arm cooperative systems: in
detail, in [4] the impedance paradigm is exploited to regulate
internal contact forces and rigidly move the grasped object,
while in [5] an impedance scheme is designed to confer
a compliant behavior to the object (external impedance)
and avoid large internal stresses to the object (internal
impedance). For arm-hand systems impedance control ap-
proaches have been devised in [6], [7], where the virtual
object concept is exploited to design an Intrinsically Passive
Control (IPC) that can be used both for approaching the
object and for grasping tasks. Others impedance control
schemes for robotic hands have been proposed in [8], com-
bined with an algorithm for grasp forces optimization, in
[9], combined with an extended Kalman ﬁlter for friction
estimation and in [10], where an impedance framework with
multi-priority tasking is designed.

An alternative to the impedance control is the adoption
of hybrid force/position control schemes, as in [11], where
the force on the ﬁngers are seen as the sum of two or-
thogonal components: the manipulation force, necessary to
impose object motion, and the grasping force, necessary to
fulﬁll friction cone constraints. In [12] an hybrid impedance
control is proposed for a robotic hand in order to recreate
the movement and force of a human massage therapist:
the lateral position of the robot ﬁngertip is controlled by
position-based impedance control, while the ﬁngertip force
for the vertical direction of human skin is controlled by force-
based impedance control. Finally, parallel force/position con-
trol [13] can be adopted to reach both the reference position
in the unconstrained directions and the reference forces in
the constrained ones [14], [15], [16].
In this paper, a control framework for arm/hand systems
is devised, which integrates an internal force control for
the grasped object and an impedance control for the arm
wrist, ensuring both a compliant behavior in the presence
of environment interactions and that the object is held by
the hand. More in detail, a dynamic planner, including
the feedback of the measured contact forces, computes the
motion references in Cartesian space for the ﬁngers, that are
fed to a standard inverse kinematics algorithm in order to
obtain the joint motion references for a low level controller.
As concerns the arm, an impedance ﬁlter is adopted in
order to make the controller performance independent from
the knowledge of the dynamic model, while a pure motion
controller is in charge of following motion references. It is
worth noting that the impedance ﬁlter requires the wrench
measured by a force/torque wrist sensor and a compensation
term taking into account the effects on the wrist due to hand
dynamics and contact forces.
The effectiveness of the proposed control scheme has been
experimentally tested on a setup consisting of a 7DOFs Bar-
ret WAM with a wrist-mounted 6-axis force/torque sensor,
and a BarrettHand, attached on the arm wrist, with joint
torques sensors and tactile sensors providing 96 cells of
tactile-array data spread across all three ﬁngers and the palm.
II. MODELING
In a robotic arm/hand system the hand (or gripper) is
usually mounted on the wrist and, if a wrist force/torque
sensor is available, the measurements keep track of the hand
dynamics. The only way to compensate these forces, if the
wrist has to be reactive only to interaction forces, is by
computing a dynamic model of the hand with a ﬂoating base
(the palm).

III. CONTROL ARCHITECTURE
Grasping and manipulation of an object require ﬁne con-
trol of internal contact forces, in order to stabilize the grasp
when the object is moved along a planned trajectory. Internal
force control should prevent contact breaks and/or excessive
stresses on the object.
The control system should be able to deal with all those
events involving environmental or human interaction in
safety conditions. A way to guarantee a safe behavior of
the manipulation system is that of resorting to an impedance
control scheme, which ensure good tracking of the reference
trajectory in absence of interaction, while enforcing a com-
pliant behavior when an unexpected interaction happens.
A. Hand control
Robotic hands are not usually torque controlled since
the actuation system could be very complex, due to space
limitation and, thus, it would be useful to compute motion
references of the ﬁngers through a dynamic planner. A low
level controller, often embedded, is in charge of tracking joint
references. Let ?
cj
be a reference frame, hereafter contact
frame, attached to the object at the jth contact point. By
assuming that only ﬁngertips are involved in grasping (ﬁne
manipulation), i.e. the number of contact points and ﬁngers
is the same, the dynamic planner for ﬁnger j, designed to
control internal forces, is given by

algorithm.
B. Arm control
The aim is that of making the wrist able to track the
desired trajectory with good accuracy in the absence of
any interaction, while a compliant behavior is expected if
interactions occur: this could be achieved via an impedance
control law. More in detail, an impedance ﬁlter is adopted in
order to make the controller performance independent from
the knowledge of the dynamic model, while a pure motion
controller is in charge of following the motion references.

IV. CASE STUDY
Experiments have been conducted in order to test the per-
formance of the proposed scheme. The experimental setup,
available at the Computer Science Robotics Laboratory of
the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI), Troy, New York,
consists of a 7-DOFs Barret WAM and a Barrett Hand 280
898
Fig. 2. Experimental setup in the initial conﬁguration. The reference frames
are visible: base frame on the bottom and object frame on the top. The axes
are ordered as follows: x red, y green, z blue
attached to the arm wrist. The available feedback consists of
joint positions, sampled at 500 Hz for the arm and 100 Hz
for the hand, force/torque at the wrist, sampled at 500 Hz
and tactile pressure on the ﬁngertip and palm (4 matrices of
24 sensors each), sampled at 40 Hz. Robot Operating System
(ROS) [18] is used to control the whole system.
Tactile pressures are integrated on the ﬁngertip surfaces in
order to estimate the normal contact forces. Since the hand is
underactuated and only normal contact forces are available as
feedback, the control law (22) has been projected along the
normal to the object surface at each contact point, hereafter
contact normal. The hand has 4 motors, one for each ﬁnger
and the forth for the spread, which is the motion of ﬁngers
1 and 2 around the axis normal to the palm. The spread
has been kept constant and set to zero. By neglecting the
spread contribution, the positional part of the hand Jacobian,

The performed case study consists of a ﬁrst phase in
which the object is grasped by the hand and the contact
forces are regulated at suitable values; once the grasp is
made, the object is moved along a planned trajectory while a
human operator interacts with the object itself: the idea is that
of ensuring a compliant behavior maintaining, at the same
time, a ﬁrm grasp. At the end of the trajectory the object is
pressed against a planar surface without neither sliding on it
or human operator interaction.
A. Experimental results
The hand grasps the object in such a conﬁguration that
the ﬁngertips are symmetric with respect to the object CoG,
as depicted in Fig. 2: contact normal forces are regulated to
5 N for ﬁnger 1 and 2, and 10 N for the thumb. It can be
recognized that the desired normal forces are a set of internal
forces since they constitute a self-balancing system. Despite
the low rate at which the tactile pressures data are sampled,
40 Hz, the controller, which runs at 100 Hz, is able to drive
the contact forces to the desired values, within an acceptable

ﬁnger 2 on the middle and thumb on the bottom
error as shown in Fig. 3. For the ﬁrst 24 s the object is
grabbed and the normal contact forces are regulated, in the
last 16 s the trajectory is executed. After the object has been
grasped, starting from the initial conﬁguration, depicted in
Fig. 4(a), the object should be moved of ?0.5 m along the
z axis and 0.3 m along the x axis of the base frame, while
maintaining the position along the y axis. The trajectory has
been generated using ﬁfth order polynomial time proﬁle. The
ﬁnal orientation should be such that the x axis of the object
frame will be parallel to the x axis of the world frame.

During the motion, a human operator interacts with the
object, by pushing or pulling the handle attached on it,
as shown in Fig. 5. It is worth noting that only static
compensation has been performed according to (25). The
manipulation system should not be compliant along and
around the y axis of the base frame, i.e., the measured
component of wrist forces and moment are not fed to the
impedance ﬁlter. The IK errors of the object, both in terms of
position and orientation, are shown in Fig. 6: good tracking
of the motion reference is ensured, at planning level.
Fig. 7 shows the pose error of the object: it could be
recognized that along the y direction there is a good tracking
of the planned position while a certain error is observed along
the compliant directions. Around 32 s the object interacts
with a planar horizontal surface: this explains the large error
at steady state. The same consideration can be done for the
orientation error: the presence of the steady state error can
be justiﬁed considering that the surface is not either perfectly
horizontal or planar.
V. CONCLUSIONS
An experimental study of an arm/hand system has been
presented exploiting the impedance paradigm and internal

The law (27) could be analyzed in two different orthogonal
domains, in the Cartesian space and in the null space of J.
In Cartesian space, the asymptotic convergence of e
