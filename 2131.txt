controllable mechanical damping. It has been developed to 
provide subsequently the actuation means for haptic interfaces 
that can demonstrate intrinsic passive performance when 
rendering hard contacts. The overall actuator is a dual 
actuation system where one actuator is responsible for 
generating the joint motion while the second is dedicated to 
regulating the physical damping through a semi-active friction 
mechanism. This semi active friction mechanism applies a 
purely dissipative torque on the joint, which can be 
continuously controlled to render damping levels ranging from 
completely free to heavily damped and even a completely 
locked joint. The present work focuses mainly on the 
mechatronic details of the actuator design and in particular on 
the modelling and control of the damper. The proposed 
variable damping mechanism is evaluated in a simple 1-DOF 
joint. Experimental results are presented to demonstrate that 
the unit is capable of replicating physical damping with 
adequate performance. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
Over time a number of key actuation technologies 
(electric, pneumatic, hydraulic, etc) have been used to power 
a variety of haptic feedback systems ranging from tactile 
feedback devices [1], desktop force feedback devices to full 
arm/hand exoskeleton systems [2],[3]. Of all actuator 
technologies the electric motor (DC or brushless DC motors) 
has been the most predominant approach. Transparency, 
force feedback fidelity and stability under a wide range of 
interaction parameters are all essential characteristics that any 
high performance haptic feedback device should posses. 
Actuators with high force bandwidth and low inertia; with 
low reduction ratio and low friction transmission systems, 
such as capstan drives, are usually integrated into light 
weight structures with optimized mechanical design to ensure 
transparency and force feedback fidelity. Although 
transparency and force fidelity can be partially achieved with 
the aforementioned design approaches, to concurrently 
ensure stability under a wide range of operating conditions 
and human interactions is a significant issue yet to be 
addressed. 
The most common simulated surface constraint in haptics 
consists of a virtual spring and a virtual damper. It is well 
known that these virtual wall implementations when rendered 
through digital control of an electric motor can create 
instabilities.  Virtual springs and dampers can appear also 
active when simulated, in contrast to their real counterparts

who are always passive. These instabilities can be triggered 
by some erratic behaviour of the operator but have their root 
in intrinsic actuation, sensing and computational issues which 
affect their control. Such factors include the finite resolution 
of the sensors and their quantization noise [4], the existence 
of structural elasticity, the interaction between the discrete-
time system (virtual wall force computation) and the 
continuous-time device/human operator [5]; the finite 
sampling rate and delays due to numerical integration [6] or 
other communication time delays between the haptic device 
and its controller or the slave tele-operated robot. 
Apart from ensuring the fidelity of the interaction the 
stability of the haptic device is also critical for assuring the 
safety of the user in cases of powerful devices. 
The stability region of virtual walls represented by virtual 
spring-damper systems was first studied by [7]. The analysis 
in [5],[8],[9] represents one of the studies in the literature 
towards a common stability condition for haptic displays. It 
has been shown experimentally that the stable region can be 
increased if the haptic device is physically damped [8],[9]. 
The approaches introduced in [10],[11],[12], consider time-
domain passivity controllers where variable active damping 
is used to eliminate the energy generated by the haptic 
device. A more complex model of the haptic system 
including physical damping was investigated in [13]. It was 
demonstrated that higher physical damping allows for a 
larger stable virtual stiffness. Furthermore, for large values of 
the physical damping the maximum stable stiffness depends 
linearly on the sampling rate and the physical damping. The 
above studies and results suggest that an actuator with 
integrated variable physical damping may significantly 
improve the performance of a force feedback device when 
rendering hard contacts by intrinsically ensuring the device 
stability. 
Looking at the relevant literature several semi-active 
damping systems have been proposed in various areas. 
Methods include friction based dampers[14] and 
magnetorheologial fluids [15],[16]. Semi-active adjustable 
dampers based on magnetorheologial fluids can provide 
variable damping levels on demand. However the 
introduction of liquids within the joint’s structure 
complicates the mechanical design. In [17] the use of eddy 
currents provides nearly pure dissipative damping in terms of 
a force proportional to velocity. However the dissipative 
capacity of the system in very limited in terms of available 
damping torque. A more suitable implementation of semi-
active damping, fitting the purpose of robotic applications, 
has been presented in [18] and [19].  This takes the form of a 
piezoelectric driven friction mechanism embedded in a 
compliant actuator.

The current work presents the design and development of 
an actuator incorporating a semi-active variable damper. The 
implemented damper is a fast and strong friction mechanism 
with high dissipative capacity which can be controlled to 
modulate the apparent damping of the joint over a wide 
range. This paper is organized as follows. Section II presents 
the overall mechatronic design and the system architecture. 
Section III describes in detail the methods for designing the 
friction interface and produces a model of the system. Section 
IV presents the employed control scheme while section V 
presents the experimental results to validate the actuator 
functionality. Finally, section VI summarises the conclusions 
of this work. 
II. SYSTEM DESCRIPTION 
A. Actuator Mechanical Assembly 
The developed hybrid actuator consists of the main motor 
driving the joint and a damper mechanism controlled by a 
secondary actuator. A conceptual diagram of the system is 
presented in Figure 1.  The joint motor drives the output link 
in a direct drive fashion, while the damper assembly provides 
damping in the form of controlled friction acting on the rare 
side of the main motor shaft. In this arrangement the damper 
is effectively connected in parallel to the output link with 
respect to ground (i.e. the actuator casing). A section view of 
the actuator is shown in Figure 2. The developed actuator is 
presented in Figure 3. It consists of two primary sub-
assemblies, the main motor assembly and damper motor 
assembly. Starting from the left hand side the actuator in 
Figure 2 can be described as follows. The main motor 
assembly incorporates a frameless DC motor (Kollmorgen 
Model: QT-1406) with a custom casing and shaft.  An optical 
incremental encoder with 40960 counts/rev (Model: MicroE 
5340, CE300-4) is encased in the motor housing and provides 
position measurement of the rotor.  The rotor shaft extends 
backwards providing a mounting location for the brake disk. 
The brake disk is attached to the joint motor shaft in a 
manner that it allows it to be clamped between the stationary 
pad and the movable pad upon actuation of the damper drive, 
shown graphically in Figure 1.

Figure 1 Conceptual schematic of the actuator and damper  
The stationary brake pad is formed by an annular boss on 
the main motor casing, which has a clearance from the 
rotating disc.  The disc is made thin and flexible in its central 
area and rigid on its perimeter in order to be able to flex 
backwards upon compression and to come into contact with 
the fixed pad. This limits the axial load put by the linear joint 
on the main motor shaft and allows for self-freeing of the 
disc. The movable pad is mounted on the linear joint and is 
driven by the damper motor assembly through a ball screw 
arrangement. As the ball screw extends the movable pad is 
pressed against the disk attached to the shaft of the main 
actuator which is then clamped on either side between the 
pads. The friction pads are made of aluminum while the disc 
is made of steel.  The movable pad is mounted on the slider 
through a custom compliant element and a two-axis 
force/torque sensor. The compliant element is a spiral/volute 
spring designed to flex in and out of its plane, shown in 
Figure 3. It has a stiffness of ~320N/mm and is made of steel. 
It can deflect up to 1.5mm, beyond which it is mechanically 
locked for overload protection.

b) Main motor and damper assemblies exposing the brake disk, c) The F/T

With this stiffness and with the current position encoder the 
damper has a theoretical force resolution through position 
measurement of ~7.8? 10
-3
N. Following the methods 
1079
 
 
 
presented subsequently in section III the theoretical 
resolution of the damping torque through position 
measurement is calculated at ~52? 10
-6
Nm.  The compliant 
element is mounted at its centre to the force/torque sensor 
and at its perimeter to the movable friction pad.  To block all 
rotations and unwanted deflection of the spring as a result of 
loads during damper operation, the compliant element is 
constrained to linear only deflection with 4 linear guide pins; 
the anti-roll pins visible in Figure 2. The linear joint assembly 
is further composed of the slider piston which is driven by 
the ball screw and slides in a brass bush constrained by two 
horizontal guide pins. A double direction thrust bearing takes 
the axial load off the damper motor and limits the shaft axial 
play.  The damper motor is a gearless dc motor (Maxon 20W, 
RE25) with 297mNm stall torque, and an optical encoder 
identical to that of the main motor. 
B. Force/Torque Sensor 
The force-torque sensor shown in Figure 3 provides 
measurement of the normal force and of the friction torque 
applied by the movable pad on the disc. Its design is of the 
spokes on a hub type employing semiconductor strain 
gauges. Eight pairs of strain gauges are distributed on the 4 
axisymmetric spokes forming two averaging signals which 
are sensitive to force and torque on the z axis. The 
force/torque sensor was calibrated using an ATI Mini45 force 
torque sensor in a modified assembly where both the sensors 
were mounted back to back inside the actuator. A plot of the 
sensor output after calibration against the Mini45, shown in 
Figure 4, indicates a good match and a successful calibration.   
 
Figure 4 The sensor output versus an ATI Mini45 sensor. 
C. System Architecture 
The system architecture is presented in Figure 5. The two 
motors are controlled by two dedicated controller boards 
running 1kHz control loops and communicating over a LAN 
network. The host computer runs the high level control, 
commanding variables such as wall position, stiffness and 
damping of an interaction.  These commands are transferred 
through UDP to the two controllers and are shared.  In this 
implementation the main motor controller performs the 
position and stiffness control and passes its system states to 
the damper motor controller which controls friction for 
achieving the required damping. 
III. DAMPER DESIGN METHOD AND MODEL 
With reference to Figure 1, the torque of the damper 
motor ?
D
 is converted by the ball screw assembly into a 
normal force F which acts through the movable brake pad on 
the brake disc to produce the damping torque ?
fr
. To compute 
design parameters such as friction surface geometry and 
actuator power, associated with the capacity of the friction 
mechanism to generate torque, we use the uniform pressure 
theory, which is relevant to clutches and brakes. With the aid 
of Figure 6 let us assume a friction surface as an annular 
sector A, formed by a rotating disc and a pad.  From uniform 
pressure theory it can be shown (although omitted here for 
brevity) that for this type of friction surface geometry the 
effective friction torque ?

Although the angle ? and the area A of the annular sector 
are used in the derivation of (1), they do not appear in this 
equation, which describes the transformation of force into 
torque by friction. This is in accordance with Amonton’s 
second law according to which, macroscopically, friction is 
independent of the area of contact.  However, A would indeed 
become relevant when considering operation over long 
periods of time and for high levels of dissipative work where 
heat is produced at a high rate. The transfer of heat generated 
at the frictional interface into the system’s surroundings 
should be expected to mainly take place by conduction and 
would be proportional to the contact area A. Therefore A 
should be large enough to assist heat transfer preventing 
temperature build up at the contact, which would lead to 
excessive wear and alteration of material properties including 
the coefficients of friction. 
For multiple friction surfaces ? with the same friction 
coefficient and one commonly applied normal force F, the 
total available friction torque ?
fr_tot
 is proportional to the 
normal force and the total mean radius R
tot
 of the system, (3). 
R
tot
 is the sum of the individual mean radii R
?
 of the friction 
surfaces (4). The conversion of the damper motor torque ?
D
 
into normal force F through the ball screw is given by (5), 
where l and ? are the pitch and the efficiency of the ball 
screw. Finally the relationship between the damper motor 
torque and the generated friction torque is given by (6).  It is 
obvious that (6) has a meaning only when the output link is 
moving or when the damper is balancing a torque applied on 
it through static friction, in which case the static friction 
coefficient  should be used. 
With the above methodology the damper actuator was 
designed and the transmission and actuation components 
were selected. The adopted geometry for the friction interface 
and the calculated frictional properties of the two pads for the 
cases of a dry and a lubricated contact, are listed in TABLE I. 
The system’s force to toque coefficient ?
F?_tot 
and the total 
friction torque capacity ?
fr_tot
 are summarized in TABLE II. In 
the implemented system the friction surfaces were lubricated 
for a smoother operation. According to these characteristics 
the available friction torque is enough to control damping and 
to even completely brake the main actuator.

IV. DAMPER SYSTEM CONTROL 
The aim of the damper control system is to control 
damping by modulating the torque ?
fr_tot
 applied to the output 
link according to (7). Where, 
M
?
?
is the velocity of the output 
link and C
app
 is the damping coefficient realized with the 
regulation of ?
fr_tot
, C
sys
 is the inherent damping coefficient of 
the link and C
req
 is the total damping coefficient required for 
the link. From (3) and (7) the relationship between the 
applied normal force F and the link’s damping is given in (8). 
Although damping could be regulated by directly controlling 
the applied force or torque using the force/torque sensor 
signal, as shown in (7) and (8), in this work it is performed 
by regulating the position of the damper motor. The reason is 
that both friction and normal force would be both 
problematic signals at the boundary of a rigid-free contact.  
This contact boundary exists in the system by design, since 
while the damper is retracting backwards it can attain 
positions where the movable pad looses contact with the disc 
and is traveling in free space.  During free space travel, the 
force and torque seen at the sensor should be zero.  Therefore 
at the event of loss of contact between the movable pad and 
the disc force and torque would become uncontrollable. To 
avoid hard contacts and the aforementioned nonlinearity the 
system incorporates a compliant element (discussed 
previously and shown in Figure 2 and Figure 3).  In the 
current implementation it has a stiffness of 320 N/mm and a 
deflection of 1.5mm, which provides enough resolution and 
range (see section II.A ) for position control of the system. 
Therefore position becomes the means to modulate the 
applied force, circumventing the problem of force and torque 
nonlinearity at the point of contact ?
C
. 
Considering the conversion of rotation into translation via 
the ball screw, the normal force is related to angular position 
as shown in (9). Where K
rot
 is an equivalent coefficient of 
stiffness along the ball screw displacement with units N/rad, 
?
def
 is the equivalent angular deflection of the spring, ?
D
 is the 
angular position of the damper motor, and ?
C
 is the angular 
position of the damper motor when the movable pad initially 
contacts the disc. The equivalent rotational stiffness K
rot
 is 
obtained by taking position measurements at the damper’s 
encoder and force measurements form the sensor adjacent to 
the movable pad, shown in Figure 7. This equivalent stiffness 
K
rot
 includes the stiffness of the compliant element, the 
1081
 
 
 
stiffness of the force torque sensor and the stiffness of the 
housing structure. A 6
th
 order polynomial fit is used to model 
the stiffness at forces lower than 10N where it appears 
nonlinear. Finally the required damping C
req
 is controlled by 
regulating the angular position of the damper motor ?
D
 to 
achieve the required angular deflection ?
def
 according to the 
equivalent stiffness K rot and the position ?
C
 of pad to disc 
contact, shown in (10).

V. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 
The response of damper motor to a sinusoidal reference is 
shown in Figure 9.  It can be noticed that position tracking is 
very good, while also the measured force is also close to that 
computed with the stiffness model. To evaluate the 
performance of the damper a pendulum experiment was 
performed. The output shaft was connected through a rigid 
link to a mass of 1kg, which was allowed to oscillate from a 
high vertical position (180°) to rest at 0°. Since the main 
actuator was not the focus of this work it was kept inactive 
during the course of these experiments. Data for two damping 
coefficients, namely C
2
 and C
3
 are presented in Figure 10.

Finally the ability of the system to achieve the commanded 
damping coefficients C

, 
C

is demonstrated in Figure 12. 
To validate the design assumptions with respect to the 
friction properties of the system the ?
FT
 coefficient was 
obtained experimentally during the pendulum experiment. A 
plot of the measured torque against the measured force, is 
shown in Figure 11. This experimentally measured value for 
?
FT_tot
 varies for the positive and negative directions by 6%.  
Furthermore, the measured ?
FT_tot
 is larger compared to the 
calculated value in TABLE II by 15% and 7% for the 
positive and negative directions respectively. This apparent 
direction dependence in the measured force-to-torque 
coefficient ?
FT_tot
 could be the result of mechanical 
inaccuracies in the actuator assembly or may emanate from 
sensor nonlinearity in this region of load.

VI. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
This paper presented the design and development of an 
actuator with variable damping in the form of a controllable 
semi-active friction mechanism. The mechatronic 
components of the actuator have been described in detail 
including the mechanical design of the actuator, the damper 
assembly and the various sensing and computation units.  The 
theoretical method for designing the damper’s friction unit 
and has been presented and a model of the system’s friction 
and stiffness has been developed. A control scheme, where 
friction is controlled through position using the stiffness-
friction model has been described. The proposed variable 
damper mechanism has been evaluated on a simple 1-DOF 
joint. The experimental results verified the design method 
since the measured characteristics of the damper match to a 
large extent the design calculations.  Furthermore the results 
have demonstrated that the unit is fast and powerful enough 
to achieve the required damping.  Further work will 
concentrate on integrating this actuator into a haptic device 
and controlling both the damper and the main actuator for the 
purpose of simulating stable stiff haptic contacts.
