Development of High-Span Running Long Jumps for Humanoids
Patrick M. Wensing and David E. Orin
AbstractÑThis paper presents new methods to develop a
running long jump for a simulated humanoid robot. Starting
from a steady-state running motion, a new spring loaded
inverted pendulum (SLIP) based 3D template model for a
running jump is presented. The use of this model is motivated
by a simpler model from biomechanics which describes the
dynamics of human long jumpers in the sagittal plane. While
previously only used to describe the thrust step of a long jump,
this type of model is also shown to generate useful Center
of Mass (CoM) trajectories to return to steady-state running
upon landing. A principled optimization approach for this new
template is described to generate reference CoM trajectories
for maximum span which are able to be kinematically and
dynamically retargeted to the humanoid. The key features of
an optimal long jump are highlighted, and a task-space control
approach to realize the motion on a humanoid is summarized.
A video attachment to this paper shows an optimal long jump
for a 6 m/s approach speed, where the humanoid is able to
clear a large gap, and highlights the effects of non-optimal
takeoff-velocity angles.
I. INTRODUCTION
Despite the capability of biological systems to perform
high-speed locomotion with ease, the ability to produce
comparable behaviors in legged machines remains limited.

Although a challenge, the development of dynamic lo-
comotion has the potential to provide humanoids with the
ability to traverse more difÞcult terrain than is accessi-
ble through quasi-static locomotion alone. The problem of
producing high-speed jumping has been studied previously
through the use of genetic algorithms [1] or through graph-
search-based methods combined with whole-body trajectory
optimization [2]. Other whole-body trajectory optimization
methods have restricted their search space through the use
of motion capture [3] to simplify the problem.
Rather than focusing on the exact trajectory details of a
dynamic motion, methods based on heuristics or template
models attempt to identify and control the salient charac-
teristics of a behavior. Hodgins et al. developed a series of

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.
Section II develops a 3D long jump template model which is

While the dynamics of takeoff and landing in a running
jump share elements in common with high-speed running,
the CoM dynamics experience a notable difference at the
beginning of stance, as shown in Fig. 2. In this period, a
large force peak contributes an initial vertical impulse to
assist the production of maximum jump span. Section III

MODEL DESCRIPTION AND VERIFICATION
A simple spring-mass system already predicts optimum strategies for the maximum jumping
distance. For quantitative descriptions leg lengthening and mass distributions must be taken
into account.
The leg as a linear spring
In a first approach to long jumping we a model will be considered in which the leg operates as
a spring. This gives basic insights into the influence of geometric parameters and the role of
leg stiffness.
It is typical that the ground reaction force during the take-off phase shows a passive and an
active peak (Fig. 3). The derived dynamic leg stiffness k dyn (t) has a first peak during the
passive phase followed by a relatively constant stiffness during the active phase up to the last
30 ms before the take-off.

remarks are provided in Section V.
II. EXTENDED 3D-SLIP TEMPLATE FOR LONG JUMP
OPTIMIZATION
While the standard 3D-SLIP model of locomotion can
be used to describe the CoM dynamics of running with
good Þdelity, it lacks the capability to describe important
characteristics of a running long jump. Biomechanics stud-
ies [7] have shown that human long jumpers employ a
lengthened leg at takeoff in comparison to touchdown. In
addition, human long jump data displays a passive ground
reaction force (GRF) peak at the beginning of stance. Two
modiÞcations to the 3D-SLIP model are described below
which provide the ability to capture these characteristics.
A. Leg Extension 3D-SLIP Model
In order to capture the leg lengthening effects found in
humanlongjumping,activelengtheningmaybeaddedtothe
3D-SLIP model. Here, this lengthening is modeled through
the incorporation of a linear actuator in series with the SLIP
spring. This modiÞcation is shown in Fig. 3(a). The model
consists of a point mass m and leg that experiences phases
of stance and ßight. The mass follows ballistic dynamics in
ßight wherein the massless leg is positioned for upcoming
stance. Following touchdown (TD), a Hookean spring with
constant k
s
imparts forces onto the mass. The period of
stance ends at liftoff (LO) when the spring once again
reaches an unstretched length. Here, forward motion is
assumed in the positive x-direction.
The dynamic evolution of the point mass is intended to
describe the center of mass of a larger system. As such,
its position in inertial coordinates is denoted as p
c

paper, a simple law is assumed for the actuator. Motivated
by human data in the sagittal plane [7], its length is chosen
proportional to the angular excursion of the SLIP leg pro-
jected onto the sagittal (x,z) plane. The angle of the SLIP
leg from the vertical in the (x,z) plane is given by:

where b

is a positive constant of proportionality to be tuned
through optimization in Section III. Forward running jumps

and `

are monotonically increasing.
B. Long Jump 3D-SLIP Model
In addition to active lengthening, human long jumpers
plant their stance foot more forcefully prior to takeoff,
resulting in a large force peak that decelerates the stance
leg mass. This force peak injects additional vertical impulse,
which is a key requirement of jumping for distance. Thefoot
plant behavior can be introduced through the addition of a
second mass to the Leg Extension SLIP model, shown in
Fig. 3(b). In this model, the mass m
2
represents the stance
leg mass, and is connected to the SLIP leg at a Þxeddistance
r
2
through a nonlinear spring-damper. The large mass m
1
is
positioned at radius r
1
and is still driven by the SLIP spring.
Similar to before, the spring produces forces

directed along ö r. These forces act only on m

. To describe
the position of mass m
2
, coordinate vectors ö x

and ö y

are
attached to and rotate with the SLIP leg. Combined with ö r
these provide a coordinate system with rotation matrix:

Again motivated by the planar case, a nonlinear spring-

in order to return it

, d

and c

are constants. The inclusion of non-
linear effects is justiÞed by considering the dynamics that
the additional mass is intended to capture; when planted
forcefully, the foot experiences ground contact forces which
can be described well with nonlinear contact models [8].
Fixed selections for c

, and k

are given in Table I.
The value of r
2
in this table is chosen to be approximately
one quarter of the extended virtual leg length (0.975 m)
of the humanoid considered in Section IV. Masses m
1
and
m
2
represent 80% and 20% of the mass of the humanoid.
Spring-damper constants for a planar long jump model
running at 8.2 m/s [7] were tuned to produce values for k
2
,
d
2
, and c
2
which resulted in similar passive force peaks for
speeds in the range of 4 m/s to 6 m/s with this model. While
Þxed here, further adaptation of these parameters could
provide beneÞts to jump span. In the following section, an
optimization-based approach will be presented to select the
rest of the parameters for the Long Jump 3D-SLIP model.
During stance, simulation of the Long Jump SLIP model
in 3D introduces additional complexities due to the forces
on the second mass. Turning Þrst to kinematics, the position
of this system can be speciÞed uniquely by r
1
, p
0
2
, and R
(which includes ö r). The system velocity is then given by
ú r
1
, ú p
0
2
, and !. Here ! gives the angular velocity of R
in inertial coordinates. R is stored using a quaternion to
avoid singularities and may be integrated with quaternion
rates given in [9]. Due to its nonlinear effects, the force
f
2
may in fact create moments around the SLIP leg that
must be countered by constraint moments at the anchor
point. Yet, in order for the anchor point to represent a
center of pressure (CoP), these constraint moments must
only exist in the ö z direction. To handle this requirement,
the anchor point is treated as a soft point contact [10].
This type of contact is able to produce moments normal
to the plane. Under this assumption, the angular velocity
can be chosen to take the form !=[!

. It can be
shownthatrestrictingangularvelocitiestothisformimposes
a nonholonomic constraint on the achievable rotations R.
Thus, this constraint precludes the use of any 2 element
parameterization for the rotation matrix R such as 2 Euler
angles. The full stance dynamics are summarized in Table II.

The total span is comprised of three components, two on
the ground and a main component in ßight. The following
subsections will present a staged optimization process which
Þrst generates a thrust step, and then subsequently generates
a landing step.
A. Thrust Step Optimization
Starting from a steady-state run, the thrust step of the long
jump serves to generate a large vertical CoM velocity before
takeoff. Generation of this vertical velocity requires proper
selection of the legÕs touchdown conÞguration as well as
proper coordination of the legÕs stroke during stance. These
details are Þrst coordinated on the Long Jump 3D-SLIP
model before being mapped to the humanoid as described
in Section IV. The touchdown span ( c   in Fig. 4) does not
vary greatly across long jumps, and thus was considered
Þxed when optimizing the thrust step.
224
The optimization approach used here applies constrained
nonlinear optimization methods, where dynamic simulation
of the Long Jump 3D-SLIP is applied to evaluate the
objective (jump span) and constraints. The optimization
variables and constraints are summarized in Table III with
further detail provided below. Simulation of the Long Jump
3D-SLIP model is carried out starting at the top-of-ßight
(TOF) before thrust, continuing through stance, and ending
at the subsequent TD. Assuming an approach speed of v
x
in the forward direction, the TOF CoM State is given from
our previous methods [6]. For a Þxed approach speed the
optimization problem is given in general form as:

of the CoM at TD can be computed from ballistic physics
without simulation. At TD, the CoM state is then mapped

often results
in trajectories that are not transferable to the humanoid. For
instance, selection of a small spring stiffness may result in
a soft landing with too low of a CoM height, while a high
spring stiffness may result in GRFs that are infeasible to be
generatedbythehumanoid.Similarly,ahighleglengthening

The model begins with a steady-state run, experiences an explosive thrust
step, and then employs a single recovery step to return to periodic motion.
B. Landing Step Optimization
The landing step optimization develops a trajectory of the
LongJump3D-SLIPmodelthatstartsinßight,followingthe
optimized thrust step, and returns to steady-state running at
the subsequent TOF. Once complete, a continuous reference
CoM trajectory is available, starting from and ending at the
CoM motion for running as shown in Fig. 5.
The optimization process to generate a landing step
largely mirrors that of the thrust step, with the main excep-
tion being its objective. Simulation occurs from the TOF
following thrust, continues through the landing step, and
terminates at the subsequent TOF. Landing optimization
employs the same variables and bounds in Table III. The
constraint onkp
c
 p
f
k is replaced with a lower bound of
0.85 m to prevent an excessively shortened leg at TD. The
lateralLOvelocityisunconstrained,andallotherconstraints
remain the same. Rather than maximizing span, the landing
step optimization minimizes the squared error between the
achieved CoM TOF state following landing and that of
steady-state running. Again, MATLABÕs fmincon was
used to optimize the SLIP touchdown and stroke parameters.
With this approach, optimized trajectories for landing were
able to perfectly match the TOF CoM state for steady-state
running. Optimized variables x for the thrust and land steps
are shown in Table IV, and result in a 4.12 m long jump.

[11] in the biomechanics literature and is inherent to the
SLIP-based model used here. At higher speeds, human long
jumpers may lose over 1.0 m/s in forward velocity in order
to achieve additional span [12].
All of the constraints placed on the Long Jump 3D-SLIP
model are limiting to its performance, and provide insight
into the key characteristics of jumping for distance. Figure 7

k, and vertical GRFs for the optimum.
Constraints on each of these quantities are active. Given
the constraint on the vertical GRF, vertical impulse may
only be increased through additional time in stance. For
the optimum, a maximum time in stance is achieved by
coordinating stiffness and lengthening of the leg to utilize
the full allowable range of its stroke. A sensitivity analysis
of the optimum reveals the importance of this principle, as
theoptimumspanincreasesby 9.7cmper 1cmofadditional
length, and by 4.8 cm per 1 cm of additional allowable
vertical excursion downward.
Aside from proper leg coordination for maximum stroke,
it is important to select proper touchdown angles to max-
imize the beneÞt of the ÓpivotingÓ or pole-vaulting effect
over the stance leg. To understand this effect, the long

this simpliÞcation, the graphical optimum for the estimated

takeoff angle has been shown for human long jumping [13],
the optimization constraints imposed here enable similar
properties to emerge from our model. Notice that at lower
speeds, the optimal takeoff-velocity angle shifts to higher
values, as additional vertical velocity may be generated with

IV. HUMANOID RUNNING LONG JUMP
Performance of the running long jump by the humanoid
can be accomplished with an extension to the state-machine-
based task-space control approach applied in humanoid
running [6]. This previous work allowed for the humanoid
to run at high speeds through tracking of hand-tuned foot
trajectories and an optimized CoM reference. The reference
CoM motions developed here Þt within this framework
without difÞculty and allow for the previous task-space
approachforrunningtobeapplied.Asinthispreviouswork,
the task-space controller is able to handle omissions in the
template,suchascontactimpulsesortheeffectsofrotational
inertia, through application of centroidal momentum control.
A video attachment to the paper shows the humanoid
tracking an optimal long jump following a 6 m/s run. The
video can also be found on the web at:
http://go.osu.edu/Wensing_Orin_ICRA2014
The humanoid used in the simulation applies torque control
at its joints in order to realize the reference CoM motion.
While space permits only a high-level description of the
control approach, the reader is referred to [6], [15] for
further details. At each control step, an embedding of the
template Long Jump 3D-SLIP CoM dynamics is accom-
plished through real-time optimization of joint torques as
well as GRFs below the feet in stance [15]. An angular
momentum controller is applied in stance to regulate the
angular momentum at takeoff and prevent excess body
rotation in ßight. While arm motion targets are supplied to
match the swing of the opposite leg, the low task weights
given to these joints allows the momentum controller to
adjust the upper body motions to maintain balance.
V. CONCLUSIONS
This paper has presented new methods to develop a
running long jump for humanoid robots. The new Long
Jump 3D-SLIP model has shown to produce optimal CoM
trajectories with properties that are consistent with human
long jumpers. With the constraints imposed on the model,
the takeoff-velocity angle has been shown to be a key
characteristic for achieving a maximum jump distance. The
constrained nonlinear optimization formulation discussed al-
lows for optimal leg coordination and takeoff-velocity angle
to be produced automatically for any given CoM approach
state. This strategy allows a previous controller for high-
speed running to be applied to control both the thrust and
landingsteps.Thecapabilityofthismethodologytogenerate
balanced yet aggressive dynamic motions encourages further
study to investigate agile behaviors such as high-speed
turning or to create additional acrobatic behaviors in ßight.
Further, investigation of real-time optimization approaches
for these systems has the potential to enable intelligent,
reactive behaviors to respond to additional uncertainties in
the environment and model.
