Development of High Performance Intrinsically Safe 3-DOF Robot
Alex S. Shafer and Mehrdad R. Kermani
Abstract— In our previous work we have introduced the
Distributed Active/Semi-Active actuation concept. This paper
presents the design of a novel three Degrees-of-Freedom (DOF)
robot manipulator based on the DASA actuation approach. The
robot is developed as a proof-of-concept prototype intended to
demonstrate the capacity of the DASA approach to achieve
a high degree of interaction safety as well as performance.
Magneto-Rheological (MR) clutches form the basis of the
Semi-active actuation component, while a unidirectional mo-
tor provides the active drive for the robot. An antagonistic
clutch conﬁguration is implemented at the joints to achieve
bi-directional actuation without reversal of the motor. MR
clutches have been shown to exhibit excellent torque-to-inertia
and torque-to-mass ratios making them likely candidates for
the development of human-safe actuators. In this paper, the
safety characteristics of the DASA approach are qualitatively
discussed. Experimental results highlighting the performance
capability of the developed robot are given.
I. INTRODUCTION
Recent years have marked substantial efforts aimed at
altering the landscape of automation by promoting access
to human safe robotic systems. Direct interaction between
humans and robots allows for new collaborative tasks to
be deﬁned. Moreover, the advent of safe robots permits a
new teaching paradigm based on interactive training. This
allows automated production to bypass the expertise and
personnel typically required to manage and conﬁgure in-
house automation systems.
There are several sources of danger when working closely
with robotic devices, however collisions between robots and
humans pose arguably the largest potential for injury. Such
collisions will become unavoidable, if not routine as man
and machine continue to integrate into a single working
environment.
Our research aims to improve access to human safe robotic
systems for small and medium sized enterprizes (SME).
Our goal is to balance the competing design requirements
of safety and performance while addressing some of the
architectural elements that tie cost to performance in this
area. We note the performance disparity that exists between
high-end [1] and low-cost [2] automation products developed
for interactive application.
A prevailing trend within the research centers around
the development of compliant actuators that achieve safety
by necessarily compromising performance. Subsequent evo-
lutions improve performance typically at the expense of
added complexity. The complexity of actuators has a direct

impact on their eventual cost. Ultimately, the balance be-
tween safety, performance and complexity appears difﬁcult
to obtain with this approach. In our work, we propose an
alternative approach based on a class of fully compliant
semi-active devices. The devices are based on Magneto-
Rheological (MR) ﬂuids and possess excellent performance
characteristics. Moreover, such devices have simple mechan-
ical constructions.
In our previous work [3], we have proposed the Dis-
tributed Active Semi Active Actuation Approach (DASA)
for human safe robotics. The underlying concept of the
DASA approach is the separation of an actuation element
into two components, namely an active (e.g. motor) and
separate semi-active (e.g. clutch) device. This opens up the
possibility of locating the active component in an area that is
remote from actuation region; that is to say, a non collocated
arrangement. Additionally, the active/semi-active separation
allows for multiple semi-active devices to be driven by a
single active component.
In this paper, we present the design and experimental
results for a 3-DOF implementation of the DASA actuation
approach (Fig. 1). The prototype manipulator developed for
this purpose is fully compliant although achieves perfor-
mance levels that are signiﬁcantly higher than the compliant
actuation approaches discussed in the following section.

II. REVIEW OF HUMAN-FRIENDLY ACTUATION
A. Joint-Torque Control
For a manipulator to be considered safe for human col-
laboration, it must be capable of control, as well as limiting
interaction forces. In addition, the manipulator inertia must
be sufﬁciently low to prevent injuries resulting from human-
robot collision. Manipulators having high inertia can however
be safe provided the velocity at which they operate is
sufﬁciently restricted, resulting in strict performance lim-
itations. Stiff manipulators require joint torque sensors to
achieve force control. Such manipulators can safely restrict
interaction forces below the bandwidth of the torque control
loop. Moreover, this class of manipulators can be controlled
to exhibit very low mechanical impedance for interactions
which have dynamics below the control bandwidth. However,
collisions which have dynamics above the bandwidth of the
torque control are subject to the open-loop characteristics of
the manipulator, which can be dangerous as a consequence
of the stiff motor coupling. To be sufﬁciently lightweight
for such applications, motors drives require considerable
gear reduction to amplify their output torque. This however,
ampliﬁes the output inertia of the motor by the square of
the gear ratio. The resulting reﬂected inertia from the motor
develops a substantial contribution towards the manipulator’s
effective inertia which can often be larger than the inertia
developed my the mass of the links.
B. Compliant Actuators
Compliant actuators dynamically decouple the reﬂected
actuator inertia from the link by integrating an elastic [4]
and/or damper [5] into the motor’s transmission. This inher-
ently improves the collision safety, however degrades the po-
sition accuracy and control bandwidth of the actuator [6]. In
response to this, variable stiffness [7] and variable impedance
actuators [8] have been developed, which can dynamically
vary their coupling parameters (i.e. stiffness/damping). Such
actuators can increase coupling stiffness at low velocities
when a higher effective inertia is tolerated without degrading
safety. In this way, control performance is improved at
low velocities. This approach require additional actuators
to vary coupling parameters and increases the mechanical
complexity of implementation. The Distributed Macro-Mini
Actuation approach (DM
2
) [9], [10], [11] was proposed as an
alternative approach to address the performance shortfall of
compliant actuators. Actuation of the joint is achieved by the
coupling of a low frequency high torque series elastic actua-
tor (SEA) with a high frequency low torque servo. The high
frequency servo is directly coupled to the joint and used to
actuate the manipulator in a complimentary frequency space
to that of the SEA. In this way, the effective controllable
bandwidth of the manipulator is improved. The low torque-
high frequency servo is selected such that its output inertia
is minimized. Thus, safety is maintained while performance
is improved. This approach again requires additional motors,
as well as a more elaborate form of transmission to combine
the two actuators. In general, a trend can be identiﬁed in

which improving the performance of this class of compliant
actuators is achieved at the cost of increasing complexity. In
addition, elastic elements have the capacity to store energy
during collisions. This adds another level of complexity as
this energy must be safely dissipated.
III. DISTRIBUTED ACTIVE SEMI-ACTIVE ACTUATION
APPROACH
The DASA approach is implemented using antagonistic
MR clutches to actuate the joints. MR ﬂuids are a suspen-
sion of micrometer-sized particles in a carrier ﬂuid. When
subjected to a magnetic ﬁeld, the particles aggregate into
columns aligned in the direction of the ﬁeld. Subsequently,
the columns act to resist shearing of the ﬂuid perpendicular
to the ﬁeld. The apparent yield stress of the ﬂuid is dependant
on, and increases with the intensity of the applied magnetic
ﬁeld. Fig. 2 shows the cross-section of a multi-disk style
MR ﬂuid clutch. MR ﬂuid ﬁlls the volume between input
and output disks. Rotation of the input shaft causes shearing
in the ﬂuid with respect to the output shaft. By energizing
the electromagnetic coil, a ﬁeld is induced in the MR ﬂuid
altering its apparent yield strength. The transmission torque
of an MR clutch is derived from the Bingham visco-plastic
model [12] and is given by
T

where H is the intensity of the applied magnetic ﬁeld, f()
is the ﬁeld dependant transmission torque,b
v
is the damping
coefﬁcient resulting from the viscosity of the MR ﬂuid, and
_
 and _ q are the absolute angular velocities of the input
and output ports of the clutch, respectively. An antagonistic
arrangement is achieved by coupling together the output from
two clutches. Because the clutches can only transmit torque
in the direction that they are driven relative to the output, we
designate apositive andnegative clutch which should thus be
driven accordingly -that is to say in opposite directions with
respect to the output. Assuming the clutches share identical
parameters, the combined output torque is given by

In contrast to the compliant actuators discussed in the pre-
vious section, actuation by antagonistic MR clutch exhibits
no elastic or viscous coupling between the input and output.

Joints one and three clutches have equivalent speciﬁcations.
Thus, actuation of a joint by an antagonistic MR clutch fully
decouples the link from the reﬂected inertia of the driving
motor. As MR clutches can be designed to achieve excellent
bandwidth, the decoupling does not come at the expense of
performance.
As discussed earlier, force/torque control is an important
element of physical human robot interaction. However, the
integration of joint-torque sensors to achieve this goal adds
considerable mechanical complexity as well as cost. To their
beneﬁt, MR clutches offer an alternative method by which
to measure the actuator torque. As the transmission torque
developed by an MR clutch is proportional to the magnetic
ﬁeld at the ﬂuid, measurement of this ﬁeld thus allows for
close estimation of the resulting torque. The use of Hall
sensors for the purpose of torque-sensorless control an MR
clutch is covered in [13], [14], [15].
IV. DESIGN OF 3-DOF DASA ROBOT
In this section we present the design of the developed
3-DOF DASA robot (Fig. 3). Key speciﬁcations of the
manipulator and clutches are given in Table I and Table II
respectively. Although the combined mass of the robot is sub-
stantial, much of this mass is located at the base of the robot
which is subject only to rotation and does not move about
the workspace. Additionally, the mass distribution in the ﬁrst
link is concentrated at the axis of rotation to minimize inertia.
The ﬂying mass of the robot, that is the mass of the robot
that undergos translational movement is only 8.95 kg. The
distinction is important as this mass comprises the signiﬁcant
portion of the manipulator’s effective inertia. The mechanical
drive for the robot is provided by a single motor coupled
through a gearbox. The drive assembly, which includes the
motor and gearbox is located at the base of the robot in order
to minimize the manipulator’s inertia. This permits the use of
heavier off-the-shelf components that are less costly as they
are not optimized for low-weight applications. The brushless
DC motor that drives the robot is produced by Hacker, model
A60-18. The motor has a mass of 910 g and produces a peak
power of 2.6 kW, sufﬁcient to power all three joints of the
robot.

A. Transmission
The use of a single motor to simultaneously drive all three
joints of the manipulator is achieved using a serially coupled
belt transmission, shown in Fig. 4. The output of the gearbox
drives a set of miter gears that produce rotation in both
clockwise (CW) and counterclockwise (CCW) directions.
The miter gears drive two sets of timing belts shown in green
and red in Fig. 4. The green belts provide CW rotation to
the joints, while the red belts provide CCW rotation. The
output of the joint two and three clutches is directly coupled
to the subsequent link by an adjoining shaft (see Fig. 6). The
output from the joint one clutches drive a winch that winds
high strength steel cable around a stationary cylinder at the
base of the robot. The cable is shown in yellow in Fig. 4.
This mechanism allows the ﬁrst joint to rotate about the axis
normal to the ground.
621
B. Control
Control of the DASA manipulator concerns joint torques,
as well as motor velocity. The torque produced by an
antagonistic MR clutch as given in (2) assumes that the
input velocity of the two clutches is equal in magnitude and
opposite in direction,
_

+

. Due to the implementation
of the serial transmission, the input ports of the joint three
clutches experience a velocity differential caused by rotation
in the second joint. In order to derive the actuation model for
the DASA manipulator, we model the transmission in terms
of

to be the angular velocity of the motor as measured after the
gearbox. The relationship between the motor velocity and
the clutch input velocity at the joints is given by

C. Design of MR Clutch
Design of the robot is based on an integrated approach
such that the clutches are assembled directly onto the output
shaft. The shaft material is used by the clutch to form the core
of the magnetic circuit. Fig. 6 shows the antagonistic clutches
integrated onto the shaft of joints one and two. The clutch

assembly is integrated directly into the timing pulley (see
Fig. 5). The pulley forms the input ports to the clutch, and
the output shaft forms the output. Clutch geometries were
determined using FEM based magnetic circuit optimization
in which the mass of the clutch is minimized for a required
design torque.
The clutch pack is constructed from an arrangement of
steel disks. Spacers fabricated using a low cost 3D printing
process are placed between disks to ensure consistent gap
widths. Titanium pins are used to transfer the torque from
the output disks to the side plates which are coupled to
the output shaft. The pins must be made from a non-
ferrous material, however care must be taken to match the
mechanical properties to that of the disks. Aluminum is
avoided as it has a substantially lower surface hardness
than that of steel from which the disks are made. Use of
such material may lead to the formation of grooves on the
pins’ surface that would manifest as backlash in ﬁne control
reversals.
Each clutch is designed to integrate two analog and

two digital Hall sensor assemblies. Analog assemblies are
comprised of two unipolar ratiometric Hall sensors (model
TLE4990, Inﬁnion) oriented to face in opposite directions.
The analog sensors are soldered to a small circuit board with
conditioning electronics. The analog Hall sensors provide a
combined range of 400 mT. A single bipolar digital Hall
sensor (model TLE4998, Inﬁnion) and circuit board comprise
the digital assemblies. The digital sensors provide a range of
200 mT. Sensor assemblies are installed at the axial center
of the disk-pack at 90
0
intervals from one another. The four
sensors are radially distributed over the active region of the
disk pack. The radial distribution allows for measurement of
variations in the radial distribution of the magnetic ﬁeld. Fig.
7 shows a cross section of the MR clutch and the relative
locations of the Hall sensor. The details of the Hall sensor
integration are reported to provide an understanding of our
implementation in the context of a mechanical discussion.
Details related to the control as well as results of this method
will be reported in upcoming publications.
V. PRELIMINARY EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
In our previous work [16], we have reported on the high
bandwidth that can be achieved in the torque control of MR
clutches. Fig. 8 shows the torque step response of the third

joint MR clutch. The step command represents 98:6% of the
clutch’s design torque (at the third joint). From the plot, we
can determine the time constant of the magnetic ﬁeld to be
less than 3.5 ms, and the time constant of the torque response
to be about 14 ms.
The high control bandwidth allows MR actuators to per-
form very well in terms of position control. Fig. 9 shows the
results of the 3-DOF DASA Arm commanded to regulate a
ﬁxed position. We note that the regulation error is mostly
contained between one to two increments of the encoder.
Fig. 10 shows the tracking response of all three joints
given sinusoidal inputs. Note that responses shown are
produced simultaneously. For this experiment, the motor
velocity was held at a constant velocity sufﬁciently high to
satisfy the control requirements discussed in the previous
section. We note good tracking performance with error
generally conﬁned to 0:2
0
.
To demonstrate the tracking response at higher frequen-
cies, Fig. 11 shows the response of the third joint commanded
to track a 10 Hz sinusoid having a Pk-Pk amplitude of 10
0
.
Fig. 12 gives the response for a 17 Hz sinusoid with a
Pk-Pk amplitude of 5
0
. Although the tracking error begins
to degrade at higher frequencies, the results indicate the
capacity of the antagonistic MR actuator to operate at higher
frequencies.
VI. DISCUSSION
As we have shown, the DASA concept allows for a single
motor to drive multiple joints of a robot manipulator. As an

example of the design versatility of the DASA architecture,
we note that the motor installed in the 3-DOF robot is
intended for remote control hobby aircraft. Such low cost
motors can successfully drive multiple joints of a robot and
do not require any speciﬁc performance characteristic outside
of power output. The DASA approach is able to bridge the
high performance achieved by stiff joint-torque controlled
manipulators with the inherent safety of compliant actuators.
A limitation of the current design springs from the mass of
the clutches. Future work should focus on reducing the clutch
mass in order to improve safety characteristics.
