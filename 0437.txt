scheme to help managing and optimizing two critical activities 
in intermodal terminals, namely the containers allocation in the 
terminal yard and the freight trains composition. In particular, 
the focus of this paper is on the first problem and the goal is 
that of maximizing the utilization of the available space while 
keeping into account several constraints. The approach was 
successfully tested on a real case study, the rail-road terminal 
of a leading intermodal logistics company. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
Nowadays globalization, high productivity and rapid 
market changes require the standardization of the business 
processes in order to ensure added values for the whole 
supply chain [11]. An important link in the supply chain to 
allow efficiency, speed, reliability and environmental 
sustainability is represented by transportation. Recently, the 
transport market is moving towards intermodality and the 
standardized management of its operational processes and 
business flows has a high strategic value [5]. One of the key 
issues in the competitiveness of intermodal transport is the 
site (terminal) where the modal transshipping takes place. 
However, the configuration and the optimal control of an 
intermodal terminal is a very complex and challenging issue. 
In the existing optimization models for intermodal 
terminals, mathematical programming models are effective in 
representing the terminals characteristics and limitations. 
However, the relevant literature presents only few works 
aiming at optimizing inland (rail-road) terminals, with most 
contributions concerning seaport terminals and their 
peculiarities. Moreover, the few existing studies often 
disregard some operational aspects and practical issues, such 
as some containers characteristics, hence resulting of limited 
value for real applications. This paper aims to fill the gap by 
presenting a decision support scheme for the automation of 
intermodal freight transport companies, with regard to two of 
the main critical aspects: the yard management and the train 
load planning. This paper provides a solution to the first 
problem based on linear integer programming, and allows 
maximizing the utilization of the available space, keeping 
into account a series of constraints. A solution to the second

problem, still based on linear integer programming, has been 
recently proposed by some of the authors in [13]. 
The proposed approach was successfully tested on a real 
rail-road terminal of an Italian company operating in the 
intermodal transport in Europe, resulting in a useful tool to 
enhance the standardization of decisions, thanks to the 
integration with the enterprise software. 
II.  REVIEW ON INTERMODAL TRANSPORT 
OPTIMIZATION 
Since the emergence of intermodal transport, researchers 
have focused on analyzing, quantifying and valuing possible 
improvements in the freight transport [8, 25]. 
Referring to the problem of storage space allocation, it 
can be treated as a cutting and packing problem [14], or as a 
knapsack container loading problem [4] aiming at 
maximizing the filling of a virtual knapsack. However, in 
these cases some relevant constraints such as the orientation 
of the container, their weight or their stackability are usually 
neglected. In the related literature, strategies for locating 
containers in the yard have been discussed for different cases, 
mainly depending on the type of containers. In particular, 
import containers (those that arrive and, after having been 
stored for a particular time period until departure, are 
transferred to some other modality at the hinterland of the 
terminal) are studied in [19], presenting a method for 
determining both the optimal amount of storage space and the 
optimal number of yard cranes for handling these containers. 
Export containers (those that arrive at the terminal via other 
modes of transportation and, after staying at the yard, leave 
by ship) are addressed in [20, 21]. An approach covering both 
cases is proposed in [26], using a rolling horizon approach.  
A further classification of intermodal terminal 
optimization is based on the adopted approach and 
distinguishes among simulation, expert systems and analytic 
methods. Referring to the former class, in [15] a simulation 
model is developed to analyze the transshipment in a 
terminal, while in [23] a discrete event simulation model is 
proposed for minimizing the transshipment time of containers 
from trains placed on parallel tracks with a gantry crane, but 
without considering the limitations of platforms in the 
containers loading. In the context of expert systems, in [1] an 
expert system is developed for evaluating technological 
innovations in intermodal terminals. In [16] the authors 
propose a system based on the knowledge for approaching 
the programming of the vehicle load to be transported by 
train. In [3] an expert system is adopted combined with a 
simulation model to analyze a rail-road terminal with 
advanced equipments. Moreover, [22] proposes a genetic 
algorithm to determine the optimal storage strategy for 
various container handling schedules and in [9] the authors 
present a tabu search algorithm for the storage space 
allocation with side constraints. As regards analytic methods,

in [3] a model for approaching loading, unloading and 
storage of cranes in sea-road terminals is presented. In [24] 
the authors consider the management of a terminal used for 
the transshipment of vehicles by adopting analytic methods, 
but the obtained model is very complex, hence it is divided 
into sub-models and heuristics solutions are determined. In 
[6] and [18] the activities of containers managing, storing and 
handling in a terminal are approached, but both works 
disregard weight and dimension that have to characterize 
containers on each platform to allow an appropriate load. In 
[10] a load planning model is developed to dynamically 
assign containers to train slots at an intermodal terminal, with 
the objective to minimize handling time and optimize the 
mass distribution of the train, but by the simplifying 
assumption that all containers have the same length. 
However, in real cases differences and limitations in freight 
length, weight, balance or arrangement has to be addressed so 
that containers are correctly placed on wagons. 
Among the analytical models for intermodal terminals 
optimization, mathematical programming models may be 
effective in including real characteristics and limitations. 
However, despite the accepted prominence in terms of 
sustainability of rail transports with respect to other modes 
[12], most of the existing literature refers to seaport 
terminals. On the contrary, inland container terminals (i.e., 
without vessels or ships) is an important issue, as it combines 
the advantages of rail for long distance transportation with 
the higher penetration within the territory offered by road [6]. 
As concerns the rail transport optimization in intermodal 
terminals, in [7] the containers loading on trains are 
scheduled by means of a mixed integer linear programming 
model and with the aim of maximizing the allocation of 
containers to wagons and minimizing the overall transport 
costs within the terminal. In this model, for the first time, the 
weight characteristics of containers are taken into account. 
More recently, containers have been characterized, as well as 
by weight, also by their length and commercial value [2]. 
However, in rail-road terminals the minimization of the 
internal transport costs seems to be unnecessary, since costs 
associated with the traveled distances are not distinctive, but 
they are rather related to seaport terminals, where dimensions 
are much bigger. In addition, the model in [2] does not 
consider some relevant aspects, such as the presence of any 
kind of stringency in the containers delivery or the presence 
of some priority customer. Moreover, this model does not 
allow taking into account the train loading/unloading 
activities in the destination terminal, where containers may 
be relocated on a new train leaving for a subsequent 
destination. 
In the described context, inland intermodal terminal 
operators may require a decision support system that is suited 
to the real characteristics of the terminal in order to better 
manage both the critical phases of the container placement in 
the yard and the train load planning. 
In the following section we present a decision support 
scheme in which the optimization of the containers storage in 
the yard is obtained starting from the basic idea in [14] by 
adding the existing constraints on weight and stackability, 
while the train load model presented in [13] is developed 
from the one in [2] and improved for use in real cases. 
III. THE DECISION SUPPORT SCHEME 
In this paper we consider a rail-road terminal where 
containers continuously arrive and should either be 
immediately loaded on a train directed to a well precise 
destination, or temporarily stored in the terminal yard, 
before being loaded on a train. Our goal is twofold: first, we 
want to determine optimal compositions of trains; second, 
we want to optimize the storage of containers in the yard. A 
series of properties are associated with each container: 
destination, delivery date, and commercial value. When 
computing the train composition we try to ensure the 
greatest profit while respecting the existing constraints on 
containers and wagons size, containers weight, wagons 
capacity, containers type (rigid, tank or soft top), filling level 
(full or empty), the presence of any kind of stringency in the 
containers delivery, the presence of some priority customer 
for the company, so as to weigh the commercial value of the 
container by the impact on the overall value of the train 
composition. 
The proposed optimization is performed both at a local 
terminal level and at a global transport supply chain level. 
Moreover, either in case of subsequent changes (e.g., for a 
new stringency) or in case of loaded containers that are 
initially loaded but afterwards discarded (e.g., for safety 
reasons, due to the low computational time of the model) the 
optimization can be easily performed again, hence allowing 
a simple management of this phase. A train load planning 
optimization technique is proposed in [13]. 
Containers that are not immediately departing or have 
not been loaded on the train due to overbooking must be 
stored in the yard. This is done with the objective of 
maximizing the filling level of the available space in the 
yard while respecting any existing physical constraints on 
size, weight and stacking, which vary according to the type 
of container. Further, it is desirable that, if the stacking is 
feasible, containers with a farther departure date are placed 
below those departing before. The model also allows 
deciding whether to replace stored containers, e.g., as their 
delivery date is forthcoming, so as to avoid that they are 
placed below others. To simplify the subsequent trains’ 
composition, the yard is assumed to be divided into different 
zones, each of predetermined dimensions, according to the 
different target locations. In this way each area is designed 
to receive only containers to be loaded on the same train, 
ensuring transit routes to forklifts in the yard. Consequently, 
it is necessary to apply the model to each zone in which the 
yard is divided. 
In this paper we propose the decision support scheme in 
Fig. 1 that allows to jointly and recursively solve the above 
two optimization problems: the yard management and the 
train load planning.

The decision support scheme is based on the assumption 
that the company database associates a flag data
z
 to the 
generic container z with a given destination. The flag data
z
 
may take values in the set of natural numbers since no more 
than one train a day leaves for a given destination: if at a 
certain day it is data
z
=0 then the container z belongs to the 
list of containers departing in that day, if data
z
=q then the 
container belongs to the list of containers leaving after q 
days. The list of containers with data
z
=0 provides the input 
to the train composition problem. The output of such an 
optimization problem consists in the list of containers 
actually scheduled to be loaded on the considered train and 
their positions on the train wagons. According to the 
notation of Fig. 1, A is the list of flags associated with 
containers in the yard, while C
y
 is the list of flags associated 
with incoming containers. As shown in Fig. 1, only trains 
with data
z
=0 are considered in the step denoted as “optimize 
train composition”. Before solving the optimization 
problem, the presence of “new stringencies” is verified. If 
any, the optimization problem is updated accordingly. Note 
that the optimization also needs to be repeated when for any 
reason some container needs to be discarded. In Fig. 1 this 
case corresponds to a positive answer to the query “any 
loaded discarded?”. In the absence of new stringencies and 
discarded containers, the train composition is finally 
computed. On the other hand, all incoming containers such 
that data
z
≠0 are moved to the yard (see step “shift z from A 
to C
y
” in Fig. 1). The list of containers to be stored in the 
yard, that also includes the containers that are not loaded on 
the train even if data
z
=0, provides the input to the problem 
“optimize yard” that enables to obtain the yard composition. 
After that, the set A is updated accordingly. Note that also 
flags data
z
 need to be updated: in particular, flags associated 
with containers that were already considered in the train 
composition problem but have not been loaded on the train, 
keep their flag equal to 0, the other containers reduce their 
flag of one unit since the number of days before their 
departure decreases of one unit. 
 
IV. STORAGE OPTIMIZATION OF CONTAINERS                    
IN THE TERMINAL YARD 
In this section we discuss how it is possible to solve the 
problem of optimally storing containers in the terminal yard 
by a linear integer programming problem. The aim is to 
maximize the filling level of the available space while 
respecting the physical constraints on size and stacking 
(based on containers weight), which vary according to the 
type of container. Furthermore, it is desirable that, if the 
stacking is feasible, containers with a farther departure date 
are placed below those departing before. As seen above, to 
simplify the management of the departing trains 
composition, we assume that the yard is divided into 
different zones according to the target locations, and each 
area is divided into 5 feet slots. Moreover, for safety reasons 
no more than 4 containers can be stacked. Therefore, each 
area is rounded up to an integer number of available 
positions a, b and c. 
In the rest of the paper we use the following notation: 
•  C
y
 is the ordered set of n’ indices of incoming 
containers to be placed in the yard and having the same 
destination; 
•  A is the ordered set of m’ indices of containers already 
stored in the considered area with the same destination of C

it is not economically convenient to shift an already

wish to shift some of these containers, e.g., because their 
shipping date is upcoming and thus it is not beneficial to 
stack other containers on them. In such cases, by simply 
interfacing the model with the company software, it becomes 
very easy for the end user to reload the simulation also 
considering these containers and by treating them as if they 
have just been delivered in the yard.

The objective function allows maximizing the filling 
level of the available space in compliance with a set of 
constraints. 
Constraint (2.1) takes into account that each 20 feet 
container cannot be divided, and therefore occupies 4 slots 
that are necessarily adjacent (according to index i, so as to 
facilitate the subsequent load on the train, since this 
dimension is the one parallel to the rail tracks). Likewise for 
30 and 45 feet containers constraints (2.2) and (2.3) arise. 
Constraint (3) requires that to each position 
,, ijk
p no 
more than one container can be assigned. 
Constraint (4) requires that, for any value of j and k, the 
maximum number of occupied slots along i is equal to a. 
Similarly to the previous one, constraint (5) specifies 
that, for any value of i and k, the maximum number of 
occupied slots along j is equal to b. 
Constraint (6.1) requires that, for any value of i and j, the 
maximum number of rigid and full 20 feet containers along k 
is set to 3, for safety reasons in stacking, regardless of c. The 
same constraint applies also for rigid and full containers of 
other dimensions: see constraints (6.2) and (6.3). 
Constraint (7.1) requires that for any value of i and j, the 
maximum number of soft top and full 20 feet containers 
along k is 1, for safety reasons in stacking. Similarly, for soft 
top and full containers of other dimensions, (7.2) and (7.3) 
arise. 
Constraint (8.1) states that for any i and j, the maximum 
number of soft top and empty 20 feet containers along k is 3, 
for safety reasons. Similarly, for soft top and empty 
containers of other dimensions constraints (8.2) and (8.3) 
arise. 
Finally, constraint (9.1) requires that, for any value of i 
and j, the maximum number of rigid and empty 20 feet 
1974
  
container along k is set to 4, and similarly for containers of 
the same kind but with other dimensions constraints (9.2) 
and (9.3) arise. 
The above optimization problem has a number of binary

V. CASE STUDY 
The performance of the proposed model is evaluated by a 
real case study in the terminal located in Bari (Southern Italy) 
at “GTS - General Transport Service S.p.A.”, a leader in 
intermodal freight transport in Italy and Europe, owning 
about 1.800 containers of different types and 280 train 
wagons. The critical issues for the company are the lack of 
standardization in positioning containers in the yard and the 
lack of optimization criteria in the trains composition, as well 
as the lack of computerized tools enabling to have constantly 
updated reports on the large existing information and freight 
flows. Currently, both the container allocation in the yard and 
the train composition are manually decided by the 
corresponding operator, based on his personal experience and 
considering the physical constraints and factors such as the 
customer importance and reliability, the freight 
characteristics and the presence of fixed delivery dates or 
other contractual obligations.  
In order to facilitate their use by the employees, both the 
approach in the above section and the train composition 
approach in [13] have been implemented in the company 
software, which is based on MS Visual Studio, interfacing 
them with the business database by means of MS Excel 
spreadsheets. 
The first step of the proposed technique is to identify the 
best allocation for containers in the yard, so as to maximize 
its filling level in compliance with the existing constraints. 
Tables I and II respectively report the sets of containers to be 
placed in the yard (C
y
) and of those already stored (A), while 
Fig. 2 graphically depicts the starting situation of the area, 
reporting at each level the slots in which it is divided.

Figure 2.  The starting situation at level I (k=1), II (k=2) and III (k=3). 
All considered containers have the same destination, and 
the relative area in the yard has dimensions of approximately 
50x130 square feet. On the basis of the foregoing it follows 
that the available space is for about 6 rows of containers in 
depth, while there are 24 slots (5 ft each) in length and, as 
mentioned, no more than 4 containers can never be stacked in 
height, hence a=24, b=6 and c=4. 
The model has been implemented and solved in the 
MATLAB environment using the GLPK (Gnu Linear 
Programming Kit) optimizer tool [17]. Fig. 3 shows the 
obtained output, with a computational time of just about 30 
seconds on a Pentium 4 PC with a 1.92 GHz processor and 
512 MB of RAM, once the input data were loaded from the 
company database (it takes few minutes). 
From Fig. 3 it can be seen that containers having index 
z=102 was assigned to the position (1,5,2), i.e. above the one 
with index z=4, that is one of those of the same size and type, 
and similarly all containers are located with respect of the 
imposed constraints. Moreover, in case of more containers 
that can be placed in the same position, it is sufficient to sort 
them by departure date in a descending order, to place as 
first, and hence below the others, those departing later. 
The procedure in [13] has been subsequently applied to 
determine the train composition and the optimal load 
1975
  
planning. Results are not reported here for brevity 
requirements. Once the train composition phase is over, all 
discarded containers can be placed in the storage area, by 
rerunning the yard composition model. In this way, these 
containers, which are characterized by a closer departure 
date, will be placed on top of the others, making it easier to 
load them on the next train composition.

Overall, the management of both phases by means of the 
proposed tool takes approximately 5 minutes, most of which 
are needed to import the input data from the corporate 
database. Hence, once data is imported, a new optimization 
problem (e.g., with different constraints) may be actually 
solved in less than 1 minute. 
VI. CONCLUSIONS 
We propose a support decision scheme for optimizing two 
critical issues at intermodal company rail terminals: the 
allocation of containers in the yard (maximizing the filling 
level) and the composition of freight trains (maximizing the 
company profit). We fill the gap found in the related 
literature that typically considers optimization models for 
seaport terminals only. We also present an approach based on 
linear integer programming to solve the yard composition 
problem, while the train composition and load planning 
problem is solved using an approach presented by some of 
the authors in [SMC]. The model has been tested on a real 
case study and, thanks to the short computational times, it 
guarantees a high flexibility.
