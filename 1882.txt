AbstractÑKinematic planning for robotic arms has been
shown to be capable of planning for robust manipulation
of static objects. However, this approach falls short when
manipulating moving objects such as picking up a jar off of
a conveyor belt at a bottling plant. The challenge in carefully
picking up moving objects is that these actions require motions
that do not involve large decelerations, to avoid jerking the
object, as well as Þguring out the proper time in which
the object can be picked up. We present a search-based
kinodynamic motion planning algorithm that generates a time-
parameterized trajectory for both the arm and end-effector,
capableof carefullypickinguptheobjectat theearliestfeasible
point in its trajectory. To combat the high-dimensionality of
the time-parameterized kinodynamic planning problem, our
approach employs informative heuristics and adaptive dynamic
motion primitives. To validate our approach, we used a 7DOF
manipulator on Willow GarageÕs PR2 robot to pickup objects
off of a conveyor belt. We also provide a detailed set of results
that demonstrate the plannerÕs ability to generate consistent,
low cost trajectories for manipulation.
I. INTRODUCTION
A major goal in the Þeld of industrial automation is to
performpickandplacetasksusingroboticstechnologywhen
possible. Today, manipulators are being used in factories for
many such tasks, including bin picking, box moving and the
kitting of packages. A common theme among all of these
tasks is that the robot arm is manipulating objects that are at
rest.Themanipulationofstaticobjectsiswellresearchedand
multiple approaches have been presented in the last decade
that are fast and provento be reliable. However,autonomous
manipulation of moving objects poses new challenges to all
pieces of the system - includingmotion planningfor the arm
and grasp planning for the end-effector.
Picking up moving objects is a challenging planning
problem because kinematic path planning approaches that
are used to manipulate static objects are no longer viable.
The naive approach in which a kinematic planner for the
arm is coupled with a grasp planner for the end-effector,
leaves many questions unanswered. These questions include
what shouldthe timingofthe trajectorybe as well as at what
time should the object be grasped in its trajectory. Another
problemthatarisesisforasmoothandcarefulpickupmotion
to be performed, a grasping motion that tracks the velocity
of the object until itÕs complete is required. Alternatively, if
grasping the object is a jerky and abrupt motion that begins
at rest, it may not be feasible to accelerate to the proper
velocity in time for the pickup, causing a mishandling of

the object. Such an action may be acceptable in a situation
in which the objects being manipulated are rigid or robust
to mishandling, however, in this paper we are presenting an
approach that is capable of dealing with durable objects as
well as fragile ones that require careful manipulation.
In this work, we show how the framework of search-
based planning can be used to deal with the challenges de-
scribed above. More speciÞcally, we present a kinodynamic
motion planning algorithm that is capable of generating
time-parameterized trajectories for the entire pickup motion
of a moving object. To generate these trajectories, motion
planning is performed in a statespace that includes time
in addition to the joint positions and joint velocities of
the manipulator. This results in a very high dimensional
statespace when planning for a state of the art robotic arm.
In our approach, we systematically construct a graph and
search it with an anytime variant of heuristic search, known
as ARA* [1]. The algorithm uses a set of dynamically fea-
sible motion primitives to construct a graph in which, every
edgeis a validmotionwith respect to the torquelimits of the
manipulatorand acceleration constraints given by the object.
To dealwith theadditionalcomplexityposedby thegrasping
problem, we present an adaptive dynamic motion primitive,
a primitive that is generated on-the-ßy, that is capable of
planning a dynamically feasible grasp for the object. To
guide the search, we use a fast to compute heuristic that
aids the search by providing valuable information regarding
the complexities of the velocity and acceleration limits of

II. RELATED WORK
Amanipulationpipelineforpickingupmovingobjectshas
beenshowntoconsistentlypickupobjectssuccessfullyoffof
a conveyor belt even at high speeds [2]. In this approach, a
kinematic search-based planner is used to plan to a pregrasp
pose. From there, using an open loop inverse-kinematics
based grasp-motion, starting from rest, the grasp is executed
at the calculated time. A drawbackis the open loop grasping
motion may be unsafe or not synchronizedproperly with the
objectÕsmotion.Theapproachwedescribeinthispaperplans
a smooth motion, tracking the objectÕs motion as the gripper
encloses it, giving it the capability to manipulate objects too
fragile to be pickedup with an abruptscoopingmotion,such
as a glass of water.
Another manipulation pipeline uses a combination of
optical ßow and a robust control strategy to produce arm
motion that synchronizes to the motion of the object [3].
Our approach differs in that we seek to produce a feasible
plan, accounting for kinematic feasibility in the environment
and differing object geometries for manipulation, while pro-
ducing a smoother pickup.
Forpickingupamovingobject,apurelykinematicplanner
is insufÞcient because the solution is a time parametrized
trajectory. The problem is kinodynamic since there is a need
to account for manipulator limits on velocity and torque.
Time parametrized planning in the kinodynamic state-space
is challenging due to the large number of dimensions, as
wellas anunboundedtimedimension.Oneset ofapproaches
that is robust to the curse of dimensionality is sampling
based planners, such as RRT [4] or its variant RRT? [5].
Bidirectional RRTÕs are not applicable here since the goal
state is partially deÞned. Even with forward search however,
the goal state is degenerate (can be at any time, and at
any arm conÞguration) which makes biasing the sampling
towards the goal not as clear-cut. Additionally, for RRT?
the rewiring step requires solving a two-point boundary
value problem, which is challenging to solve in the case of
redundant manipulators. Other approaches to kinodynamic
planning include planning in a modiÞed conÞguration space
that accounts for the motion of obstacles [6], a hybrid
approach that leverages graph-search and sampling-based
planners [7], or algebraically constructing the solution [8].
These algorithms however are limited to lower dimensional
problems.
Kinodynamic planning has been framed as a time-optimal
control problem, for a given kinematic path [9], [10].
Extensions to this address different path parametrizations
[11], and dealing with velocity and torque limits [12] or
dynamic singularities [13] . These papers do not address
the completeness since combining a kinematic path planner
with retiming for kinodynamic constraints are independent
steps.Apossiblesolutionistocombinetheretimingstepand
planning in conÞguration space, while including dynamic
constraints[14].Alternatively,insteadoftime-optimaltrajec-
tories, safety-optimal trajectories which minimize the likeli-
hood of failure, under uncertainty, were found by searching
for a kinodynamic policy [15]. Neither of these approaches
have considered search for time-parametrized trajectories
where the goal is moving.
III. KINODYNAMIC MOTION PLANNING
ALGORITHM
The kinodynamic motion planning problem presented in
this paper is to pick up a moving object such as a bottle
on a conveyor belt. Using prior knowledge of the objectÕs
trajectory,as well as a manuallyselected grasponthe object,
we generate a trajectory for the manipulator that is kino-
dynamically feasible by constructing and searching a graph
using motion primitives that are predeÞned or generated on-
the-ßy. The trajectory generated minimizes time taken to
retrieve the object (we consider the object retrieved if it is
grasped and stationary).
We divide the motion plan into three phases which are
differentiated based on the pose of end-effector with respect
to the object:
¥ Reaching: end-effector is not close to the object, and
the manipulator is moving to position the end-effector
at the object.
¥ Grasping: end-effector is moving from near the object
to contact with the object, and tracking it to secure its
hold on the object. In this phase the manipulator needs
to keep the relative position of the end effector and the
object the same, otherwise the object would slip out of
grasp.
¥ Lifting: the end-effector has achieved a stable grasp of
the object which allows it to move the object as if it
were rigidly attached. Here the manipulator would be
free to move in space, or it could be constrained to the
special dynamics of the object, such as a ßuid Þlled
container not being jerked.
Our planner performs a single search that Þnds a solution
for all three phases, and solves for the least-time trajectory.
The search is done in the space of joint angles, velocities,
and in time in order to Þnd a kinodynamicallyfeasible time-
parametrized trajectory that picks up the moving object. As
discussed in Section II, existing techniques to kinodynamic
planning are inapplicable because of the two-point boundary
value problem and the degeneracy of the goal state.
We employ a graph search for Þnding the time
parametrized trajectory as described below. As with any
graph search it can be split into four parts: graph con-
struction, cost function, heuristic function and the search
algorithm itself.
A. Graph Construction
We represent the planning problem by an underlying
lattice structure which is a discretization of the kinodynamic
conÞguration-space into a set of states S and connections
between the states E. This allows us to employ graph search
algorithms for Þnding a motion plan. Using the notation,
G = (S,E) to describe the graph we search over, S
454
represents the state-space of the search and E represents the
possible transitions between states.
For our speciÞc task, the state-space S consists of the
robot joint conÞgurations, joint velocities, time. A candidate
state s = (?

,t) is then a tuple of
discretized joint positions, velocities, and time. A dynamic
environment naturally pirecludes the inclusion of time as a
search dimension.
The transitions between states, E, consist of two sets of
motion primitives which are E
delta
and E
grasp
.

object and intercepting it. A successor state is generated by
numerically integrating under these acceleration proÞles for
a Þxed time-step from the current state. We integrate using

and ? is the n?1 vector of joint torques.
E
grasp
is a set of adaptive motion primitives [16] that
uses Jacobian pseudoinverse control to generate a collision-
free, dynamically feasible trajectory of the arm that brings
the hand in close contact with the object and maneuvers
the hand from cradling the object to securely holding the
object. This achieves the sub-task of grasping the object.
The motion primitive is designed to produce a grasp on the
object that is manually determined to work on the object
being manipulated, i.e. we hand-pick the grasp and pregrasp
pose for the object. As an side note, we bundle lifting sub-
task into E
grasp
in the planner by appending a waypoint
that lifts the object, and it can generated either by motions
produced through E
delta
or Jacobian pseudoinverse control.
Inourexperiments,we use oneofthe PR2Õs end-effectors,
a two Þngered pincher, to pickup cylindrical objects. In
this case, the set of candidate grasps are the poses radially
arranged around the main axis of the cylindrical object.
The motion primitives of E
grasp
is agnostic to the grasp
desired, and the set of motion primitives that are included
in E
grasp
can be expanded to include ranked grasps from
grasp-tables, provided appropriate grasp trajectories can be
generated using a jacobian motion from the pregrasp pose.

the gripper closes around the object, in Figure 3c. A sample
generated gripper trajectory with respect to the object is
shown in Figure 2.
After the trajectory is generated, a spline is Þtted to the
trajectory to get a time parameterizationthat we can validate
easily for infeasible joint torques, velocities, and collisions
with the moving goal. Collisions with static obstacles, and
joint limits are handled duringthe rollout of the trajectory.If
the trajectory is invalidated for any of the reasons provided,
we discard it and move on to testing other pregrasp poses
and times for feasible grasp motions.
If a feasible trajectory traj is found, this constitutes a
validedgeandthesuccessorstateislabeledasoneofthegoal
states. Thecost ofthis edgeis set to the cost ofthe trajectory
for the motion primitive, i.e. duration of the jacobian motion
and pregrasp motion.
If the set of candidate pregrasp states is exhausted, no
successors are generated by E
grasp
.
B. Cost Function
The goal of the cost function is to minimize the execution
time to complete the entire pickup task. Therefore the cost
of each motion primitive in E
delta
is the time computed by
the forward-integrationof the dynamics of the arm. The cost
of a motion primitive in E
grasp
is the time taken to perform
all three components - pregrasping, grasping, and tracking.
Additionally the time for lifting is accounted for in this.
C. Heuristic
The purpose of a heuristic function is to improve the
efÞciencyof the searchbyguidingit in promisingdirections.
Heuristic-based search algorithms require that the heuristic
function is admissible (underestimating the cost to goal) and
consistent [20]. A typical method for formulating a heuristic
istousetheresultsfromasimpliÞedproblem,suchasfroma
lower-dimensional version of a similar search problem. This
is usually achieved by relaxing some of the constraints of
the original problem. The heuristic needs to capture the key
complexities of the problem at hand to efÞciently guide the
searchinthemostinformativeway.Inourproblem,wefound

directly gives us ?t

An important step in Algorithm 2, is the check whether

then the object can be

can be chosen
as the time till the object leaves the robot workspace. At
which point the heuristic can only return inÞnite costs to the
goal.
To compute ?t
grasp
, we account for the time taken to
grasp and lift the object. Since we use a control policy to
generate the motion primitive, we set a nominal time which
approximates least time it would take to grab the object, i.e.
the time to close the gripper. The time to lift the object is
also a constant time, which is added to the gripper closing
time to give ?t
grasp
.
The summation of ?t
reach
and ?t
grasp
gives us our
heuristic estimate for the current state in the search,

.
In order to select the bounded end-effector velocity v
e

,
we choose a v
e

that is the the fastest we can move the
end effector in the workspace, while respecting the joint
velocity limits. To do this, we maximize

a bounding box in the space of joint velocities. Since the
Jacobian of the arm J is afÞne, we can check the same

Equation (4) and select the highest norm for our estimate
of v
e

. Using Equation (5) by permuting each

whether
it is a maximum or a minimum for the index i, we compute
thecorrespondingworkspacevelocityandÞndthemaxspeed

Since this maximum v
e
max
is dependent on the conÞgura-
tion ? as seen in (4), as a preprocessing step, we test a large
number of arm conÞgurations to get an estimate for the top
speed of the end-effector in the workspace. The approach to
Þndingtheboundonthelinearacceleration,a
e

,oftheend
effector is similarly done to [21]. However for our purposes
the acceleration bound is calculated on a stationary arm.
D. Search
We use the anytime variant of A?, ARA?, to search
a graph G for the solution. ARA? tries to Þnd the best
solution it can within the given time period. Beginning with
an initial suboptimal solution, the algorithm improves the
solution while deliberation time remains. ARA? is complete
for the given graph G and has theoretical bounds on on sub-
optimality of solutions. Using an inßated heuristic, by?³ 1,
the graph-searchreduces with time the ? to 1, at which point
the return solution is the least cost path.
IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
Ourexperimentalanalysisincludestwo components.First,
we present a battery of tests in simulation to measure the
computational performance of the planner. Then we present
experiments on an actual robot in which it picks up moving
objects. The purpose of the two stage analysis is that it
is difÞcult to assess whether the robot successfully grasped
the object or not in our simulated environment. In addition,
without object detection and perception in the test setup on
the actual robot, the process of performing a large battery
of tests becomes tedious and time consuming. Instead, we
performed a large set of planning requests in simulation to
benchmark the performance and robustness of the planner
and a small subset of those were repeatedonthe actual robot
to verify the success of the grasping motions and included
in the attached video. We performed all of our experiments
on Willow GarageÕs PR2 robot.

A. Simulation
Our performance tests were run in simulation on a com-
puterrunningUbuntu11.10withanIntelCore2QuadQ9550
CPU (2.83Ghz) with 6GB of RAM. We generated a set of
112 tests, each with initial object poses varying in their
position in xy on the conveyor belt. In all of these tests,
the belt speed is set to 0.1m/s, we are planning for the right
arm, and the object that is being grasped is a soda can. The
initial poses of the object are each separated by 2cm in a
14cm by 26cm rectangle. In Figure 5, the initial poses are
displayed as blue and red dots and the belt moves along the
direction of the arrow. The initial joint conÞguration of the
right arm is the same for all experimentsand can be partially
seen in the Þgure.
In each of these trials, the planner is given an allocated
planning time of 30 seconds and if a solution is not found it
is considered a planning failure. Of the 112 tests performed,
the planner successfully computed plans for 110 of them,
yielding a success rate of 98.2%. In Table I we present a
summary of the successful planning requests. In each test,
the initial ? = 100 and the reported results are computed
using the Þrst solution found.

In these experiments, we use a basic set of motion
primitives for E
delta
in which each joint is accelerated one
at a time. We chose this set because they provide a dense
coverage of the workspace. However, more complicated
acceleration proÞles can be used in E
delta
. We state the
values of the joint velocities in radians per second squared
and ?t in seconds. The actual motion primitives in E
delta
that were used in these experiments are listed in Table II.

our experiments performed on the PR2 that would result in
the most consistent pickups. The E

B. PR2 Experiments
In experiments on the PR2 we use its left arm to place an
object on the conveyor and right arm for the delicate pickup
of the object. This imitated a scenario where the motion of
theobjectis detectedperfectlyusingexternalsensorssuchas
laser range Þnders arrayed along the conveyor. The velocity
of the object is known to the PR2 (and planner). During the
experiment the object is initially held slightly above the belt
in the left hand at its set initial pose. The left gripper then
opens, placing the object on the moving belt, and triggers
the execution of the planned path.
For our experiments, we chose objects that would help
demonstrate the smoothness of the planned motion. The
objects we used include a soda can, martini glass and a
toy bird balancing on a pointed stand mounted to the top
of another soda can. Screenshots of the objects in the video
canbeseeninFigure6.Notethatthemartiniglassisdouble-
walled with clear liquid inside that is free to move around.
The placidity of the liquid during the pickup gives a sense
of how smooth the planned trajectory is. The same is true
with the balancing bird. In the accompanying video, the toy
birdÕs weighted beak makes it adept at balancing on its tip
however it fails to maintain its balance given jerky or abrupt
motions.
V. DISCUSSION
Currently in our implementation E
grasp
is only one kind
of motion, that uses Jacobian pseudoinverse control. This is
not exhaustive in the space of possible pregrasp motions,
for manipulators with more complicated hands, and for
redundant manipulators. E
grasp
uses a controller whose
gains are not automatically determined by the planner, and
hence requires some manual conÞguration to produce a set
of feasible grasping motions. The grasp poses are limited to
cylindrical objects due to their simplicity.

AdditionallyE
delta
is lacking sleep motionprimitives, i.e.
motionprimitivesthat bringthe arm to rest. These primitives
would enable the planner to deal with objects that do not
enter the manipulator workspace for a long time.
The planner may not compute a trajectory in real time if
the object is too close to the robot, from our experimental
results. A feasible use-case is precomputinga library of such
plans,which canbe indexedbasedonthe objectpositionand
trajectoryforavarietyofscenarios.Planneroptimizationsare
the next step for us to improve its applicability to real time
scenarios.
Possible extensions to the planner to improve its applica-
bility also include closed loop planning. Formulating it as
an incremental search problem (dynamic replanning) may
enable the use of object trajectory feedback.
VI. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper we have presented a search-based kinody-
namic motion planning algorithm that is capable of generat-
ingtime-parameterizedtrajectoriestopickupmovingobjects.
Our approach generates a smooth trajectory, capable of
matching the velocity of the object throughout the grasping
motion while being feasible with respect to joint torques
and velocity limits. To efÞciently deal with the high dimen-
sionality of the planning problem, we introduced adaptive
dynamic motion primitives, which are motions generated on
the ßy that use jacobian pseudoinverse control to simplify
the planning of the grasping motion. The algorithm relies
on an anytime graph search to generate solutions quickly,
as well as to provide consistency and theoretical guarantees
on the completeness, consistency and provides a bounds on
the suboptimality of the solution cost. The search is guided
efÞciently by an informative heuristic that aids in coping
with the velocity and acceleration limits of the arm. Our
video and experimental results demonstrate the success of
the approach, however, for it to be used in real time, further
optimization is needed.
