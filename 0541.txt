1 Abstract—To propose a synchronous and multi-domain 
feature extraction method of electroencephalogram (EEG) and 
surface electromyogram (sEMG) signals is of great significance 
to power-assist rehabilitation robot control with human-
computer interface (HCI). In this paper, nonnegative Tucker 
decomposition which is one model of nonnegative tensor 
factorization (NTF) is used to fuse two kinds of bioelectricity 
signals (EEG and sEMG) and extract multi-domain features of 
EEG and sEMG signals for classification which contain time, 
frequency, and space domains. In the first step the EEG and 
sEMG data are transformed into multidimensional information 
using continuous wavelet transform and the 4-D EEG-sEMG 
tensor is established. Then the tensor is decomposed into four 
components (spatial components, spectral components, 
temporal components and category components) and the core 
tensor is the feature extracted. The feature after being 
eliminated and compressed are fed into KNN, LDA and SVM 
classifiers for pattern recognition, and a comparison is done in 
single EEG analysis, single sEMG analysis and both EEG and 
sEMG analysis. An experiment about 10 healthy participants’ 
upper limb movements was carried out to verify the validity of 
this algorithm. The result implied that NTF is a meaningful and 
valuable synchronous and multi-domain feature extraction 
method which may be promising in power-assist rehabilitation 
robot control. 
I. INTRODUCTION  
CCORDING to the World Health Organization, stroke 
is one of the major diseases which seriously threaten 
humans health and more than half of the stroke patients 
suffer from hemiplegia [1]. Clinical trials prove that through 
timely rehabilitation training, the motor function of most 
stroke patients can be recovered gradually and even healed. 
Recent years, the technology of hemiplegia rehabilitation 
assisted by robot has been  introduced and gradually acquir-
ed the recognition of doctors and researchers. Various types 
of rehabilitation robots have been developed to assist phy-
sicians, which have improved the recovery efficiency sig-
nifycantly [2, 3]. However, most of these rehabilitation 
robots are no-power or simple mechanism with movement 
fixed, and the subjective intention and rehabilitation status of 
patients are ignored. The weakness of lacking flexibility and 
adaptability in robot control limits the application of 
rehabilitation robot. With the ideas of human-computer

interface (HCI) appearing, human-centred design of power-
assist rehabilitation robot has already become the hotspot of 
research and front field [4]. 
sEMG signals which represent neuromuscular activity are 
effective biological index for expressing movement intention 
and obtaining muscular system information. EMG-based HCI 
have been widely used in rehabilitation. For example, Osamu 
proposed  a sEMG-control method based on log-linearized 
Gaussian mixture network (LLGMN) which assisted the 
patient’s limb motion [5] and a neuromuscular method based 
on muscle reflex was proposed by Wu to control rehahili-
tation robot [6]. It is of great importance to find methods for 
decoding intended action from sEMG signals and extracting 
the feature information from sEMG accurately. Healthy 
people’s sEMG signals can primely reflect the motion 
movement intention, however, for stroke patients with hemi-
plegia, the contraction and strength of affected side muscle 
are very faint which makes the sEMG so weak that it’s 
difficult to acquire the movement intention of patient. What’s 
more, the sEMG under dynamic movement is non-stationary 
and transient, which also brings difficult to motion reco-
gnition. EEG is considered, therefore,  to be combined with 
the sEMG.   
EEG is the reflection of electrophysiological activity from 
a group of nerve cells, which contains numerous physiolo-
gical information. EEG  from the cortical region of motion 
perception will have a corresponding change when people 
perform motor and control information from operator’s 
intention can be obtained by analyzing EEG, in order to 
control object. Brain-computer interfaces (BCI) technology 
in rehabilitation robot has shown impressive progress in the 
last few years. Yoshikatsu used the cross-correlation func-
tions of EEG to drive assistive robotic system [7], and the 
power density of frequency bands from the EEG are used by 
Ela as features to control the robot after classifing using 
LDA [8]. These robots with BCI technology are humanized 
and innovative, but the recognition rate still cannot meet the 
demand of precisely control. Nevertheless, more and more 
evidences suggest that there are complex mapping relations 
between EEG and sensory-cognitive processes, so studys on 
multichannel EEG signals and EEG-sEMG synchronous 
analysis are particularly important, especially for the central 
nerves injury patients with movement disorder. 
From the above, the strategy integrating sEMG and EEG 
signals can avoid the disadvantages of single sEMG or 
single EEG strategy, however, few relevant researches in 
this field have been published at present, particularly in 
rehabilitation robot study. Armando designed a EEG-EMG

applying amplitude thresholds and PSD which obtained a 
better result than the previous [9]. Robert fused the16-
channel EEG and 4-channel EMG by Bayesian method to 
classify left and right hand movements, which was comfirm-
ed to be better than classification only relied on EEG or 
sEMG [10]. 
In view of the above mentioned problem, this paper 
presents a synchronous and multi-domain feature extraction 
method of EEG and sEMG in upper-limb rehabilitation robot 
which is the signal processing part of rehabilitation robot 
system (Fig 1). In this study, we first use nonnegative Tucker 
decomposition (NTD) [11] which is one model of nonnega-
tive tensor factorization (NTF) to extract multi-domain fea-
tures of sEMG and EEG signal simultaneously for classify-
cation. Firstly, we pretreat the acquired sEMG and EEG 
signals and construction the spectral tensor by wavelet 
transform. Then the feature tensor is obtained by decompos-
ing using NTD. Futhermore, the sEMG-EEG feature is 
classified by KNN, LDA and SVM. An experiment was con-
ducted to confirm the validity and high performance of the 
algorithm. 
II.    MATERIALS AND METHODS 
A. Subjects 
A sample of 10 subjects (6 males and 4 females) was 
recruited in this study. Subjects’ ages ranged from 20 to 30 
years old (mean? standard deviation [SD], 25.2? 2.3y). All 
subjects were healthy without previous problems in nerve or 
physiology. 
B. Instrumentation 
During  the  experiments, EEG and sEMG were digitized 
simultaneously at a sampling frequency of 1kHz by a data 
acquisition equipment with a 16-bit Analogue-to-Digital 
converter and an amplifier (1000? ). The scalp EEG signals 
of 32 channels referenced  to  the  common  linked  electro-
des  at  the earlobes  were  recorded. Signals  from  C3, C4, 
CP3, CP4,  which  represent the sensorimotor cortex  were  
selected  for  further  investigation. Two-channel sEMG with 
the 5-500Hz bandwidth were acquired simultaneously  during  
the  task. The participants were asked to do particular move-
ments to find these target muscles (biceps brachii (BB) and 
triceps brachii (TB) or flexor carpi ulnaris and extensor carpi 
radialis). The signals were acquired using Ag-AgCl dispos-
able sEMG electrodes, the diameter of which was 15mm. 
Two surface electrodes were connecters in two differential 
configurations separately placed on the bulge of the muscle 
with a reference electrode at the elbow. The arrangement 
ensured that two electrodes were along with the muscle fiber 
and the inter-center-electrode distance was 20mm. The skin 
at the electrodes sites were prepared by shaving and rubbing 
with alcohol. Fixing the lead wires appropriately in order to 
decrease the interference which dangling wires brought. The 
off-line data were further processed and analyzed using 
Matlab2011a. 
C. Data acquisition 
The test was performed with the subject sitting, and the 
elbow joint of dominant arm at the edge of the bench. The 
EEG and sEMG data were then recorded at 6 movement 
conditions- wrist flexion, wrist extension, fingers flexion, 
fingers extension, elbow flexion and elbow extension. For 6 
movement conditions, each subject performed 4-sec long 
action ten times with 4-sec of rest in between. 1200 data sets 
of EEG and 600 sets of sEMG were recorded in total. The 
same procedure was repeated for each subject and condition 
(Fig.2). We cut the trials into 8s segments and manually dis-
carded the  segments  trials  contaminated  with sensor jumps.

D. Nonnegative tensor factorization 
(a) NTF 
Nonnegative tensor factorization (NTF) is an effective 
approach to extract features of high-dimensional data. It is a 
multiway extension of nonnegative matrix factorization 
(NMF). Hidden latent characteristics in data structures can 
be extracted using this method. Ideally, the features extract-
ed by NTF have the character of nonnegative and sparse, 
which ensures the physical significance of features and 
benefits the local feature extraction. A multiway array is 
regarded as a tensor. A vector is a 1-order tensor, a matrix is 
a 2-order tensor, and a cube is a 3-order tensor. One of the 
most promising factorization of NTF is the nonnegative 
Tucker decompositions (NTD).

E. Data analysis 
(c) Pretreated 
EEG and sEMG signals are very weak, inevitably 
contaminated by the presence of artifacts. Such as  EOG, 
inadequate skin-electrode contacts, baseline drift, low-
frequency movement artifact, the power line interference 
(50Hz and its higher harmonics), etc. In order to remove any 
artifact, a scheme of pretreatment was designed in this study. 
An adaptive high-pass filter (digital 8th-order Butterworth) 
was used to remove baseline drift and movement artifacts 
were isolated by 0.5-75Hz(EEG) and 0.1-200Hz(sEMG) 
band-pass filters (digital 8th-order Butterworth). The power 
line interference and EOG were suppressed using Indepen-
dent Component Analysis (ICA). Examples of pretreated 
signals are depicted in Figure 4.

The method of NTF needs the tensor more than 2 
coordinates, however, EEG and sEMG signals acquired by 
the equipment are both stored in the form of one dimensional 
data in time domain. In order to use NTF to analysis multi-
domain features including EEG and sEMG, multichannel 
and multisubject, time-frequency-space domain and multi-
way classification, the data should be transformed into 
multi-dimensional information and the EEG-sEMG tensor 
should be established first.

Fig.5. 4-D tensor construction and visualization of EEG and sEMG data. 
Transformation of signals into the time-frequency domain 
is a standard technique to augment dimensionality. All the 
EEG and sEMG signals were transformed into the time-
frequency domain using the complex Morlet wavelets 
CMOR6-1 with the bandwidth parameter fb=6 Hz, and the 
wavelet center frequency fc=1 Hz. Since the movement 
conditions have significant correlation with the energy of 
sEMG and EEG, the modulus of wavelet coefficient is 
selected as the representation of time-frequency character.

The data for each trial formed a 3-D spectral tensor with the 
modes of 4 channels ? 200 frequencies ? 8000 times. Take 
left elbow movement for example (so does the following 
part), BB muscles and the TB muscles are two sEMG 
channels, C4 and CP4 are two EEG channels, and elbow 
flexion and elbow extension are two classes. Hence, the full 
data is a 4-D tensor of size 4 channels ? 200 frequencies ? 
8000 times ? 2 classes. Fig.5 shows the procedure of 
transformation.  
For classification, the whole data set is divided into 2 
parts. That means the training data Ytr is a 4-D tensor of 60 
sub-tensors for each subject and two classes (elbow flexion 
and elbow extension) : 4 ? 200 ? 8000 ? 2. The test data is 
140 sub-tensors Yts of 4 ? 200 ? 8000 ? 2. 
(d) Feature extraction and classification 
In order to extract features from spectral tensor, we 
decompose the 4-D training tensor Ytr along its first three 
dimensions to find 3 basis factors for spatial components, 
spectral components and temporal components. Features of a 
3-D tensor are coefficients of this tensor in the subspace 
spanned by estimated basis which are expressed by the core 
tensor in the NTD [13].

Then, the Laplacian Tensor Discriminant Analysis [14] is 
employed to further eliminate redundant features, and the

Fig.6. Tensor factorization for the training data and projection of the test 
data to extract features 
A trial has in total 4 ? 45 ? 36 features which are still 
large and redundant for classification. In fact, Fisher scores 
are selected to seek dominant features, and then, leading 
Fisher feature is identified as the feature extracted which are 
available to train a classifier and predict labels for test data. 
Classifiers: KNN, LDA and SVM are used to evaluate the 
classification performance. The whole steps are showed in 
Fig.6. 
III. RESULTS 
First, the 4-D tensor of size 4 channels ? 200 frequencies 
? 8000 times ? 2 classes is decomposed by NTD to show the 
meaning of each component. Four factor matrices in the 
space, frequency, time, and class domains are shown in the 
figure. The first column represents the channel (spatial) 
component, which is described by the brain electrical act-
ivity mapping (BEAM) and topographic map of power 
spectrum of sEMG. The component in the second, third, and 
fourth columns are the frequency (spectral) component, time 
(temporal) component and class (category) component. The 
result shows the weight coefficients on each component. In 
Fig.7, component 1 mainly corresponds to BB muscle from 
the muscle maps of arm, and the fourth column of com-
ponent 1 has larger amplitude in class 1. Component 2 
indicates that the spatial amplitude distribution is lower on 
the left hemisphere than the right, and the centre of  the 
distribution is around CP4 which is considered to be related 
with class 1 showed in column 4. So these two components 
are recognized as the elbow flexion condition. Similarly, 
component 3 illustrates the movement condition with a 
spatial distribution of larger amplitude on the TB muscle and 
lower amplitude on the BB muscle, hence the larger amp-
litude in class 2 and lower amplitude in class 1. Therefore, 
the component 3 represents elbow extension condition. From 
the figure we can see that component 4  also belongs to class 
2, however, the BEAM of component 4 doesn’t have signi-
ficant different with component 2. In addition, there is a 
phenomenon that the peak of spectrum of component 1 is 
mainly in the 80-100 Hz frequency band; however, that is 
40-60 Hz in component 3. Component 2 has a little wider 
frequency band than component 4 at the same time.

There is another method to do the decomposion that the 
time and frequency domains can be reshaped and combined 
into one dimension. A 3-order tensor with the size 4? 
1600000? 2 is gained. The decomposion result of NTD is 
depicted in Fig.8, in which we can clearly see the component 
1,2 and component 3,4 represent class 1 and class 2 respec-
tively. From the time-frequency spectrum component we 
verify the conclusion about frequency band in the method 
mentioned above.  
The training tensor Ytr and testing tensor Yts are then 
operated. There are three classifiers including KNN, LDA 
and SVM. And for SVM, the ‘RBF’ kernel is trained. The 
average accuracy is used to evaluate the classification 
performance. The accuracies of three movement conditions 
using EEG signals, sEMG signals, or both EEG and sEMG 
signals are shown in Tab.1 corresponding to KNN, LDA and 
SVM respectively.

IV. DISCUSSION 
Exploring the synchronous usage of EEG and sEMG, and 
fusing all channels’ feature are very important for achieving a 
good robot control. Generally, EEG and sEMG signal are 
stored in the form of one dimensional. However, the infor-
mation only in time domain is not enough to extract 
discriminative features from different conditions. Much 
useful latent information is hidden in other domains including 
trails, conditions, subjects, space, time, and frequency. To 
propose a synchronous and multi-domain feature extraction 
and multidimensional data mining method is increasingly 
important.  
Various EEG and sEMG signal processing algorithms, 
such as wavelet transforms [15], wavelet packet transforms 
[16] and EMD [17], have been proposed to discover features 
in two domains- time and frequency. Nonetheless, there will 
be more available factors if multi-domain information is 
taken into consideration. What’s more, in order to analysis 
EEG and sEMG parallelly, a fusion method is needed at the 
same time. Many data fusion approaches are using simple 
method to synthesize information such as weight fusion, 
however, how to determine the weight of EEG and sEMG 
feature is a hard problem to solve. In addition, in previous 
works, EEG and sEMG features are extracted separately first 
and then fused by forming feature vector in feature level as 
the input of classifier which may underutilize the information 
in data level [10]. 
One of the most promising method of multidimensional 
data analysis is the tensor-based method which can extract 
latent components with different dimension in each mode and 
investigate complex interactions among them. Multi-domain 
information can be transformed and organized into a tensor 
(multiway arrays). NTF is an effective approach to extract 
features of high-dimensional data which is a multiway 
extension of NMF. In many practical engineering problems, 
the involved data are often negative. The components 
decomposed by NTF have the character of nonnegative, 
which ensures the physical significance of features. PCA, 
ICA are viewed as generalizations of component analysis and 
dimensionality reduction methods, however, these conven-
tional approaches don’t have nonnegative restriction, which 
makes it difficult to explain the results after factorization. For 
example, the time, frequencies, and channels are hard to 
account for if they are negative. Another advantage is sparse 
which makes the separation of local feature simple; therefore, 
it is beneficial for classification. Recently, the NTF has been 
used in the study of bio-informatics, image understanding and 
neuroscience. NTF has been used in EEG analysis about 
cognitive analysis and motor imagery [18, 19], whereas, NTF 
in synchronous and multi-domain feature extraction of EEG 
and sEMG in neural control is less intensively studied. 
In this study, we have presented a method of synchronous 
multi-domain feature extraction of EEG and sEMG signal on 
the basis of NTF. In our experiments using NTF, we chose 
the promising NTD model. High-order data across time, 
frequency, space (EEG or sEMG channels) domains and are 
decomposed into multiple components with distinct moda-
lities through this method. Components are factorized to 
identify common across different domains, and the project-
tions are calculated as the feature to discriminate different 
conditions in a lower dimension space. Because of the 
capacity of tensor to retain the information of time-
frequency-space domain and the relation of multi-domain, the 
tensor algorithm is more effective to extract implicit and 
multi-domain characteristics in the EEG and sEMG data. At 
the same time, NTF can discriminate different conditions 
4944
without prior knowledge of the frequency bands and temporal 
windows for a specific subject. What’s more, like other 
scholars say, NTF has the advantage of overcoming the low 
SNR weakness of EEG and sEMG signals for the reason that 
a component can simply be removed if it is not correlated 
with the specific task. From Tab.1 we can see that no matter 
what classifier is used, the recognition rates of using both 
EEG and sEMG signals are higher than using either EEG 
signals or sEMG signals and the average classification 
accuracy of the EEG-sEMG feature extracted by NTD is 
90.55%, which implied that the synchronous multi-domain 
feature extraction method of NTF is applicative to EEG-
sEMG analysis and the EEG-sEMG approach is more stable 
performance compared to the single conditions. Research 
shows that integrated feature extraction of EEG and sEMG 
and the quantitative description of the multi-domain charac-
teristics of EEG and sEMG are helpful to increase the 
recognition rate of the movement conditions classification. 
Especially for the patients with movement disorders, whose 
residual muscle force is so weak that it’s difficult to identify 
the movement intentions of affected limbs effectively. 
What’s more, the NTF method can be seen as combining the 
different biological electrical signals in data fusion level, 
which may also take full advantage of each source and 
improve the efficiency of classification and control. 
V. CONCLUSION 
In conclusion, NTF is a meaningful and valuable approach 
for EEG-sEMG feature extraction which is one of the most 
important parts in this EEG-sEMG-based power-assist reha-
bilitation robot system. This comprehensive method with 
synchronous and multi-domain analysis of EEG and sEMG 
signals is significative for the developing of power-assist 
rehabilitation robot. In future works, a control strategy of the 
upper limb power-assist rehabilitation robot will be proposed, 
and the feature extracted by the NTF will be used to control 
the movement trail of the robot mechanism. In addition, an 
experiment about the stroke patients will be performed. The 
internal relation of EEG and sEMG will be considered, and  
the complementary fusion feature of EEG and sEMG 
associated with the mechanism of motion will be considered 
to apply in power-assist rehabilitation robot.
