AbstractÑ This paper addresses a dynamic model and a
control method of a space robot with a rigid manipulator and
a ßexible appendage. The control method has been developed
for performing multiple tasks: end-point motion control and
vibration suppression control of a ßexible appendage. A simple
dynamic model that considers coupling between the manipu-
lator and the ßexible appendage is proposed for the control
method. The tasks are performed simultaneously on the basis
of their order of priorities using a redundant manipulator.
Additionally, because vibration suppression requires feedback
of the state of the ßexible appendage, a state estimator of the
appendage using a force/torque sensor is developed. Finally,
the proposed model, control method, and state estimator were
veriÞed experimentally using an air-ßoating system.
I. INTRODUCTION
Demand of on-orbit service robot has increased in recent
decades [1]. Space robots for space debris removal or space
structure construction are equipped with manipulators and
ßexible appendages such as solar panels and antennas, as
shown in Fig. 1. Manipulators are used for executing required
tasks; however manipulator motion and contact with the
space debris or space structures induce vibrations in the
ßexible appendage due to dynamic coupling effects of the
system. These vibrations decrease the operation accuracy and
increase the risk of mission failure. An appropriate control
method considering such effects is required for performing
a required task securely.
Control theory for a free-ßying robot with a rigid manipu-
lator was discussed on the basis of an articulated body system
in several literatures [2][3]. However, research on the control
of a space robot that considers the coupling between rigid
manipulators and ßexible appendages is limited. Zarafshan
and Moosavian studied the dynamics and control of such
a system in [4]. However, their study ignored dynamic
coupling, which can cause closed-loop instability [5].
Nenchev et al. proposed a reactionless control method in
[6], which realizes manipulator motion without exciting base
motion by using the null-space of a redundant manipulator.

However, this method is inadequate for tasks requiring
arbitrary manipulator motion over large areas because manip-
ulator motion is severely restricted by null-space limitations.
The modeling of ßexible appendages is a key issue in vi-
bration suppression control. For analyzing ßexible appendage
behavior, the assumed mode method and the Þnite element
method are commonly used [7][8]. In general, however,
the assumed mode method requires several sensors such as
piezoelectric elements on the appendage or a visual moni-
toring system for measuring ßexible appendage state, which
increase system and operational complexity. In addition, the
Þnite element method is impractical for online feedback
control because its calculation cost is enormously high. In
our research, therefore, we employ the virtual joint model
proposed by Yoshikawa [9], which approximates ßexible
manipulators as virtual rigid links and passive spring joints.
This model expresses a complex ßexible appendage as a
simple articulated body with dominant dynamic character-
istics. Using this method, a free-ßying robot with ßexible
appendages can be modeled as a reduced articulated body
system. This reduced model makes it possible to calculate
robot dynamics in real time using limited computational
resources.
In a previous research, we developed a simple dynamic
model of a space robot with a rigid manipulator and a ßexible
appendage using the virtual joint model for suppressing
vibrations of the ßexible appendage [10]. In addition, we
designed a state estimator for the ßexible appendage to
achieve control using a force/torque sensor attached between
the robot base and the appendage. However, the control
method in [10] did not consider end-point motion, while
vibration suppression was implemented successfully. In this
paper, the simultaneous control method, which implements
the end-point motion control and the vibration suppression

control of the ßexible appendage, is derived on the basis of
a proposed simple model. In addition, an experiment using
an air-ßoating system is conducted for verifying the perfor-
mance of the proposed dynamic model, control method, and
state estimator.
II. DYNAMIC MODEL
This section brießy reviews dynamic models for a ßexible
appendage and a robot which were derived in our previous
research [10].
A. Dynamic Model of Flexible Appendage
A cantilever with a tip mass was considered as a ßexible
appendage, as shown in Fig. 2 (a). We approximated the
cantilever as a virtual joint model with one rigid link and
one passive joint, as shown in Fig. 2 (b). Reaction torque
?
f
is applied to the rigid link around the virtual joint. We
assumed that the reaction torque is linear with respect to
the virtual joint angle, and identiÞed the joint stiffness K
f
by comparing the eigenfrequencies of the above mentioned
models.
The cantilever was assumed to be a Euler-Bernoulli beam.
From the Rayleigh law, the Þrst eigenfrequency is given as
follows:

B. Dynamic Model of Free-Flying Robot
A simple dynamic model is introduced here with a manip-
ulator and ßexible appendage, which is approximated with
the virtual joint model. As an example, Fig. 3 shows a
dynamic model with a three-joint manipulator and a one-
joint ßexible appendage. We assumed that the robot is in a
micro-gravity environment; therefore, gravity does not apply.
Given that no external force and moment are exerted on the
end-point and base, the equation of motion of this free-ßying
system is as follows [2]:

where the superscript Ò+Ó denotes the pseudo inverse, I
denotes the identity matrix, and? denotes an arbitrary vector.
The second term in the right-hand side of (12) is called null
space and can be utilized for an additional task using the
manipulator redundancy.
B. Vibration Suppression Control
The basic law of vibration suppression was introduced in
[11]. Using (5), the lower part of (6) can be expressed with
the components of
ö
H and ö c as follows:

spectively, and ö c

tion as follows:

where t and Æt denote the experimental time and the control

C. Simultaneous Control
Simultaneous control methods using redundant manipula-
tors can be classiÞed in two approaches: task-space augmen-
tation and task-priority resolution. The task-space augmenta-
tion approach uses a square matrix built from the constraints
on a primary task and an additional task. Such a square
matrix is called the extended Jacobian or the augmented
Jacobian and is used for resolving a proper manipulator joint
motion via its inverse matrix. However, this approach does
not consider the priority order of these tasks, and therefore,
the solution becomes unfeasible for both tasks around an
algorithmic singularity, which is a conÞguration where the
tasks are in conßict with each other. In contrast, the task-
priority resolution approach provides a proper solution based
on the priority order of the given tasks [12]. Under this
approach, the lower-priority task is executed using a null
space of the higher-priority task. In addition, using the lower-
priority relaxation based on the task-priority resolution in
[13], this approach can implement the higher-priority task
even around an algorithmic singularity by reducing the null
space component for the lower-priority task. In this paper,
we derived a control law according to this approach.
In general, end-point motion control is considered as the
primary task over vibration suppression control of the ßexible
appendage because end-point motion errors cause result in
severe failure such as an undesired collision with a free-
ßying object. According this order of priority, the desired
manipulator angular velocity for simultaneous control is
given from (12) and (17) as follows:
ú
?

(18)
where ú x
d
e
denotes the desired end-pint velocity. This control
law preferentially implements end-point control and per-
forms vibration suppression for ßexible appendage using the
null space of end-point control. Note that this control law
requires feedback of the angle and the angular velocity on
the ßexible appendageÕs virtual joint. The state estimator of
the ßexible appendage for this feedback control is presented
in the next section.

D. Design of Flexible Appendage State Estimator
In case that the ßexible appendage is modeled as a single
virtual joint, the angular velocity of this virtual joint can be
estimated using the force/torque sensor attached between the
base and the ßexible appendage.
Assuming that the damping term is negligibly small, the
virtual joint angle can be expressed as follows using (5):
?
f
=
?
f
K
f
(19)
where ?
f
denotes the torque measured by the force/torque
sensor. The angular velocity
ú
?
f
, which is used for feedback
control, can be obtained numerically from the differential
value of ?
f
provided by (19).
IV. EXPERIMENT
An experimental study was conducted for validating the
proposed control scheme based on the simpliÞed model and
estimated feedback value.
A. Assumptions
The feedback values are obtained from the state estimator
described in the above section. The control law given by
(18) requires the calculation of J
gf
,
ö
H
fm
and ö c
f
, which
are obtained from the inertia matrices H
b
and H
bc
. These
inertia matrices are functions of the virtual joint angle ?
f
.
However, the angle ?
f
is difÞcult to be measured using the
force/torque sensor because the force/torque sensor often has
offset error, while the angular velocity
ú
?
f
is not affected by
this offset because it is obtained via differentiation. In this
experiment, therefore, approximated inertia matrices that do
not depend on the virtual joint angle are used for calculating
the control input.
Suppose that the virtual joint angle of the ßexible ap-
pendage is small and the inertia matrices can be approxi-
mated as the values around the equilibrium point, i.e.,

(?

m
,?
f
)?H
bc
(?

where ?
b
denotes the base attitude vector. From the above
approximations, the inertia matrices turn into functions that
do not depend on the virtual joint angle. These approximated
inertia matrices were tested in our previous research, and the
control ability using them was experimentally conÞrmed in
[10].
B. Experimental Setup
We developed an air-ßoating system that can emulate
planar motion under a micro-gravity environment using an air
bearing, as shown in Fig. 4. This system uses pressurized air
to ßoat up a robot on a ßat plane for realizing frictionless mo-
tion between the robot and the plane. The robot is equipped
with a three-joint manipulator and a ßexible appendage. The
robot parameters are listed in Table I. The symbols in this list
are the same as those in Fig. 3. Furthermore, this robot has a
gyroscope on its base, which measures its angle and angular
velocity of rotation. The manipulator encoders provide each

joint angles and angular velocities. The ßexible appendage is
a cantilever with a tip mass and is attached to the robot base
through a force/torque sensor that measures the appendageÕs
angular velocity (see Fig. 4). The values measured using
the gyroscope, manipulator encoders, and force/torque sensor
are used for feedback control. The dynamic calculation and
input-output data transfer for the control are performed by
an on-board computer.
The motions of the robot and the ßexible appendage were
measured using external motion capture cameras that track
markers on the robot and the ßexible appendage, as shown
in Fig. 5.
C. Experimental Conditions
Using the developed robot with the ßexible appendage, we
conducted two different experiments: (i) end-point control
based on a fully-rigid model and (ii) simultaneous control
based on the proposed dynamic model. In (i), appendage
ßexibility is ignored, and the appendage is considered as
a rigid body attached to the base. In contrast, in (ii), a
ßexible appendage is modeled using the virtual joint model,
and the control scheme simultaneously implements end-point
control and vibration suppression control for the appendage.
In both cases, only the end-point position (x
e
and y
e
) is
considered for end-point control, and its orientation is not
controlled. In (ii), the end-point control is implemented using
two degrees of freedom of the three-joint manipulator, and
the vibration suppression control is performed using one
degree of freedom.
In both the experiments, the initial state was stable and the

distance between the initial and Þnal end-point positions,
i.e., the length of the desired path is 0.2 m. During the Þrst
3 s, the end-point approaches the goal point, and appendage
vibrations are induced. After 3 s, the end-point remains at
the goal point with and without suppressing the appendage
vibrations.

are shown by solid lines.
Fig. 9 (a) shows the result of manipulator joint angles. In
(i), manipulator motion was stopped at t = 3 [s] because
the desired end-point velocity decreased to 0 m/s after
this moment. In contrast, in (ii), the manipulator continued
moving even after t = 3 [s] for suppressing vibrations

of the ßexible appendage, while the end-point maintained
itÕs position. Such manipulator motions are conÞrmed in
Fig. 8 as well. In Fig. 9 (b), the tip deßections of the ßex-
ible appendage are compared. The vibration of the ßexible
appendage was suppressed via the proposed simultaneous
control. However, small-amplitude vibrations were not sup-
pressed, while the dominant large-amplitude vibrations were
successfully suppressed. This is ascribed to limitations of the
manipulator actuator and the sensor. Motion with a small
angular velocity is difÞcult to realize because of hardware
limitations. In addition, the small deßections can not be
measured precisely owing to electrical noise. Although the
noise can be practically reduced using a low-pass Þlter, noise
Þltering causes time delay in the control system. Thus, in the
experiments, we experimentally regulated the Þltering level
based on trade-off between the measurement accuracy and
the controlled response. Fig. 9 (c) shows the responses of
the end-point velocities. In this Þgure, the desired end-point
velocities on the x and y axes are indicated by a green line
and a black line, respectively. The errors between the actual
velocity and the desired velocity in the experiment (i) during
the Þrst 3 s were larger than those in the experiment (ii).
In addition, even after the end-point motion input became
0 m/s at t = 3 [s], oscillatory errors were observed in (i).
These errors are attributed to a loss of a consideration for
the appendage ßexibility in the control model. In contrast,
in (ii) which considers the appendage ßexibility, the end-
point velocity was sufÞciently close to the desired velocity
even in periods where the ßexible appendageÕs vibrations
were not suppressed. This result indicated that end-point
control based on the proposed model can reduce its error.
Fig. 9 (d) shows the time history of the angular velocities of
the ßexible appendageÕs virtual joint. The estimated angular
velocity of the virtual joint in (ii) is indicated by a red line
in this Þgure. Although the estimated value oscillates owing
6635
to force/sensor noise, it was able to estimate the angular
velocity, and therefore, the vibration suppression control
was realized successfully. Fig. 9 (e) shows the end-point
position responses. The desired paths, which are calculated
from the desired velocity in (22) and the initial position,
are indicated by a green line and a black line. In addition,
an enlarged Þgure showing the end-point position on the
x axis is inserted. In this Þgure, the end-point position in
(i) had larger errors in comparison with that in (ii), and
it oscillated. These errors in (i) are ascribed to a loss of
a consideration for the appendage ßexibility. Figs. 9 (b)
and (e) show that the simultaneous control implemented the
end-point control with suppressing appendageÕs vibrations.
Although vibrations were induced in the appendage because
the vibration suppressionÕs priority was assigned secondly,
the vibration suppression was performed without disturbing
the end-point control. This result indicated that the proposed
simultaneous control was successfully implemented accord-
ing to the assigned order of tasksÕ priorities. Fig. 9 (f) shows
the result of the base attitude. Although drifting of the base
owing to low gradient of the air bearing and the ground
plane was observed, as a result of the vibration suppression,
the base attitude vibrations were also suppressed in the
experiment (ii). In contrast, in the experiment (i), the base
attitude continued to vibrate because the base was affected
by the ßexible appendageÕs vibrations.
The above experimental results proved that the proposed
simple model and control method using state estimation
for a ßexible appendage can adequately and simultaneously
control end-point motion and suppress vibrations of a ßexible
appendage of a free-ßying robot.
V. CONCLUSIONS
This paper presented a simultaneous control method for
end-point motion and vibration suppression of a ßexible ap-
pendage of a space robot. We proposed a simpliÞed dynamic
model using a virtual joint model and the state estimator
of a ßexible appendage using a force/torque sensor. The
simultaneous control method using a redundant manipulator
was derived on the basis of the proposed model. Practical
viability of the control method based on the proposed model
and state estimation was veriÞed experimentally using an
air-ßoating system. The experimental results showed that
the proposed control scheme is sufÞciently able to increase
accuracy of end-point motion and suppress vibrations of a
ßexible appendage.
As future works, a robust observer system and an adaptive
control method to guarantee the stability with respect to
model errors and sensor noises will be developed. In addi-
tion, a three-dimensional veriÞcation of the proposed method
will be implemented using a hybrid simulator and a real scale
robot.
