excitation

Abstract—In this paper we design a robot that can move
forward and backward based on the vibration excitation. The
proposed design enables the robot to locomote on the horizontal
surface using the vibration excitation that is perpendicular
to the locomotion direction. The bidirectional locomotion is
achieved, and the direction of motion is determined by the
vibration frequency. This new type of robot is useful for the un-
conventional environment where complex moving mechanisms
cannot be applied to the robots such as medical, small pipe-
line, and underwater vehicle applications. To this end, two
springs with different stiffness are perpendicularly connected
and support the main body of the robot. The dynamic response
of this nonlinear system to the vibration enables the robot
to walk forward and backward depending on the vibration
frequency. The numerical simulation of this system and the
experiments with actual hardware design verify the proposed
approach.
I. INTRODUCTION
Nowadays it is not surprising to see robotic technolo-
gies that are applied to biology, medicine, pipe-line, and
underwater environment. One of the most famous example is
the robotic surgical systems [1], [2]. Usually these surgical
systems consist of actuators, sensors, control system, and
surgical tools. The size and complexity of the overall system
are not strictly limited, but the size of the surgical tools in
such systems is usually minimized for minimally invasive
surgery.
The emergence of small size robots ranging from cen-
timeters (cm) to micrometers (?m) opened the door to new
types of surgery, diagnosis, and treatment. For example, let us
consider endoscopy. The endoscopy is a diagnostic procedure
where a doctor inserts a tethered ﬂexible endoscope into
human body to examine the interior of a hollow organ or
cavity of the body. To overcome the disadvantage of the
tethered endoscope (limited reachability, patient discomfort,
etc.), a wireless endoscope system, or capsule endoscope,
has been developed [3], [4]. In the capsule-shaped system,
an optical sensor, LED light sources, image transmitter, and
battery are packaged. A patient swallows the small capsule,
and the system captures and transmits many images of the
gastrointestinal tract for several hours. A drawback of the
capsule endoscope is that it passes through the gastrointesti-
nal tract passively by the natural peristaltic contractions of
the bowel. In this way, it may miss lesions on organs. To

overcome this, a couple of external actuation methods for
the capsule endoscopy have been developed [5], [6], [7], and
the clinical tests started very recently [8], [9]. The internal
locomotion mechanisms are proposed [10], [11], [12], [13],
[14], [15], [16], [17], [18], but they increase the robot size
and also require an internal power source. The maneuver-
ing methods for capsule endoscopes using magnetic ﬁeld
gradient or rotating magnetic ﬁeld were introduced [5], [6],
[7], but the study about the use of alternating (or vibrating)
magnetic ﬁeld is relatively rare. This paper explores the use
of vibration excitation for locomotion of small robots with
the hope that this technology will lead to the advancement
in medical robots.
Traditionally there have been considerable efforts to re-
duce or avoid mechanical vibration that causes the adverse
effects on the system such as part wear, loose assembly,
instability, and noisy sound. However, the vibration can also
cause locomotion of small robotic systems. For example, it
is easily observed that when a cell phone is vibrating in the
silent mode, it slides on the hard surface of a table. The
vibrating mechanism of a cell phone consists of a miniature
motor (about 20 mm length and 5 mm diameter) and an
rotating unbalanced weight. It is surprising to realize that
such a small motor can make a cell phone (over 200 g) slide
without a complex mechanism such as a gearbox or wheels.
In addition, the vibration of a kids’ toy (Hexbug [19]) shown
in Fig. 1(a) causes random style translational motion. The
propulsion is generated from the physical contact between
the vibrating toy legs and the ground. ViRob [20] shown
in Fig. 1(b) was developed in the lab of Prof. Shoham in
the Medical Robotics Laboratory at the Israel Institute of
Technology in 2009, showing the possibility of the new
types of medical treatment for lung cancer and cardiovascular
disease. The vibrating magnetic ﬁeld induces the small
robot’s vibration, and the robot can advance in the narrow
channel due to the periodic physical interaction between
the robot and the environment. Thus the vibration shows

two different faces, how to avoid or how to utilize. This
paper is interested in how to utilize the vibration for robot
locomotion.
This paper concerns the design of a robot that can move
forward and backward (bidirectional locomotion) using the
vibration excitation. Speciﬁcally the excitation is applied
perpendicular to the locomotion direction. More importantly,
the motion direction will be determined by the vibration
frequency.
The main approach in this paper was inspired by vibra-
tion absorbers which is one of the traditional subjects in
the vibration study. As shown in Fig. 2, the machine is
operating with the internal motor or engine. This can be
seen in many traditional mechanical systems such as press
machines, lathes, drilling machines, and milling machines.
The rotational motion of the internal actuator will also excite
the system, and the vibration may induce the unwanted
resonance. A vibration absorber is introduced to avoid or
reduce this resonant effect. The mathematical analysis shows
that we can determine the optimal parameters for the mass
and the spring stiffness of the absorber so that the unwanted
vibration is minimized and the vibration of the absorber is
also bounded at the same time [21]. More direct use of the
multi-DOF system inspired by the vibration absorber to the
vibration-induced locomotion was introduced in [22]. In this
work, the small-sized multi-DOF system is actuated by the
vibrating plate, and the system motion can be manipulated by
the various vibration input. Vartholomeos et al. [23] studied
more fundamental phenomena on vibration and locomotion,
and validate it by experiments. In this context, the structure
design for the system becomes very important because the
successful locomotion depends on the interior and exterior
structure of the system.
This paper proposes a robot design which uses the vi-
bration excitation to induce the bidirectional locomotion.
This paper is organized as follows. Section II presents our
preliminary tests as motivation. Section III shows our design
scheme, derivation of dynamics equations and numerical
analysis. In Section IV, a robot is actually built to verify
the design idea and the experimental results are presented.
The conclusion is given in Section V.
II. PRELIMINARY TESTS
Several preliminary tests were performed as motivation for
this research. Fig. 3(a) shows a caterpillar-shape small robot
which is actuated by the vibrating magnetic ﬁeld. It is made

of a drinking straw with the ferromagnetic metal inside, and
has multiple passive legs. This small robot is placed in the
plastic tube and the vibrating magnetic ﬁeld is applied.
Note that the magnetic ﬁeld is vibrating (or alternating),
not rotating. The vibrating magnetic ﬁeld is relatively easier
to obtain than the rotating one by applying alternate inputs
into two parallel electromagnets as shown in Fig. 3(a). To
verify the effect of the legs on the caterpillar’s locomotion,
the caterpillar without legs was also tested. The role of
the legs for the caterpillar robot was veriﬁed as shown in
Fig. 3(b). The caterpillar with legs went forward, while
the caterpillar without legs did not effectively walk. This
locomotion was possible because of the physical interaction
of the legs and the environment. The question on how to
make the robot go backward still remains.

Bidirectional locomotion.
Fig. 4 shows the test with a ﬁst-size robot for bidirectional
locomotion induced by different vibration frequencies. This
prototype was inspired by the fact that the dynamic response
of the vibration absorber is different depending on the
vibration frequency. This opens a way to control a vibrating
robot by changing the vibration frequency. Fig. 4(a) shows
the design scheme of the two-leg walking robot. In the main
machine, the motor with the unbalanced weight generates
the vibration. By employing a hard spring on the left and a
soft one on the other, we can obtain the different vibration
5045
responses from the two legs. Due to the special design of the
bottom surface of the foot, the physical collision between the
foot and the ground induces the translational motion of the
system. In Figs. 4(b) and (c), the numerical simulation shows
that the legs are intrinsically ﬂuctuated depending on the
vibration frequency. Consequently by changing the vibration
frequency, we can obtain the locomotion in the opposite di-
rection. Based on the design scheme, we made the hardware
as shown in Fig. 4(d) and the robot moved bidirectionally
depending on the vibration frequency as shown in Fig. 4(e)
in which the triangles denote the positions of the robot center
captured in video at every time step ?t=0.33s.
III. DESIGN, MATHEMATICAL MODEL, AND NUMERICAL
ANALYSIS
The design for the robot in this paper is directly inspired
by the work in [23]. The main difference is that the horizontal
force by the unbalanced weight is ignored and only vertical
excitation is considered. We apply multiple springs so as
to induce the bidirectional locomotion using vibration with
multiple input frequencies. A large block (mass M)is
connected to a foot (mass m) through two spring-damper
sets as shown in Fig. 5(a). Some assumptions employed for
the mathematical model are as follow.
• This model is in 2D space.
• Upper block (M) does not rotate.
• Foot (m) is always in contact with the ground.
• We ignore the horizontal vibration force.
• Coulomb friction model is used for horizontal friction
force between the foot and the ground.
• The spring and damper are linear and massless.
• The hinge is frictionless.

For a simple model, we prevent the rotational motion of
the large block. This assumption becomes obvious if two sets
of a foot and two springs are horizontally attached under the
large block. The actual implementation of the hardware will
use four foot sets, each of which consists of a foot and two
springs to ensure the balance as will be shown in Section IV,
but its theoretical analysis can be done with the reduced
system shown in Fig. 5(a).

This will be implemented in the hardware design by rotating
the weight on the x?z plane (see Fig. 5(a)). The main reason
we focus on this type of vibration is because in this paper we
are testing the idea that the vibration excitation perpendicular
to the locomotion direction can induce the locomotion. We
performed the numerical simulation for the design using the
equations of motion in (1)-(3). The system parameters are
given in Table I. The vibration frequencies 4Hz and 7Hz were
tested. Although we chose these two vibration frequencies

by trial-and-error, the starting point for the frequency search
was obtained as follows. The locomotion will be driven by
the resonance effect in each spring. The natural frequency
of the vertical motion of the large block can be estimated
by f =

Using this starting point, we chose the two frequencies 4Hz
and 7Hz for the simulation tests.
Fig. 6 shows the results from numerical simulation with
the vibration frequency 4Hz. The robot is moving to the
right (+y direction). It is worth seeing the horizontal net
force (¨ y
2
) computed in (1) shown in Fig. 7. Even though the
vibration excitation is applied in the vertical direction, the
asymmetric horizontal force is generated on the foot due to
the asymmetry of the two springs and the surface friction.
Fig. 8 shows the lengths of the two springs in the test with
the frequency 4Hz. The right spring (softer than the left one)
has higher ﬂuctuation than the left one. We can expect that
this will change with the different vibration frequency, which
may lead to the locomotion to the opposite direction. The last
thing to check is the normal force f

on the foot. Since we

assumed that the contact between the foot and the ground
is preserved, we should check if the normal force is always
positive. Fig. 9 conﬁrms that the normal force is positive
when the vibration frequency is 4Hz.
With the vibration frequency 7Hz, the robot moves to the
left (-y direction) as shown in Fig. 10. Fig. 11 shows the
horizontal net force (¨ y

frequency 7Hz, the left spring (stiffer than the right one)
ﬂuctuates more than the right one as shown in Fig. 12. Fig. 13
conﬁrms that the normal force is always positive when the
vibration frequency is 7Hz.
Through the numerical analysis, we conﬁrmed the pos-
sibility that the proposed design can move forward and
backward directions, and the direction is determined by the
speciﬁc vibration frequencies.

A. Hardware
The small robot we designed is shown in Fig. 14. To en-
sure the balance of the whole system on the horizon ground,
we built the small robot by combining four simpliﬁed unit
as proposed in Fig. 5(a). Each unit consists of a foot, a stiff
spring and a soft spring. We used shock absorbers that are
generally used in RC cars. A round metal plate is assembled
at end of each leg as a foot. A motor to generate vibration
frequency was attached to the center of the robot body and
its frequency was controlled wirelessly. The experimental
parameters for each unit are given in Table II. Note that
we do not have to specify the damping constants, because
the dampers are used to guarantee the stability and they do
not affect the special frequencies that induce the bidirectional
locomotion. As explained in Section III, the rotation plane
of the unbalanced weight is perpendicular to the locomotion
direction. To prevent the motion along z-axis (see Fig. 5(a))
the guide rails are used as shown in Fig. 15. Ball casters
attached on both sides of the robot ensure the smooth slide
of the robot on the guide rails. The total robot size is 90
mm(L)? 160 mm(W) ?95 mm(H) and the total weight is
0.502 kg.
B. Experiments
Experiments were performed by putting the robot between
two parallel guide rails which help the robot to move in
two directions (forward or backward) and one web camera
is mounted above the robot perpendicularly to capture the
motion of the robot. According to theory, the robot was
expected to move to the side of stiff springs with relatively
high vibration frequency and will move to the opposite
direction with relatively low frequency.
As explained in Section III, we computed the starting
point for the frequency search. The combined spring constant
for the robot along the vertical direction was measured
as k
c
= 3458.8 N/m. This measured spring constant is
slightly larger than the combined spring constant calculated
by parameters in Table II. Since the body mass is M = 0.071
kg, the natural frequency is
√
k
c
/(2π
√
M)=35.1Hz. From
5048
this value, we tested with various frequencies. After trial and
error, we chose the frequencies 43Hz and 32.5Hz for the test.
Fig. 15 shows the experimental results captured by the
web camera. The triangles denote the positions of the robot
center captured in video at every time step ?t =0.67s.
As shown in Fig. 15(a), the robot moves upward (to stiff
springs) when the vibration frequency is 43Hz. With the
frequency 32.5Hz, the downward locomotion (to soft springs)
was observed as shown in Fig. 15(b). Fig. 16 shows the
plot of the robot position as a function of time. This test
was performed continuously. In other words, the vibration
frequency was changed from 43Hz to 32.5Hz at t=18(sec).
With this frequency change, the locomotion direction was
promptly changed.
For the actual experiments, we used different design
parameters from the numerical analysis in Section III because
the parameters in the numerical analysis are not realizable.
For example, the actual small robot generally excited by the
vibration frequency at least 30Hz. Above all, the purpose of
the numerical analysis is not to ﬁnd a speciﬁc frequency for
the bidirectional motion but to conﬁrm the possibility for the
bidirectional motion.
V. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we proposed a design for a robot that could
move forward and backward using the vibration excitation
of two different frequencies. Asymmetric spring supports
were used in the robot design. To verify the design idea, we
performed a numerical simulation, and then implemented our
design by making a test robot.
Due to the asymmetry of springs and the surface friction
between the robot and the ground, the asymmetric horizontal
force was produced from the vertical vibration. This force
generated the locomotion of the robot. Using the vibration
frequency, we could control the direction of the robot loco-
motion. We veriﬁed the manipulation of robot locomotion
by changing vibration frequency in the numerical simulation
and the actual experiments.
The proposed design idea opens a door to new design
scheme for medical devices such as a capsule endoscope
and micro medical robots. Since the size of the medical
robots is strictly limited, the internal actuation is hard to
apply. However, it is relatively easy to excite the small robot
using vibrating magnetic ﬁeld. If we adapt the design method
proposed in this paper to the design of medical robots, it
becomes possible to manipulate them using remote magnetic
ﬁeld. The surface design and fabrication for this system in
micro or nano scale will be a challenging research topic for
the future.
