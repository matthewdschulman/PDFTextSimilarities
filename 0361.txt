Abstract—The omnidirectional mobile robots with MY
wheels-II are discontinuous dynamic systems. This paper de-
rives a continuous model from a given discontinuous dynamic
model. Firstly, the problem of a previously proposed dynamic
model, average dynamic model, is analyzed. It shows that
the e?ectiveness of the average dynamic model is limited to
robots under a certain class of conﬁgurations. To overcome
this problem, we ﬁrst derive the switching conditions of MY
wheel-II. Then a continuous dynamic modeling method, using
adaptive continuous curves instead of the real discontinuous
contact radius in the discontinuous dynamic model, is proposed
basedontheswitchingconditions.Theresultingdynamicmodel
is a smooth NLPV model, which may then be used as one
solution for the model-based control design. The e?ectiveness
of the proposed NLPV model is veriﬁed and compared through
open-loop simulations against the average model.
I. INTRODUCTION
Recently, omnidirectional mobile robots (OMRs) are be-
coming increasingly popular in many applications, especially
inthenarrowspaces,sincetheycanperformtranslationaland
rotational motion independently and simultaneously.
Variousomnidirectionalwheelmechanismswereproposed
in the past few decades. In our previous work [1], we
classiﬁed these wheel mechanisms into two groups, namely,
“non-switch wheels” and “switch wheels”. The classiﬁcation
depends on whether the contact radius of the robot switches
during the robot motion. The contact radius is the distance
between mass center of the robot and the wheel contact point
with ground. Many omnidirectional wheels are “non-switch
wheels”, such as Mecanum wheel [2], Alternate wheel [3]
and Ball wheel [4], [5]. For non-switch wheeled OMRs, the
contact radius of the wheel to the center of gravity of the
robot is constant. On the other hand, by far, the proposed
“switch wheels” are shown in Fig. 1. They are Longitudinal
orthogonal-wheel [6], MY wheel [7], MY wheel-II [8],
Swedish wheel [9] and Omni-wheel [10]. Switch wheeled
OMRs have the advantages such as, smooth contact with
the ground [6] and higher payload ability [7]. Specially, the
MY wheel-II mechanism is more insensitive to the fragments
on the ground. However, these ﬁve mechanisms have a
common feature, i.e., the contact radius of the wheel to the
center of gravity of the robot switches. The dynamics of
the non-switch wheeled OMRs is smooth nonlinear while
the switch wheeled OMRs are switched nonlinear systems

(hybrid systems), i.e., the robot dynamics is discontinuous
due to the switching e?ects [1].
The tracking controller design based on the discontinuous
dynamic model is still an open problem, since the switch
wheeled OMRs are autonomous switched nonlinear dynamic
systems [11], [12]. On the other hand, most of the analysis
and control design methods in the literature are based on
the continuous dynamic models. Thereby, the continuous
dynamic modeling for the switch wheeled OMRs is indeed
expected. In fact, this idea is widely employed in the
control of hybrid systems [13], while the modeling errors
are considered as the perturbation of the closed-loop system.
In [1], we proposed an average dynamic modeling method
for an OMR with MY wheels-II, which results in a smooth
nonlinear dynamic model.
In this paper, a continuous nonlinear parameter varying
(NLPV) model is derived from a given discontinuous model.
First, a brief analysis of the average model is presented. It
shows that the e?ectiveness of the average dynamic model is
limitedtorobotsunderacertainclassofconﬁgurations.Then
the switching conditions of the MY wheel-II mechanism
are analyzed. Based on the derived switching conditions, a
NLPV model is derived to overcome the limitations of the
average dynamic modeling method. Its key idea is to design
adaptive continuous curves to approach the real discontin-
uous contact radius. The obtained adaptive curves are then
used instead of the real contact radius in the discontinuous
dynamic model. Finally, open loop simulations show that
the NLPV model is much more accurate in predicting the
responses of the discontinuous model, than the average
model.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In
Section II, the discontinuous dynamic model is derived.
The problem of the average dynamic modeling method is
also analyzed. In Section III, the NLPV dynamic model is
presented. Simulations are presented in Section IV. Finally,
conclusions are drawn in Section V.

A. Prototype Platform
The MY wheel-II mechanism assembly and its end-view
are shown in Fig. 2. It can be seen from Fig. 2(a) that
each wheel has two contact points with the ground. The
two contact points switch between the two sets of crowns
whenever the wheel turns
π
4
, and therefore eight switches
occur during each turn (see Fig. 2(b)). Attention should
be paid to the absolute encoder installed in each assembly,
which is used to detect the switching of the contact radius
(see Fig. 2(a)). If odometry is employed in the positioning of
switchwheeledOMRs,theabsoluteencoderisindispensable.
The prototype platform is shown in Fig. 3, with three MY
wheel-II assemblies arranged with a 120
?
interval angle
underneath the steel disk. For a detailed description of the
MY wheel-II mechanism and the prototype platform, the
readers are referred to [8].

around the robot mass center, I
0
is the combined moment
of inertia of the motor, gear train and wheel referred to the
motor shaft, b

is the combined viscous friction coe?cient
of the motor, gear and wheel and n is the gear reduction

It can be seen from (3) that, the contact radius L
i
switches
between the inner and outer wheel contact radius, i.e.,
between D
in
and D
out
.Therefore,eachwheelhastwocontact
modes and each contact mode corresponds to a smooth
nonlinear dynamical subsystem. Therefore, a three-wheeled
OMR based on MY wheels-II has eight contact modes in
total. All of the contact modes are listed in Table I. When the
robot moves with rotation, the robot is a switched nonlinear
system because the robot dynamics switches between the
subsystems. In addition, the switching signal of the switched
nonlinear system is the wheel contact radius, i.e., L =
[
L

L
2
L
3
]
T
. Furthermore, the robot is an autonomous
switched nonlinear system.
C. Average Dynamic Model
Due to the fact that most of the control design methods
are based on continuous dynamic models, the continuous
dynamic modeling for the switch wheeled OMRs is desired.
In our previous work, we proposed an average dynamic
modeling method to derive the continuous dynamic model
[1]. The average dynamic model can be easily derived by
usingtheaveragecontactradius L
a
insteadoftherealcontact
radius in the discontinous dynamic mdoel (2); that is,
L
i
=L
a
=
D
out
+D
in
2
i=1,2,3.
Obviously, one main advantage of the average dynamic
model is that it is very easy to be obtained. The derived
average dynamic model is smooth and nonlinear. In addition,
the switching time is not required in this modeling method,
i.e., the absolute encoder is unnecessary.
However, this modeling method now presents a problem.
It can be seen from Fig. 5 (see the dotted green line) that the
real contact radius in the subinterval (t
0
, t
0
+t
1
) and (t
0
+t
1
,
t
0
+T) is D
in
and D
out
, respectively, whereas L
a
is used as
the contact radius in the average dynamic modeling method,
resulting in the error of ±(D
out
?D
in
)/2 in the parameter L
i
.
In addition, this problem becomes much more pronounced
especially when the following condition is not satisﬁed,
producing large modeling errors:
L
m
L
a
?1 (4)
where L
m
=
D
out
?D
in
2
. In other words, the real contact radius
L
i
can be considered as the nominal contact radius L
a
with
parameter variations. If the condition (4) is not satisﬁed,
this means that there are large parameter variations of the
nominal value L
a
, resulting in large modeling errors.
Moreover, the condition (4) is equivalent to the following:
?=
D
out
?D
in
D
in
?1 (5)
In other words, the distance between the two small wheel
sets (i.e., D
out
?D
in
) of the switch wheels should be quite
small compared with the contact radius of the wheel to the
center of gravity of the robot (i.e., D
in
or D
out
). For the
mobile robot with large ?, signiﬁcant modeling errors are
produced in the average dynamic model. Therefore, more
accurate continuous modeling method is expected, especially
for the robots with large ?.
III. NLPVMODEL
In this section, we ﬁrst derive the conditions leading to
the wheel switching. Then based on the wheel switching
conditions, a NLPV model is proposed for the robot.

case of condition (ii), when the change of the wheel rotation
direction happens during the inner wheel contact. In other
words, during the inner wheel contact with the ground, the
wheel ﬁrst moves along
?
AB in one direction. Then it changes
the rotation direction and moves along
?
BA.
B. NLPV Model
As analyzed before, the problem of average dynamic
modeling method is that it produces a parameter error of
±L
m
intheparameter L
i
.Therefore,amoreaccuratedynamic
model can be designed by reducing this parameter error. The
key idea is to ﬁnd a continuous curve to approach the real
discontinuous contact radius D
in
and D
out
in the subinterval
(t
0
, t
0
+t
1
) and (t
0
+t
1
, t
0
+T), respectively. Fig. 5 shows an
example using sinusoid to approach the real contact radius
(see the dashed red line). We can see that, compared with
using the average contact radius L
a
, the use of sinusoid to
approach the real contact radius L
i
produces much smaller
parameter error. The NLPV model is derived by directly
replacing the real discontinuous contact radius L
i
in (2) with
the continuous curve, such as sinusoid. Therefore, the NLPV
model guarantees much better performance in predicting the
behavior of the robot than the average dynamic model, even
though the ? of the switch wheeled OMR is large.
The switching of the contact radius L
i
is periodic only
under special conditions, which can be derived by detailed
analysis of the robot kinematics. The design of continuous
curve to approximate the periodic switching of the contact
radius is simple. However, in most cases, the switching of
the contact radius is non-periodic. Therefore, the designed
continuous curve should be adaptive to approach the non-
periodic switching of the contact radius. Fortunately, this
problem can be easily solved based on the derived switching
conditions, regardless of periodic or non-periodic switching
of the contact radius.
In the following, the adaptive sinusoid L
NLPV
i
is designed
to approach the discontinuous contact radius L
i
. From the
switching conditions (i) and (ii), it can be seen that the
maximum wheel turned angle that leads to the switching
of the contact radius is
π
4
, which is an essential property
of the MY wheel-II mechanism. Therefore, the ?
in
i0
and ?
out
i0
can be used as the variable of the sinusoid L
NLPV
i
. Since
the switching of the contact radius between D
in
and D
out
is
alternate, the period of the sinusoid is set as
π
2
. Then the
adaptive sinusoid L
NLPV
i
is easy to be obtained, and is given
as follows:
L
NLPV
i
=
{
L
a
?L
m
sin(4?

i0
) if L
i
=D
in
L
a
+L
m
sin(4?
out
i0
) if L
i
=D
out
(7)
where L
a
and L
m
are the same as those in (4).
The NLPV continuous dynamic model can be obtained
by directly using the continuous sinusoid L
NLPV
i
instead of
the real discontinuous contact radius L
i
in (2). The NLPV
dynamic equations are not written here due to the limited
space. In addition, the proposed NLPV model is easy to be
implemented in the practice, because it only requires the
real-time measure of the wheel rotation angle, which can
be achieved by the mounted absolute encoder. Furthermore,
L
NLPV
i
can also be viewed as time-varying parameters, re-
sulting in a nonlinear time-varying system.
In addition, the designed adaptive sinusoid L
NLPV
i
is
continuous. In the control of NLPV system, the bounded
di?erential of L
NLPV
i
, i.e.,
˙
L
NLPV
i
(t), is usually required [16].
It can be seen from (7) that the
˙
L
NLPV
i
(t) is bounded. More
importantly, all of the wheel switching cases, under either
switching conditions (i) or (ii), are included in the designed
sinusoid L
NLPV
i
.
Remark 1: In addition to the sinusoid, various contin-
uous curves, such as polynomial curves and spline, can
be employed to approach the discontinuous contact radius
based on the same idea presented above; that is, the ?
in
i0
and
?
out
i0
must be selected as variables in the curve expressions.
Moreover, the NLPV modeling error based on sinusoid can
be further reduced by using other continuous curves, such
as polynomial curves or spline (see the dash-dot blue line in
Fig. 5).
IV. SIMULATIONS
In this section, the e?ectiveness of the proposed NLPV
model in predicting the behavior of the discontinuous dy-

theproposedNLPVmodelhasbeenderivedfromthediscon-
tinuous dynamic model, it only approaches the discontinuous
dynamic model in terms of accuracy. In addition, the com-
parison with the average model is also conducted.
The following simulations were implemented in Mat-
lab/Simulink. The parameter values used in the simulations
are estimated from the robot prototype and are as follows:

Model validation is usually conducted by comparing the
responses of di?erent models under the same control input
[17]. Thereby, we give the same control input to the three
models, i.e., discontinuous model, average model and NLPV
model, respectively. In order to show the e?ectiveness of
the adaptive sinusoid L
NLPV
i
in approaching the non-periodic
switching of the contact radius, the following time-varying
control input u(t)=

u

u

Simulation results are shown in Fig. 8 - Fig. 14. It is
observed from Fig. 8 that, the designed sinusoid contact
radius is able to approach the real discontinuous contact
radius, even though the switching of the real contact radius
is non-periodic.
In addition, responses of the three models, i.e., robot
position and velocity, are depicted in Fig. 9 - Fig. 14. It
should be noted that our robot platform is with large ?, i.e.,
?=0.61. As seen in Fig. 9 - Fig. 14, the responses of the
averagedynamicmodelcertainlyhavelargeestimationerrors
againsttheresponsesproducedbythediscontinuousdynamic
model. This is because the robot conﬁguration does not meet
the requirement in (5), and thus the average dynamic mod-
eling method produces large modeling errors. However, it is
observed that the responses of the proposed NLPV model are
in excellent agreement with the responses produced by the
discontinuous dynamic model. Therefore, compared with the
average dynamic model method, the proposed NLPV model
shows deﬁnitely much better performance in approaching the
responses produced by the discontinuous model, even though
for the robot with large ?.
V. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we have derived a NLPV dynamic model
from a given discontinuous dynamic model, for a three-
wheeled OMR based on MY wheels-II. The proposed model
is simple but e?ective in approaching the responses pro-
duced by the discontinuous dynamic model, regardless of
the conﬁgurations of the robot. Firstly, we have analyzed
the problems in the average dynamic model, which showed
that the average dynamic model is only e?ective for robots
under a certain class of the conﬁgurations. Based on the

derived switching conditions of the MY wheel-II, a sim-
ple NLPV dynamic model was proposed to overcome the
problems in the average dynamic model. The key idea is
to design adaptive continuous curves to approach the real
discontinuous contact radius. Open-loop simulations veriﬁed
the e?ectiveness of the proposed NLPV modeling method
against the discontinuous dynamic model, as well as the
average model. The proposed NLPV model achieves much
better performance than the average dynamic model.
