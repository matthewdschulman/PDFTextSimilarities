Abstract—Beating-heart surgery is not currently possible for
most surgical procedures as it requires superhuman skill to
manually track the heart’s motion while performing a surgical
task. However, if a surgical tool could track the motion of
the point of interest (POI) on the heart, then, with respect to
the surgical tool tip the POI would appear stationary. Such
a system can be created with a teleoperated surgical robot
that is controlled to track the combination of the heart’s
and the surgeon’s motion, as input through a separate user
console. To develop such a system, the motion of the heart
is found in ultrasound images where the image acquisition
introduces delays of approximately 40 ms and image processing
further increases this delay. Directly using this delayed position

in this work compensates for this time delay despite large
disturbances with velocities up to 210 mm/s and accelerations

I. INTRODUCTION
Cardiovascular disease is one of the leading causes of
death worldwide [1]. Any new cardiac surgical techniques
that increase the safety and reduce the recovery time will
greatly beneﬁt society. Currently, very few procedures are
performed on a freely beating heart as the surgeon cannot
manually track the motion of the heart, which is beating with
velocities and accelerations up to 210 mm/s and 3800 mm/s
2
,
respectively [2]. Instead, the heart is either mechanically
stabilized or arrested. However, both methods have draw-
backs. Mechanically stabilizing the heart is only effective
on a localized area on the exterior surface of heart that is
accessible through the chest cavity. The pressure or suction
used to prevent motion can damage the heart tissue. Also,
there will be some residual motion [3]. Arresting the heart
after connecting the patient to a heart-lung machine can lead
to long term cognitive loss [4] and increase the risk of stroke
[5]. Complications may occur when the heart is restarted.
If the heart was made to appear stationary using a surgical
robot to move the surgical tool in synchrony with the beating
heart, these risks could be removed. Given a stabilized view
of the heart, the surgeon can now perform a surgical task on

a virtually stabilized though actually freely beating heart. In
addition, the outcome of reconstructive procedures could be
evaluated intra-operatively when improvements can be made.
The goal of this research is to develop such a system that can
be used to perform surgical procedures on both the exterior
surface and the interior of the heart through teleoperation.
II. PRIOR ART
To make the surgical tool follow the heart’s motion,
two core elements are required. The ﬁrst is a method of
determining the location of the point of interest (POI) on
the heart.
1
The second is a position control law to make the
surgical tool follow the motion of the POI found in the ﬁrst
element. As far as the ﬁrst element, the location of the POI is
found using some type of sensor data and can be divided into
two categories: non-image-based methods and image-based
methods. An important consideration is whether a time delay
is introduced when acquiring and processing the raw sensor
data to ﬁnd the position of the POI (i.e., the ﬁrst element).
This time delay, if not compensated for by the control system
(i.e., the second element), can lead to instability that may
cause the surgical tool to collide with and puncture the heart.
A diagram of a robot-assisted beating-heart surgical system
is given in Fig. 1. Different motion tracking and control
methods have been proposed in the literature and will be
discussed in more detail in the following two subsections.
A. HEART MOTION TRACKING METHODS
The heart’s motion is caused by respiratory-induced and
heartbeat-induced motion. Some motion tracking methods
can record both sources of motion, others only record the
heartbeat-induced motion. Each method is tailored to a
speciﬁc type of surgical procedure.
1
For certain procedures, the POI’s position is not tracked and thus this
ﬁrst element is not needed. This occurs when the surgical tool is force-
controlled, for example in ablation, where the surgical tool must apply a
constant force on the tissue [6], [7], [8], [9].

1) NON-IMAGE-BASED METHODS: A non-image-
based method may be used for procedures performed on
the exterior surface of the heart. For instance, the use of
sonomicrometry crystals, small crystals that are sutured to
the heart, is well suited to evaluating the surgical system
[10], [11], [12], but is not practical in the operating room.
In addition, signiﬁcant computation is required to analyze
the raw sensor data, making this method not suitable for
real-time applications. Work is being done to reduce the
computational burden with the goal of being able to use
sonomicrometry crystals in real-time [11].
2) IMAGE-BASEDMETHODS: Image-based methods, be
it from a camera or a medical imager, can capture the motion
of the surgical tool and the POI as long as both are visible in
the image. However, at times the surgical tool may occlude
the POI [3]. Camera-based methods are used to track a
POI on the exterior surface of the heart and can record
both the respiratory-induced and heartbeat-induced motion,
but they cannot be used for intracardiac procedures as they
cannot visualize through the opaque blood pool. High-speed
cameras (500Hz in [13] and 955 Hz in [14]) are proposed
for coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) procedures.
A main advantage of medical image-based methods is that
they can track a POI on the exterior surface or interior
of the heart. MRI images can track both respiratory- and
heartbeat-induced motion, but cannot be acquired in real-
time. However, ultrasound images only track the heartbeat-
induced motion as the ultrasound probe must remain in
contact with the patient’s skin and will therefore move in
synchrony with the respiratory-induced motion. On the bright
side, ultrasound images can be acquired in real-time, tens of
times per second, can visualize through blood, and are used
in [15], [16], [17] for annuloplasty and pericardial effusion.
The focus of this paper is to develop a system that
can aid in a surgical procedure performed on either the
exterior surface or the interior of the heart. For intracardiac
procedures, it is imperative to track the position of heart
tissue based on ultrasound images.
B. CONTROL METHODS
Depending on the motion tracking method chosen, differ-
ent control systems have been proposed to make the surgical
tool follow the heart’s motion. Some may need to compensate
for the data acquisition and processing time delay, others
may need to take the surgical robot’s dynamics into account
for a teleoperated system, and some may need to do both.
The control methods that compensate for time delays can be
separated into two main categories: predictive feedforward
controllers and predictive feedback controllers.
1) PREDICTIVE FEEDFORWARD CONTROL: In the
presence of data acquisition and processing delays, the heart
will have moved by the time the position measurement of
the POI is obtained. This creates the unusual requirement of
estimating the heart’s current position from past and current
sensor data. Predictive feedforward control uses an estimate
of the heart’s current position as the desired position. To
predict the current position of the POI, Bebek et al. time-
shift the motion from the previous heart beat [10] and Yuen
et al. use an extended Kalman ﬁlter based on a time-varying
Fourier series [17]. Evidently, these methods are useful for
hand-held instruments where there are no dynamics between
the surgeon and the tool (in comparison to master-slave
teleoperation, it is as if the master and the slave are combined
into one tool). They are not suitable for teleoperation where
the dynamics of the surgical robot (slave) must be accounted
for in order to accurately follow the surgeon’s motion.
2) PREDICTIVE FEEDBACK CONTROL: Predictive
feedback controllers also estimate the heart’s current position
and additionally account for the slave robot’s dynamics,
which is necessary in a teleoperation setting. Ginhoux et
al. used Generalized predictive control (GPC) to follow
the periodic respiratory-induced motion and an adaptive
disturbance predictor to follow the heartbeat-induced motion
[13]. Bowthorpe et al. used a Smith predictor to stabilize the
surgical system in the presence of long image processing
and acquisition delays of approximately 150 ms to track the
heartbeat-induced motion [15].
This paper focuses on the last method i.e. systems where
both the image acquisition and processing delays and the
surgical robot’s dynamics must be accounted for. It expands
on the work previously done by Ginhoux et al. [13] and
Bowthorpe et al. [15], by aiming to develop a teleoper-
ated system guided by ultrasound images that follows the
heartbeat-induced motion of the POI for procedures per-
formed on the exterior surface or interior of the heart. Hence,
the image acquisition and processing delay is signiﬁcantly
larger than that in [13] where a 500 Hz camera as opposed
to a 28 Hz ultrasound scanner is used. Importantly, by using a
generalized predictive controller instead of a Smith predictor
as in [15], disturbances originating from the heart’s back-
and-forth motion can be rejected directly by the controller.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section III
reviews the generalized predictive control law and describes
the algorithms used to develop a beating-heart surgical sys-
tem. Section IV describes the experimental setup and results
that validate the proposed algorithm. The concluding remarks
are given in Section V.
III. PREDICTIVE FEEDBACK CONTROL LAW
This paper focuses on a surgical system that could be used
for procedures performed on both the exterior surface and the
interior of the heart. Hence, ultrasound images, which can
visualize through blood, are used to track the beating-induced
motion of the POI. This introduces an image acquisition
and processing delay of approximately 40 ms and 100 ms
[16], respectively. If this delay is not compensated for by the
control law, there is a risk that the surgical tool will collide
with and puncture the heart tissue. In addition, the surgical
robot is teleoperated from a surgeon’s console and hence the
control system must consider the surgical robot’s dynamics
to ensure the surgeon’s motions are accurately mimicked by
the surgical robot.

As mentioned previously, the position measurement of the
surgical tool tip is delayed. While this measurement in prin-
ciple can be obtained in real-time from an external position
sensor, this measurement will be with respect the surgical
tool’s reference frame and not the image frame. Note that
the goal is to control the surgical tool tip to follow the POI’s
motion, which is only known in the image frame. Although
the transformation between the surgical tool’s frame and the
image frame can theoretically be calculated, in a clinical
setting this is difﬁcult to do. For instance, if the ultrasound
probe moves, which is not rare in the operating room, the
transformation will need to be recalculated. A more robust
alternatively is to measure the surgical tool tip’s position in
the image frame directly, meaning that the position will not
be available until after the image acquisition and processing
delay, which the control system will need to compensate for.
A. OVERVIEW OF GENERALIZED PREDICTIVE CON-
TROL
Generalized predictive control was chosen due to its ability
to compensate for a time delay and to reject disturbances
caused by the heart motion [18]. In GPC, the system is
modeled by a controlled auto-regressive integrated moving
average (CARIMA) equation – see (1) – that includes a time
delay of d samples [18]. An overview of GPC is shown in
Fig. 2. The control signal is calculated by minimizing the
difference between the estimated system output (position)
and the given desired reference signal over a given horizon
while limiting the magnitude of the control signal. Therefore,
a model of the robot is required to estimate future outputs
based on current inputs and the known reference signal. The
reference signal is continually updated, and if the reference
signal includes the estimated heart motion as will be shown
later, it will be continually updated to reﬂect any changes in
the actual heart motion.
In order to design a GPC law, we begin with a CARIMA
model to describe the robot dynamics:

The goal of generalized predictive control is to minimize
the difference between the optimal prediction of the plant’s
future outputs given the current output ^ y[(k +j)TjkT ] and
the future reference values w[(k +j)T ] while keeping the

B. SURGICAL ROBOT CONTROL ALGORITHM
Two different approaches can be taken when developing
the GPC system for a robot-assisted beating-heart surgical
system. This choice stems from the fact that there are three
possible outputs from the processed images: the heart posi-
tion, the surgical tool position, and the distance between the
heart and the surgical tool. Each of these measurements will
be delayed the length of the image acquisition and processing
delay. The goal is to make the surgical tool follow the heart’s
motion and this can be done in two different ways. The ﬁrst
method, shown in Fig. 3, is to control the distance between
the surgical tool tip and the heart to follow the surgeon’s
commanded motion. In this case the reference signal w is
simply the surgeon’s motion, the controlled variabley is the
distance between the surgical tool tip and the heart, and the
heart’s motion is treated as an unknown disturbance. The
second method, shown in Fig. 4, is to directly control the
position of the surgical tool to follow the motion of the heart,
which is not known in real time. In this research an estimate
of the heart position is obtained by delaying the actual heart
position by the length of one heart beat. In this case the
tracking error is reduced to the difference between the heart
motion and the estimated heart motion. The reference signal
w is the sum of the surgeon’s motion and the estimated heart
motion and the controlled variable y is the surgical tool’s
position. In both ﬁgures the darker section is the physical
system that cannot be changed and the lighter section is
performed by software and can be changed.

the surgical tool tip is being controlled to follow the combination of the
estimated heart motion and the surgeon’s motion. The estimated heart
motion is calculated from the heart’s motion in the previous heart beat.
IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
The two proposed GPC control methods were tested
experimentally. A voice coil (NCC20-18-020-1X from H2W
Technologies Inc., Santa Clarita, CA, USA) shown in Fig.5
was used to actuate the surgical tool. The motion of the surgi-
cal tool and a simulated beating heart was captured using an
Hx60 MicronTracker from Claron Technology Inc., Toronto,
ON, Canada. The MicronTracker was chosen to represent
an ultrasound scanner because it has a similar frame rate of
20 Hz, which introduces an image acquisition and processing
delay of up to 50 ms. A Yaskawa Motoman Robot SIA5F
from Yaskawa Canada, Inc., Mississagua, ON, Canada was
used as a beating heart simulator. The experimental setup is
shown in Fig. 6 and a close up view of the surgical tool is
shown in Fig. 5.
To begin designing a GPC system to control the surgical
tool, an electromechanical model of the surgical robot must
be identiﬁed. This electromechanical model includes the
voice coil actuator and the corresponding analog circuitry
that converts the voltage setpoint to a current that drives the
voice coil actuator. The voice coil actuator was modeled as
that in [20] by Oboe et al. where relationship between the
input current and the velocity of the voice coil actuator is
V =

The inductance L and resistance R of the voice coil are
1.05 mH and 3.5 
, respectively, and the back EMF gain
K
t
is 6.1 V/m. The parameters J and B were found to be
-0.5264 and 16.2547 using least squares identiﬁcation.
Next, consistent with past literature [17] the Motoman
robot was programmed to move linearly in one direction in
the same fashion as the heart – see Heart Position in Figs. 7-
11. The Micron Tracker captured the motion of the Claron

black and white optical markers that were attached to the
robot arm and to the surgical tool. These markers will not be
needed later when the system uses an ultrasound scanner to
measure the motion. Each of the two methods of designing
the GPC described in Section III-B are implemented. The
control horizon was set to 3 and  = 0:00001.
First, the distance between the surgical tool and the heart is
controlled to follow the surgeon’s position. There is a 50 ms
delay in the loop due to image acquisition and processing
and the images are acquired at a rate of 20 Hz. The heart’s
motion is treated as a disturbance whose measurement is
available after the time delay. The result when the surgeon’s
motion is set to zero is shown in Fig. 7 where the dashed blue
line is the position of the simulated heart and the solid black
line is the position of the surgical tool tip. The mean value
of the position error is 12 mm and the integrated squared
error (ISE)
ISE =
1

(17)
where  is the position error and n is the number of data
points, is 205 mm
2
. The result when the surgeon’s motion is
a square wave with an amplitude of 3 mm and a frequency
of 2 Hz is shown in Fig. 8 where the dashed blue line is
the position of the simulated heart, the solid black line is the
position of the surgical tool tip, and the dash-dotted black
line is the surgeon’s motion. The mean value of the position
error is 8.9 mm and the ISE is 115 mm
2
. The errors are large
because the system is not given any information about the
disturbance (simulated heart motion) which has an amplitude
of 20 mm. Because of the time delay, the surgical tool tip
moves to correct for the heart’s motion with a delay.
Second, the surgical tool tip is controlled to follow the
combination of the estimated heart motion and the surgeon’s
motion. As a base for comparison, the surgical tool was ﬁrst
controlled to follow the simulated heart motion under no
delay using a proportional controller. The result is given in
Fig. 9. It is evident from this ﬁgure that the voice coil, under
the low sampling rate of 20 Hz, follows the motion with a

delay. Next the delay was returned and the GPC controller
was returned to the system. As before, there is a 50 ms
delay in the system due to image acquisition and processing
before the position of the heart is known. For simplicity,
the heart’s motion is delayed by one heartbeat cycle and
then used as a estimate of the current heart position. Now
the tracking error is the difference between the current and
estimated heart motion and the GPC does not have to reject
a large disturbance as in the previous case. The result when
the surgeon’s motion is set to zero is shown in Fig. 10 where
the dashed blue line is the position of the simulated heart and
the solid black line is the position of the surgical tool tip.

surgeon’s motion. The mean value of the position error is
8.1 mm and the ISE is 91 mm

. No additional error occurred
when the surgeon’s motion was added. These position errors
are smaller than those in the previous method, showing the
superiority of the second method.
V. CONCLUDING REMARKS
Developing a surgical system that controls a surgical tool
to follow the combination of the heart’s and the surgeon’s
motion is a challenging task for many reasons. The ﬁrst being
that the heart’s motion and the surgical tool’s motion are only
available after the image acquisition and processing delay.
If ultrasound images are used (in the case of this paper
camera images with delays similar to ultrasound images),

these delays can be larger than 50 ms. However, ultrasound
can visualize through blood and is therefore necessary for
intracardiac procedures. Secondly, the surgical tool must
follow the combination of the surgeon’s motion, which is
available in real-time, and the heart’s motion, which is not
available in real-time. The heart’s motion can be treated as
a disturbance that the control system must reject, but this
is difﬁcult as the heart moves quickly with velocities up
to 210 mm/s and accelerations up to 3800 mm/s
2
. In this
paper a generalized predictive controller was implemented
in two different manners to make the surgical tool follow
the combination of the heart’s and surgeon’s motion. The
ﬁrst treated the heart’s motion as a disturbance and controlled
the distance between the heart and surgical tool to follow the
surgeon’s motion. The second method estimated the heart’s
motion based on previous motion and controlled the surgical
tool to follow the combination of the surgeon’s motion and
the estimated heart motion. Because a large disturbance was
not present in the second GPC method, the mean error was
reduced to 8.1 mm from 12 mm in the ﬁrst GPC method.
Fig. 11. The result of controlling the surgical tool to follow the estimated
heart position. In this case the surgeon’s motion is a square wave with an
amplitude of 3 mm and a frequency of 2 Hz. The diagram of this system
is given in Fig. 4.
In closing, this paper shows that GPC can be used to create
a robot-assisted beating-heart surgical system because it can
account for both the image acquisition and processing delay
and the large disturbance created by the beating heart.
