Robotic Force Ampliﬁcation with Free Space Motion Capability
Pascal D. Labrecque and Cl´ ement Gosselin
Abstract— A control algorithm based on admittance regu-
lation is proposed for human-robot cooperative force ampli-
ﬁcation. The controller is particularly suitable for physical
interaction in both free space and constrained motions thanks
to an active transition between the two modes. It is also
able to cancel possible high frequency oscillations due to
the contact with the environment. A mathematical analysis
of the controller is provided and a preliminary experimental
validation is performed on a 1-dof test-bench.
I. INTRODUCTION
In recent years, human-robot interaction (HRI) has at-
tracted a great deal of attention in the robotics community,
mainly because of the signiﬁcant potential beneﬁts of an
active collaboration between humans and robots [1]. The
help of a robotic assistant is indeed highly desirable for
precision tasks, heavy load manipulation, rehabilitation and
many other tasks. Moreover, the quality and the accessibility
of the different interactive sensors allow researchers to de-
velop more effective and intuitive interfaces. The most direct
interaction between humans and robots is through physical
contact. In such a situation, the communication is therefore
mainly accomplished via the interaction forces.
In industry, this approach has been applied to the assisted
manipulation of heavy loads [2]. Moreover, some of the
assistive devices recently developed can actively interpret the
operator’s intention to move the payload and make use of
static balancing to reduce the required power [3], [4]. This
kind of physical-HRI (pHRI) is also used in exoskeletons,
sometimes called body extenders. In this context, the actions
are completely commanded by the human operator inside the
robotic suit [5], [6]. pHRI in free space can be formulated
as an admittance control problem [3]. However, if a contact
with the environment is required, the dynamics of the system
changes and becomes more complex [7]. Furthermore, in
order to obtain a real assistance from the robot, the force
applied by the operator should be augmented at the end-
effector. It is therefore desirable to implement a controller
that can take into account both free space and constrained
situations. An early solution to this problem was formulated
in [8] using the concept of Virtual Tool Dynamics. More
recently, [9] presented a force ampliﬁcation controller for
industrial applications, but emphasized the constrained case.

Currently, the most common application of pHRI is for
assistive surgical systems. The interaction can take place
through telerobotics [10] with a force feedback to a haptic
device manipulated by the operator, or through direct contact
with the surgical robot [11]–[13]. An interesting approach is
presented in [10] where the master PI controller switches to a
simple P controller when the force sensed between the slave
and the environment exceeds a certain threshold in order to
keep the system stable. Similarly, [13] uses adaptive fuzzy
logic for the inner position control loop to handle the varying
resistive forces of the parallel robot mechanism. The major
differences between the medical and the industrial ﬁelds are
the range of the working space and the force enhancement
sensed on the operator side. Indeed, the displacement and
the force applied by the surgeon are decreased at the tool
for more precision whereas force ampliﬁcation and large
workspaces are required in industrial applications. These
differences lead to quite similar control architectures but to
different physical issues to be addressed. For instance, if the
operator force input is ampliﬁed at the end-effector, there is
a higher risk of exciting the system into an unstable mode,
especially when a high velocity contact occurs with a rigid
surface. Industrial cooperation robots must deal with larger
workspaces, higher velocities and larger forces, but they still
need precision for complex tasks.
In this paper, an effective force ampliﬁcation controller
based on the admittance model presented in [3] is proposed
for pHRI industrial applications. The ﬁrst section of the paper
describes the proposed control architecture. The second
section investigates the impact of the different parameters
on the dynamics of the system, brieﬂy recalls the free space
motion control law [3], and presents a continuous control
law used for mode transition. The third section presents a
discontinuous control law that allows the system to cancel
undesirable behaviours. The last section provides an experi-
mental demonstration of the controller’s effectiveness. Here,
the term free space motion refers to the mode in which the
robot end-effector is able to move in its free space with the
help of a physical interaction. By contrast, in the constrained
mode, the human interaction helps the robot end-effector to
rest against a rigid environment and apply a force.
II. CONTROL ARCHITECTURE
Cooperative force ampliﬁcation implies a direct contact
between the robot and the human operator, and thus force
sensors are required to measure the operator input and the
environment output. For simpliﬁcation purposes, the analysis
and the experiments presented in this paper are developed for
a one-degree-of-freedom (dof) robot. Therefore, the system

includes only two force sensors, one for the input and one
for the output. However, the proposed approach is easily
extended to a multi-dof robot using the Jacobian matrix.
If the robot is in contact with its environment and no
motion is possible, it is easy to implement a direct force
control with a certain ampliﬁcation factor included in the
loop [12]. However, when the system is not constrained
by its environment and is required to move freely in its
working space, the direct force control becomes inefﬁcient
for a precise positioning or for velocity control. Force control
alone is thus not an adequate option for a system that must
be able to operate in both constrained and free spaces. A
possible approach to address the latter issue is admittance
control, which allows the transformation of a force into
a motion, namely position or velocity [3], [9], [13]. The
admittance is derived from the impedance that captures the
relationship between motion and force. These two terms
have been loosely used in the literature in the past years,
but for the purposes of this paper impedance represents the
transformation of a motion into a force while admittance
represents the opposite, as stated previously.

tive force controller. Variables f

are the desired position, the actual position, and the error
between these two positions while is the torque command
to the robot. The controller includes two loops, namely, an
inner loop for the precise positioning and an outer loop for
the transformation of the different forces interacting with the
robot into desired motions. The components of the controller
are explained in more detail in the following subsections.
A. Inner Position Control Loop
The ﬁrst basic principle when using admittance control is
to include an inner motion control. This controller, repre-
sented by C in Fig. 1, is used to follow a desired velocity
or position. In the context of force ampliﬁcation, a position
control is more intuitive considering the strong relationship
between a displacement and a force acting on an object
having a certain stiffness (Hooke’s law). Furthermore, the
possibility to use the same controller for autonomous free
space motion is an advantage. Since an integral term in the
feedback loop introduces a pole in the system dynamics,
thereby compromising its stability, it is wise to choose a PD
controller. Indeed, the derivative action introduces a zero that
provides phase lead, and thus tends to stabilize the closed-
loop system. The PD control law is written as
 =k
p
(x
ref
 x)+k
d
(_ x
ref
  _ x) (1)
where k
p
and k
d
are respectively the proportional and the
derivative gains.
B. Outer Force Control Loop
The second basic component of an admittance control
architecture is the transformation of the input force into a
motion command. Typically, the relationship is of the form
f =m( x   x
t
)+c(_ x  _ x
t
)+k(x x
t
) (2)
where f is the external force, m, c, and k are respectively
the virtual inertia, damping and stiffness,  x, _ x, andx are the
acceleration, the velocity, and the position, and ﬁnally,  x
t
, _ x
t
,
andx
t
represent the desired trajectory to be followed. Since
the input is coming from a physical interaction, the latter
three variables should be set to zero. The virtual stiffness,k,
should also be equal to zero in order to obtain a free motion.
The relationship is then rewritten as follows
f =m x+c_ x: (3)
It is then easy to solve the above equation for the velocity
in the Laplace domain, yielding
_
X(s) =
1
ms+c
F(s) =

c
m
c
s+1
F(s) =Y(s)F(s) (4)
where
_
X(s) and F(s) are respectively the Laplace trans-
forms of _ x and f, and s is the Laplace variable.
Since there is a force ampliﬁcation situation, a feedback
from the sensed environment force is necessary. An appar-
ently simple solution for the control model would be to
use the admittance with the error between the command
and measured external forces. However, force sensors are
typically noisy and subtracting force signals is therefore
not a desirable approach, especially because one of the
force signals is ampliﬁed. It is therefore preferable to use
an admittance for each sensed force. With this approach,
a ﬁltering effect is introduced before any ampliﬁcation or
subtraction process. The outer force control law is then based
on the following relationships

III. CONTROLLER PARAMETERS
A. Stability limits
Stability is of paramount importance in pHRI. Assessing
stability is a difﬁcult problem that generally requires more
than simple simulations, mainly because of the difﬁculty
to accurately model human input. Also, relative stability,
characterized by a constant oscillation around a steady state,
is also an unwanted situation that is more difﬁcult to predict
than clear divergence. Relative stability produces vibrations
and is mostly encountered in the constrained mode because
of the particular system dynamics [7]. Indeed, in this situ-
ation, the environment stiffness, sensor dynamics, and low-
pass ﬁltering alter the stability bandwidth, and the controller
becomes thus less tolerant to high frequency inputs. This is a
common issue in force control, and it is one major reason to
pay a special attention to stability in the constrained mode.
Dynamic linear models of the prototype and the envi-
ronment described in subsection V-A have been determined
experimentally in order to simulate the robot behaviour.
With the constrained system model, the stability limit in
terms of the admittance parameters has been estimated and
is shown in Fig. 2. In this case, Y
o
and Y
e
are identical,

o
= 1, and 
e
= 1=3. In simulation, the gain and phase
margins of the open-loop system have been used to assess
the stability boundary. The system is considered stable if the
gain margin is greater than 0dB and the phase margin is
greater than 0

. Experimentally, when the system was not
relatively stable it was not considered stable. The region
of instability determined experimentally is larger than the
region determined by simulation. This can be explained by
two factors. The ﬁrst one is the nonlinearities of the system
that were not considered in the simulation and the second one
is the discontinuous contact with the environment when large

oscillations occur. It should also be noticed, when looking at
the phase margin trend, that, in order to obtain a more robust
system, a smallm=c ratio is needed. Another parameter that
affects the response stability is the ampliﬁcation factor 
e
.
In simulation, the system becomes unstable when 
e
> 1:7
while experimentally it becomes unstable when 
e
> 0:45.
In summary, in order to obtain the best performance, the
admittance parameters should be as small as possible without
crossing the stability limit while 
e
, on the other hand,
should be as large as possible also without crossing its own
stability limit.
B. Ampliﬁcation for Low and High Admittances
1) Continuous Control Law During Free Space Motion:
The ﬁrst order system deﬁned in (4) has a well-known
behaviour in the time domain. It is therefore easy to infer
the effect of the parameters on the system response for a
free space motion situation, namely, the virtual damping
deﬁnes the response’s steady state magnitude while the ratio
of the virtual inertia over the virtual damping deﬁnes the time
required to reach this steady state. The resulting dynamics,
when applying an external force, can be considered as that
of a mass, m, moving in a viscous environment of damping
coefﬁcient, c. Therefore, if the admittance parameters are
high then the robot will be less reactive to the sensed force.
On the other hand, if they are low it will be easier to move
the robot, but more difﬁcult to control it for precise motion.
In fact, it has been shown that the most intuitive pHRI can
be obtained by varying the admittance parameters online
according to the operator’s intentions [3], [14], [15]. The
approach proposed in [3] is used here and is now brieﬂy
recalled. In this approach, the effective damping coefﬁcient,
noted c
ov
, is calculated based on the nominal (default)
damping coefﬁcient, c
o
, and the desired acceleration,  x
d
,
using
c
ov
=c
o
  x
d
(13)
where parameter  is used to adjust the inﬂuence of the
acceleration on the variation of c
ov
. When it is desired to
accelerate, the virtual damping decreases and the effective
virtual inertia, notedm
ov
, is also adjusted in order to keep a
constant ratio of damping over inertia, which makes it easier
136
to move the robot for larger acelerations. However, when it
is desired to decelerate, the virtual damping increases, and
the virtual inertia partially decreases. The following relations
are used to adjust the virtual inertia

parameters that are used to respectively adjust the steady
state inertia to damping ratio and the rate of the transition.
In the above, the desired acceleration,  x
d
, is computed using
a discrete form of (6).
2) Transition between Free Space Motion and Con-
strained Force Ampliﬁcation: As explained in the latter
subsection, in a constrained situation the properties of the
environment strongly affect the dynamics of the system.
In fact, the stiffness and damping of the contact surface
reduce the closed-loop stability bandwidth. On the control
architecture side, the feedback admittance can also contribute
to instability by acting like a low-pass ﬁlter. The admittance
parameters should therefore be chosen carefully. First, both
virtual dynamic systems should be identical in order to
behave similarly in the process while parameters 
o
and

e
take care of the ampliﬁcation. Moreover, considering Y
o
and Y
e
as low-pass ﬁlters, it becomes obvious that it is not
desirable to have one force signal ﬁltered more severely than
the other before the subtraction operation is applied. Second,
the operator and the environment admittance parameters
should be as low as possible while remaining numerically
stable. Indeed, lowering these parameters leads to better
performances but also reduces the interaction bandwidth, i.e.,
the robustness. The virtual damping parameters are particu-
larly important because if they are too high the response
contains uncontrolable overshoot while if they are too low
the stability limit is reached.
A recurrent issue for hybrid position/force control algo-
rithms is the jittering effect that appears when the controller
is ﬂickering between two states. In the context considered
here, the robot should react to two different dynamics,
namely, free space and constrained space. In order to obtain
the best performances for each case, the controller should
take into account these two different modes. The advantage
of the admittance control approach proposed here over a
hybrid approach is that the behaviour of the controller can be
easily modiﬁed by a parameter variation without changing
the controller architecture (no commutation). Using this
feature, it is then possible to deﬁne a smooth transition
between the free space and constrained motion controls.
This transition should allow the robot end-effector to stay
on the contact surface when no input force is applied.
Moreover, this should not create a sticking effect when a rapid
pull back from a contact surface is attempted. Hence, the
transition control law consists simply in varying the effective
damping and inertia parameters. This control law is applied
when the external contact force between the robot and the

= 0:9N, and
amp
= 3:1. The virtual
damping changes from 8 to 6:5Ns=m, and the virtual inertia
changes from 1 to 0:007kg.
The dynamics of the force ampliﬁcation situation can be
viewed as two mass-damping systems pushing against one
another. When no input force is applied by the operator, the
whole system tends to return to its equilibrium, i.e., a zero
environment force. If one of the two inertias is larger, or
if one of the two damping coefﬁcients is smaller, then the
system tends to overshoot on the other side. This explains
the need for a smooth increase of the operator admittance
parameters when the system approaches the critical zone
of zero environment force. It is also understood that if an
environment force is sensed, the transition law prevails over
the continuous control law, but that if a fast pull back is
attempted, the transition law is bypassed because of its small
effective range of operation.
C. Ampliﬁcation Factors
As shown above, in a constrained situation in which Y
o
and Y
e
have the same admittance parameters as well as
small inertias, the force ampliﬁcation  is solely dependent
on 
o
and 
e
. In this case, one should use both factors
137
to generate the ampliﬁcation, rather than only one. Indeed,
each factor has a signiﬁcant impact on the system response.
Moreover, they represent different speciﬁcations due to their
location in the force control loop. The ﬁrst important feature
is the change in the feedback steady state gain, given by the
variation of 
e
, that has a direct incidence on the stability
of the system. An increase of this gain positively affects its
performance but may also compromise its stability if too
high. The second feature is the change in the command
steady state gain, given by the variation of 
o
, that controls
directly the magnitude of the velocity command. Therefore,
this parameter complements the ﬁrst one in order to obtain
the desired force ampliﬁcation . A variation of 
o
has
practically no impact on the stability of the system when

e
is chosen appropriately and remains constant. The effect
of these factors on the control loop will be demonstrated in
the upcoming sections.
IV. OSCILLATION CANCELLER
The effect of the different control parameters was estab-
lished in the preceding section, which led to the develop-
ment of a stable and fast ampliﬁcation controller by proper
adjustment of the force control loop. However, one issue
remains to be addressed in order to make the controller fully
reliable, namely the possible occurrence of oscillations for
high frequency inputs when admittance parameters are low.
A straightforward approach to resolve this issue would be to
slightly increase the admittance parameters. Unfortunately,
such an approach would slow down the response. Instead, it
is proposed here to keep both admittance parameters as low
as possible without instability and to actively modify the
ampliﬁcation factors. An appropriate discontinuous variation
of the admittance steady state gains through
o
and
e
allows
the system to be fast and precise for low to medium fre-
quency inputs, and to cancel oscillations for high frequency
inputs. The following algorithm is introduced in order to
implement this approach.

cancel the initiation of an oscillation. Condition (i) limits
the output response when the time derivative of the input
command exceeds a certain maximum value. It allows the
system to remain stable for high frequency command when it
is in a constrained situation. Condition (ii) limits the output
response when the time derivative of the output exceeds a
certain maximum value. It is especially useful for a fast
impact situation with a rigid object wheref
o
is already high
and
_
f
o
does not necessarily vary so much. Equation (21)
preserves the general ampliﬁcation relationship.
In other words, the Oscillation Canceller (OC) proposed
above allows the process to respond slowly when the time
derivative of the force input becomes too large, so as to
remain passive with respect to the environment. The force
control bandwidth is therefore temporarily augmented. Fur-
thermore, the OC can be seen as a safe switch that counters
fast impulse perturbations or inputs.
V. EXPERIMENTATION
A. Experimental setup
The novel admittance controller proposed above was val-
idated experimentally using a simple one-dof robot. The
experimental setup is shown in Fig. 4. It consists of a
single revolute joint, a 130mm arm, two single-axis force
sensors, and an actuator. One of the force sensors receives
the operator input while the other one measures the force
generated by the actuator and the operator on the envi-
ronment. The operator sensor is limited to 5kg and the
environment sensor is limited to 20kg. Both sensors are
Phidgets Micro Load Cells. The actuator is a Pittman DC
Servo Gearmotor with a gearbox ratio of 65.5:1 and an
encoder of 500CPR. The maximum theoretical force that can
be generated by the actuator at the end-effector is 26N. The
control algorithm is developed with Simulink and RT-LAB.
It is then implemented on a real-time QNX computer with a
sampling period of 2ms.
Since the effectiveness of the free space motion control
law was demonstrated in [3], the experimental section of
this paper focuses on the constrained situation and the mode
transition. Three important properties should be veriﬁed in a
human-robot force ampliﬁcation context in order to ensure
a natural cooperation, namely: (i) the ampliﬁcation itself,

performance so as to achieve the most natural interaction, and
(iii) the occurrence of vibrations that should be cancelled
for efﬁciency and safety reasons. The performance of the
controller proposed in this paper is demonstrated with the
experiments described in the following subsections.
B. Force Ampliﬁcation for Low and High Admittances, and
High Virtual Inertia
The ﬁrst experiment consists in the pursuit of an approx-
imately sinusoidal signal manually generated by an operator
with an amplitude of 7.5N, a mean value of 12.5N, and a fre-
quency of approximately 0.4Hz. Three tests were conducted
with different sets of parameters in order to assess the track-
ing performance. The results for a duration of 7.2 seconds are
shown in Fig. 5. Figure 5(a) shows the response with low
admittance parameters (m = 0:007kg and c = 6:5Ns=m)
and an ampliﬁcation of 4 times the operator input (
o
= 1:6
and 
e
= 0:4). These admittance parameters are the default
ones for a regular operation, and Y
o
and Y
e
are always
similar in constrained mode. Figure 5(b) represents a high
admittance situation with the same virtual inertia to virtual
damping ratio used for the low admittance experiment. As
an alternative to directly changing the admittance parameters
the ampliﬁcation factors are reduced while keeping  = 4
(
o
= 0:8 and 
e
= 0:2). Reducing the admittance steady-
state gains leads to a phase shift of the response. Figure 5(c)
shows the response obtained with larger virtual inertia values
(m = 0:7kg andc = 6:5Ns=m) and the default ampliﬁcation
factors. In fact, when the virtual inertia to virtual damping
ratio is larger, the response is slower and more overshoots
arise.
Figure 5(d) shows the error between the operator input and
the environment output for each case. The low admittance

case seems to give better results than the other two. This
is conﬁrmed by the residual sum of squares (RSS), given
in Table I, for the 7.2 seconds time period of evaluation.
In the experiment reported here, the high virtual inertia
performs relatively well, but with the combination of human
interaction and overshoot it can become unpredictable, and
hence damaging for the response.

C. Continuous Interaction - Unconstrained to Constrained
Environment
The second experiment demonstrates how the system
behaves for a continuous interaction between the free and
the constrained spaces. The interaction consists of a dis-
placement induced by the operator force input, followed by
a contact with a stiff environment where the ampliﬁcation is
initiated, then followed by a fast pull back to ﬁnally return to
a displacement in free space. Figure 6 depicts this particular
situation with the default admittance parameters. The input
(reference) and the response (encoder) velocities of the inner
position control loop are shown in Fig. 6(a). Velocity plots
are shown instead of position plots because they are thought
to be more relevant when a physical human interaction
feedback is involved. Moreover, the operator force input and
the environment force response are represented in Fig. 6(b).
As expected, it can be observed that an accurate tracking of
the reference velocity (resulting of the operator force input)
and a zero environment force are obtained in the free space
motion mode. On the contrary, and also as expected, an
accurate tracking between the operator and the environment
forces, and a zero encoder velocity are observed in the
constrained mode. In the latter mode, the reference velocity

becomes the error between the two ampliﬁed admittance
outputs, as seen in Fig. 1. This error will then reach zero
for a steady-state. An interesting behaviour of the controller
is shown during the fast pull back (at the end of the force
ampliﬁcation stage). In fact, even if there is no sticking
effect, as it is observable for the second transition of Fig.
6(b), there is a slight phase shift of the encoder velocity
due to the high value of the reference velocity when the
robot initiates its motion. For a reference velocity below the
saturation limits of 3rad=s the operator should not feel
any constraint or inconvenience. The impact of the gearbox
backlash is also noticeable on the velocity response when
changing directions.
D. Impulse Response - Unconstrained to Constrained Envi-
ronment
The third experiment reported here is a fast impulse from
the unconstrained (f
e
= 0) to the constrained environment,
followed by a constant force input of 3N. In this case, the
ampliﬁcation is 5 times the operator input (
o
= 2 and

e
= 0:4). Fig. 7 shows two tests, one without the oscillation
canceller (a), and one with the oscillation canceller (b).
The OC parameters are set to

= 0:16sec,

= 0:4N,

f

= 120Ns=m. With
the OC, all major vibrations or fast impulses are eliminated
and the system is therefore able to follow the ampliﬁed input.
The impact of the transition law is also noticeable in Fig. 7.
Indeed, when the operator force is released, there is a smooth
return to zero of the environment force belowf
emax
= 0:9N.
As a result, the robot end-effector stays on the contact surface
without applying any force.
E. Video Demonstration
The accompanying video demonstrates all situations to
be addressed by the controller, namely, free space motion,
constrained force ampliﬁcation and transition between the
two. The video also illustrates the stability and effectiveness
of the controller for fast pull back and sharp contacts
(impulses) with a stiff environment. It can be observed that
the controller is always stable and that it leads to a very
intuitive behaviour. The ampliﬁcation of the force is also
illustrated visually using two identical deformable objects.
VI. CONCLUSION
A novel force ampliﬁcation controller for pHRI was
presented in this paper. The controller uses the principle of
variable admittance in order to optimize the free space and
constrained motions. The effect of the different parameters in
the force control loop was assessed and explained. Moreover,
the experimental results demonstrate that the new approach
leads to an intuitive and effective force ampliﬁcation control,
with the help of a smooth transition law and the oscillation
canceller. Current work includes the application of the con-
troller to a multi-dof robot.
