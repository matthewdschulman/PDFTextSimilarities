Abstract—In this research, omnidirectional crawler unit with 
the torus configuration is proposed. It is composed of two 
curved crawler belts whose inner and outer trajectories have the 
same length. The prototype is designed and developed. The 
basic motion of the prototype is confirmed experimentally. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
In order to realize holonomic omnidirectional motion, 
there exist many commercial wheels which are based on small 
passive rotational wheels[1]. Some of them are similar to a 
crawler-like mechanism. However, these crawler-like 
mechanisms have many numbers of small passive rotational 
rollers, and are not generally capable of overcoming steps or 
ground discontinuities because of the very small diameter of 
the passive wheel. Therefore, we developed the 
omnidirectional crawler mechanism with circular cross 
section with the active rotational axis at the center of the 
crawler mechanism[2]. 
II. BASIC CONCEPT OF TORUS OMNIDIRECTIONAL 
DRIVING UNIT MECHANISM 
The basic concept of the torus omnidirectional driving unit 
mechanism is shown in Fig. 1. By rotating the active central 
axis, the unit realizes smooth motions in arbitrary directions.  
    
Figure 1.  Conventional Torus Driving Mechanisms[3] 
Conventional torus mechanisms have passive rollers, 
therefore if there is some obstacle, the roller can be moved 
from its initial position and the inner mechanism could be 
exposed like the right image of Fig. 1[3].  Therefore, the 
supporting part of the mechanism at the center must be fixed. 
III. PROTOTYPE MODEL OF THE UNIT MECHANISM 
The basic configuration of the prototype model is shown in 
Fig. 2. The mechanism to put the driving force to the belt is the 
tooth belt. By combining two curved units with the same 
center, the circular cross section is realized. Fig. 3(a) shows

Figure 4.  Velocities of the Crawler on Contact Points A and B 
the inner mechanism and the whole configuration is shown in 
Fig. 3(b).  Its specifications are shown in Table 1. In order to 
confirm the uniform velocity of the whole outer surface of the 
torus omnidirectional driving unit, we compared the velocities 
on the contact point A and B on the outer surface in Fig. 2. The 
result is shown in Fig. 4. There is not a significant difference 
between these two velocities, so the velocity at the whole 
surface can be considered almost the same and uniform.
