I. INTRODUCTION
Technological advancements over the last decade have
provided signiﬁcant improvements in existing cardiovascular
procedures and have enabled treatment to high-risk pa-
tients who were initially declined surgery [1]–[5]. Valve-
related diseases such as severe symptomatic aortic stenosis
require treatment by open heart aortic valve replacement
with cardiopulmonary bypass, which is often considered a
high-risk procedure for elderly with comorbidities [3], [5],
[6]. However, an alternative method for treatment of aortic
stenosis is provided by transfemoral (TF) or transapical (TA)
transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TA VI) [3], [7], [8].
TF- and TA-TA VI are considered complementary. The TF-
approach is considered to be the ﬁrst option, while the
TA-approach is considered if there are contraindications to
the transfemoral route such as severe calciﬁcation of the
aortic arch or descending aorta and limited dimensions of
iliac and femoral arteries [5], [9]. The transapical approach
provides direct surgical access through the apex of the

Fig. 1. Transapical transcatheter aortic valve implantation can be performed
using a robotically-actuated delivery sheath (RADS) to improve valve
positioning. The RADS 1  is inserted through the apex 2  into the left
ventricle 3  and oriented perpendicular to the aortic annulus 4  for co-
axial alignment. The articulating tip 5  of the RADS can be controlled
inside the left ventricle under ultrasound image-guidance in two degrees-
of-freedom by two pairs of antagonistically-conﬁgured tension wires. This
enables manipulation of a catheter inside the RADS, and can potentially

heart [7]. Complications in TA-TA VI such as prosthetic valve
malpositioning have been reported [5], [8], [9]. Malposition-
ing could cause severe peri-prosthetic aortic regurgitation,
valve embolization and occlusion of arteries which often
requires conversion to surgical aortic valve replacement with
cardiopulmonary bypass or a valve-in-valve procedure [10].
Therefore, the success of the procedure is closely related to
accurate valve orientation, positioning and deployment.
Integration of robotic devices in TA VI can provide accu-
rate valve positioning and compensation for beating heart
and respiration motions to improve outcome of the proce-
dure, and to reduce risks. A commercially-available robotic
catheter, Artisan
R 
Control Catheter (Hansen Medical, Moun-
tain View, CA) has been reported to treat people for atrial ﬁb-
rillation ablation [11]. Further, Jayender and Patel developed
an actuated catheter system, and demonstrated navigation
through the vascular system with potential applications in
angioplasty and atrial ﬁbrillation ablation [12]. However,
neither of these systems have demonstrated applicability for
TA VI-related procedures. Li et al. described a robotic system
capable of TA-TA VI under magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) [13], [14]. But MR-imaging does not allow visualiza-
tion of the existing catheters used in TA VI-related procedures
without the use of markers. Another study by Kesner et
al. demonstrated an actuated catheter system capable of
tracking fast moving cardiac tissue using three-dimensional

(3D) ultrasound [15]. However, tracking was limited to
one degree-of-freedom (DOF) in that study. Vasilyev et al.
demonstrated a percutaneous steerable robotic tool delivery
platform using pre-bent concentric tubes robot to treat patent
foramen ovale [16]. Although the pre-bent concentric tubes
robot could be adapted for valve delivery using transapical
access, the design provides limited capabilities to compensate
for respiratory and beating heart motions.
As an alternative to robotic catheters, a robotically-
actuated delivery sheath (RADS) allows existing TA VI
catheters to be manipulated such that valve positioning can
be provided (Fig. 1). The articulating tip of the RADS can
be controlled in two DOF. This allows for co-axial alignment
between the prosthetic valve and the aortic annulus. Another
important feature that can be provided is compensation for
beating heart and respiratory motions during valve deploy-
ment. The goal of our study is to describe an integrated
system that contains the modeling and ultrasound-guided
control of the RADS.
A. Related work
Our work builds on two main areas of research: Mod-
eling of continuum-type surgical robotic instruments and
ultrasound tracking. Modeling is a key aspect which de-
scribes the RADS shape and articulating tip position. Mod-
eling of continuum-type robots have been investigated by
several groups [17]–[22]. Various continuum-type robotic
instruments have been described in literature. These can
be broadly classiﬁed into tendon-driven manipulators and
pre-bent concentric tubes. In our study, we describe the
kinematics of the tendon-driven constant-curvature RADS
using a robot-speciﬁc and -independent submapping [18].
Another important aspect, is tracking of the RADS which
provides feedback for closed-loop control. In TA VI, the
surgeon is often assisted by 2D and 3D Transesophageal
echocardiography or Transthoracic echocardiography [7].
2D and 3D tracking methods of ﬂexible instruments using
2D ultrasound have been reported [23]–[26]. Further, 3D
ultrasound-based tracking of cardiac catheters (some accom-
modated with markers) have also been investigated [27], [28].
We focus on tracking using 2D ultrasound images, which we
intend to expand to 3D ultrasound in future studies.
B. Contributions
Our preliminary study describes and demonstrates that
the RADS can be potentially used to assist the surgeon in
accurate valve positioning within the aortic annulus (Fig. 1).
This paper focuses on robotically-assisted TA-TA VI to treat
aortic stenosis, but could potentially be applied in other
applications in cardiovascular surgery. A model that de-
scribes the RADS shape and tip position is used to accuratly
control its articulating tip. We also develop a 2D ultrasound
tracking method to provide tip feedback of the RADS.
We combined ultrasound tracking with RADS modeling in
order to provide model-based closed-loop control. This novel
integrated system facilitates articulating tip positioning of the
RADS under ultrasound closed-loop control. We evaluate the

robotically-actuated delivery sheath (RADS). The articulating tip of the
RADS is actuated in two degrees-of-freedom by two pairs (red and green)
of antagonistic-conﬁgured tension wires driven by a two pulleys (only
one illustrated). The various coordinate systems are used in modeling to
evaluate the tip pose of the RADS. The reference frame (

plane. The angle () is used to describe the orientation of the arc plane
with respect to the x-axis of the reference frame (

II. METHODS
This section explains the methods to enable closed-loop
model-based control of the RADS under ultrasound image-
guidance. First we describe device modeling of the RADS.
Subsequently, we provide a method to track the RADS in 2D
ultrasound images. Finally, we elaborate our control strategy
to facilitate closed-loop control.
A. Device modeling
The design of the tendon-driven RADS used to ma-
nipulate a catheter is shown in Fig. 2. The articulating
tip of the RADS is actuated in two DOF by two pairs
of antagonistically-conﬁgured tension wires. Each pair of
tension wires is actuated by a single pulley. This alows tip
movement in 2D by using two actuators instead of three,
that are required in a device with three tension wires. A
general model of a tendon-driven continuum-type robot can
be described by two mappings [18]. The ﬁrst mapping which
is often referred to as the robot-speciﬁc mapping, maps the
actuator-space onto the conﬁguration-space. The actuator-
space is described by the angles of the pulleys ( 
x
and 
y
),
while the conﬁguration-space is described by arc parameters
curvature (), arc plane angle () and arc length (`). The
second mapping (robot-independent mapping) transforms the
4381
arc parameters (, and`) of the conﬁguration-space to the
task space (intermediate frame (	
i
)).
In order to evaluate the arc parameters of the
conﬁguration-space, the relation between tendon manipu-
lation at the base and the resulting arc needs to be de-
scribed. In the derivation presented, we denote, c

= cos()
and s

= sin(), for notational simplicity. Our RADS is
actuated using four tendons (t
i
), where (i = 1; ; 4) with
corresponding tendon lengths (l
i
) (Fig. 2). From Webster and
Jones we obtain the relationship between the arc length of the
RADS (`) and the arc length of a single tendon (l
i
) by [18]

denotes the distance
between the backbone and the individual tendon, as depicted
in Fig. 2. Note, that the distance (d

for all tendons. Further,

describes the angle between
the bending direction of the RADS and the location of a
single tendon (t

illustrated in Fig. 2, we can describe the individual tendon

the RADS (Fig. 3). A representative ultrasound image of the
RADS submerged in a water container is shown in Fig. 3(a).
The ultrasound images show the semi-circular shape which
describes the surface reﬂection of the RADS. A semi-circular
shape with identical radius is not found within anatomical
structures of the beating heart. This allows for segmentation
of RADS based on circular shape parameters. Further, the
contrast between device and the environment is sufﬁciently
large for edge detection.
Before edge detection can be applied, we use a 2D
Gaussian kernel to reduce speckle and to smoothen edges in
the ultrasound image (Fig. 3(b)). A Canny edge detector with
hysteresis thresholding is used to evaluate an edge map of the
ultrasound image (Fig. 3(c)) [29]. Hysteresis thresholding is
used to reduce detection of irrelevant edges, which do not de-
scribe the surface the RADS. However, surface deformations
by artifacts and bending of the device, or irrelevant edges
may still be present. Hence, the centroid location is evaluated
using a random sample consensus (RANSAC) algorithm
(Algorithm. 1) that is robust to deformations and irrelevant
edges that do not describe the surface of the RADS [29].
The set (A) of edge points (x) are evaluated from the
Canny edge detector and provided as an input to the
RANSAC algorithm. The algebraic circle model parame-
ters (m) are ﬁtted (f : H ! m) to a set (H) of three
randomly selected (from A) candidate inliers. A prelimi-
nary test

is performed to determine if the
evaluated model parameters such as radius and location are
consistent with those of the RADS. Subsequently, we use a
cost function
 
C(m;x)

to evaluate all data points of the
edge map against the ﬁtted model (i.e., sufﬁciently close
to the periphery of the circular shape). The ﬁtted model
is acceptable if a sufﬁciently large portion of the surface
(semi-circle) has been evaluated as the consensus set. The
model parameters and consensus set are both reﬁned if the
computed cost (J
k
) of the current iteration is larger than
the previous best cost evaluated from a preceding iteration.
The localization accuracy of the RADS increases if the num-
ber (n) of iterations of the RANSAC algorithm are increased.
We empirically determine the relation between the number
of iterations and the localization error using a ground truth
measurement obtained after 10
6
iterations (Fig 3(e)). Aftern
iterations are completed, the best consensus set is used to re-

prone to noise, and the device tip may not always be detected
during tracking. Therefore, an EKF can be used to model
process and measurement noise in order to provide state
estimation based on both model and measurements. The
position error (e2 R

) is obtained by e =p ^ p, and
is used to close the loop. Further, no measurement of the
RADS in the z-axis of frame (

2D ultrasound. In order to limit the articulating tip motion
to the 2D ultrasound image plane, positioning of the RADS
along thez-axis of frame (

model-based controller.

by e, which is used to provide closed-loop control, and as an input to the
EKF with a gain (K).
III. EXPERIMENTS AND VALIDATION
This section describes the experimental evaluation of the
RADS. First, we explain the experimental setup used to con-
trol the RADS. Subsequently, we describe the experiments
performed in order to evaluate the performance of our RADS.
Finally, we discuss our experimental results.
A. Experimental Setup
The experimental setup used to control the articulating
tip of the RADS is shown in Fig. 5. The design of the
actuated delivery sheath is based on a cable-ring structure
surrounded by a hinged-tube (DEAM Corporation, Ams-
terdam, The Netherlands) [31]. The device has a diameter
of 5 mm, a backbone arc length (`) of 15 mm and a
rigid link length (l
t
) of 8 mm. Further, for all tension
wires, the distance between the backbone and the tension
wire (d
b
) equals 1:85 mm. The articulating tip of the RADS
is actuated using two pairs of tension wires which provide
tip movement in two DOF. Each pair of tension wires is
antagonistically-conﬁgured (inset of Fig. 5) and controlled
by a pulley with radius (r
p
= 9:3 mm) which is driven by
an ECMax22 motor with a GP32/22 gearhead (Maxon Motor,
Sachseln, Switzerland). The complete system is mounted
on a LX30 translational stage (Misumi Group Inc., Tokyo,
Japan) which can be translated along the longitudinal axis
of the delivery sheath. All motors are controlled in position
by an Elmo Whistle 2:5=60 motor controller (Elmo Motion
Control Ltd, Petach-Tikva, Israel). The tip of the RADS is
inserted though a sealed plug into a container ﬁlled with
water which is used to visualize the device using ultrasound
images. In order to provided feedback of the articulating
tip as described in Section II-B, ultrasound images are
obtained by an 18 MHz transducer (18L6) on a Siemens
Acuson S2000
TM
ultrasound system (Siemens AG, Erlangen,
Germany). We position the ultrasound transducer over the
articulating tip of the RADS, while we acquire images with a

frequency of 16 MHz, a power level of 4 dB and a scanning
depth of 4 cm. This results in an effective in-plane resolution
of approximately 0:12 mm per pixel. The S-video output
of the ultrasound machine is used to transfer the images to
a computer (2:80 GHz Intel
R 
I7, 8-GB internal memory
and 64-bit Windows 7) with a frame rate of 25 frames per
second. Compensation for out-of-image-plane motion of the
articulating tip is provided by positioning the RADS along
the longitudinal axis.
B. Experimental Plan
A series of experiments have been conducted in order
to evaluate the performance of the integrated system. The
RADS was controlled along various paths under closed-loop
control using ultrasound images. We evaluate closed-loop
control of the articulating tip of the RADS during tracking of
circular, square and ﬁgure-eight paths (Fig. 6). The circle has
a radius of 6 mm, while the sides of the square are 8 mm and
the amplitudes of the ﬁgure-eight are 5 mm along thex- and
y-axes. All trajectories were evaluated using an articulating
tip velocity of 2:0 mm/s.
C. Experimental Results
The results of the experiments described in the experimen-
tal plan are reported in Table I, while a single representative
of each experiment can be found in Fig. 6. The experiments
were repeated ﬁve times in order to evaluate the tracking
performance of the RADS. Experiments show mean posi-
tioning errors of 1:90 mm and 2:28 mm along thex- andy-
axes, respectively, while the RANSAC algorithm completes
on average 599 iterations (single CPU core implementation).
In the circular path experiments we observe a shape
slightly bigger than the reference path. Similar results are
also observed in the square and ﬁgure-eight paths. This could
be the result of measurement delay in the closed-loop control
system. We use a capturing device to obtain 2D ultrasound
images from the ultrasound system, which could potentially
introduce a delay in the closed-loop controller. Further,
we observe several peaks, especially when the motion of
a tendon pair changes sign. This could be explained by
mechanical hysteresis in the RADS or its actuators. However,
it can not be ruled out that some of these effects could be
due to tendon elongation or crosstalk between the two tendon
pairs (i.e., displacement in one tendon pair inﬂuences the
other tendon pair).
IV. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
This preliminary study presents a novel approach in which
the RADS is used to potentially manipulate existing catheters
in TA-TA VI-related procedures in order to facilitate valve
positioning. A model is derived to describe the RADS shape
and articulating tip position, which is integrated in a model-
based control architecture. We developed a 2D ultrasound
tracking method to evaluate the position of the RADS in ul-
trasound images. This results in an integrated system capable
of controlling the articulating tip of the RADS in closed-
loop manner by using ultrasound images and an EKF. We
experimentally evaluate the closed-loop control performance
of the RADS. Experiments show mean positioning errors of
approximately 2 mm along the x- and y-axes.
In future work, we intend to address the problems in-
troduced by delay and hysteresis. Performance can be im-
proved by reducing the delay in the system, and providing
compensation for mechanical hysteresis. Further, predictive
control can provide a solution to delay, especially during
tracking of motions that are fast and periodic such as beating

heart and respiratory motions. We also intend to integrate 3D
ultrasound in our system in which both tissue and instrument
motions are tracked. Additionally, optical shape sensing and
electromagnetic tracking sensors can be beneﬁcial to provide
instrument information. Further, we plan to include a realistic
circulatory cardiac environment in our setup which uses
a heart pump and a biological aortic valve. Nonetheless,
our current system demonstrates that the RADS can be
controlled under ultrasound image-guidance by a model-
based closed-loop control architecture. This could potentially
enable manipulation of existing catheters in order to provide
accurate valve positioning.
