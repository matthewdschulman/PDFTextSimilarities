Harmonic PZT Poly-Actuators
James Torres, Lluis Penalver-Aguila, and H. Harry Asada, Member, IEEE
Abstract— Capacitive actuators, such as piezoelectric stack
actuators, provide an efﬁcient solution for robotic and mecha-
tronic systems that typically require large forces and minimal
velocities over long periods of time. To overcome the stack
actuator’s limitations, particularly their limited stroke, a har-
monic poly-actuator design is presented. This design utilizes a
multitude of intermediate buckling ampliﬁcation mechanisms
in a parallel arrangement to create a large stroke, high force
actuator. The redundant system architecture combined with
a particular spatial and temporal coordination allow for a
number of salient features, including robustness to failure,
backdrivability, and continuous force control via elementary
ON-OFF control. A prototype was built using six intermediate
buckling ampliﬁcation mechanisms and was able to produce
over 100 Newtons of force over a stroke of 450 mm.
I. INTRODUCTION
Piezoelectric stack actuators, such as lead-zirconate-
titanate (PZT), have several desirable properties for robotic
and mechatronic systems including: a high bandwidth above
100 kHz, power density over 10
8 W
=
m
3, and efﬁciencies
greater than 90% [1]. Furthermore, PZT stacks have two
other major beneﬁts: ﬁrst, they are capacitive actuators and
therefore, are highly efﬁcient in maintaining large forces at a
constant position. Second, they are backdrivable, which can
be essential for safe robotic systems. The major practical
limitation is their limited strain, typically around 0.1%, that
prevent PZT stacks from directly driving robotic systems.
In order to compensate for the limited stroke of the PZT
stack, mechanical ampliﬁcation devices have been developed
to greatly increase the effective displacement. Most of these
devices rely on aligning the PZT stacks at a shallow angle
with respect to each other and connecting them via rotational
joints comprised of ﬂexures. Typically their displacement
ampliﬁcation gain is 10 or less [2][3]. In order to achieve
larger ampliﬁcation, these designs can be arranged in a
nested architecture [4]. This paper will focus on a unit that
is able to produce ampliﬁcation gain of 100 or greater within
a single stage, as discussed in detail here [5].
For a system requiring position control via feedback, these
ampliﬁed mechanisms can be sufﬁcient, but at most only
produce displacements an order of magnitude less than their
length scale. In contrast, linear actuators, such as solenoids
to hydraulics, produce a stroke on the order of the length
scale of the actuator itself. Furthermore, regardless of the

ampliﬁcation mechanism, PZT actuators in general produce
a force output that is a function of the displacement, which
individually limits its force control capabilities.
Long-stroke linear or inﬁnite stroke rotary piezoelectric
actuators have been developed. The most prevalent type are
ultrasonic motors (USM). These motors utilize a cyclic, high
frequency input to produce continuous motion. However,
due to their reliance on friction, their power density is
signiﬁcantly lowered, around 10
4 W
=
m
3 [2]. The lack of
effective means to match impedance between the PZT stack
and the load is another factor for the low power density.
Beyond USM, there are many ways of converting cyclic
motion into continuous output. This paper considers a design
where cyclic motion is produce by the ampliﬁcation unit
as opposed to the piezoelectric actuator directly. Due to
the larger displacement and proportionally lower force, it
becomes mechanically feasible to convert the unit’s cyclic
motion into a long-stroke displacement output by acting on a
sloped surface similar to a gear, instead of relying on friction.
This can be more efﬁcient than USM and the particular
geometry of the surface provides the ability to effectively
interface the output mechanism to the load.
The mechanism described above can be extended to one in
which multiple PZT units are engaged with the output gear
teeth so that a larger force can be generated collectively by
the arrayed PZT units. We refer to this arrangement as a poly-
actuator. Generally, a poly-actuator combines several simple
units in series, parallel or both. Poly-actuators provide several
salient features over a single actuator, including simpliﬁed
individual control, for example ON-OFF control can often
times be sufﬁcient, reduction of hysteresis [6], and robustness
to failures [7].
This paper will discuss the design concept of a particular
poly-actuator using the ampliﬁed PZT units arranged along
the output rod. See Fig. 1. Note that the PZT units comprise
of ampliﬁcation mechanisms that produce a displacement
large enough to transverse the depth of the gear teeth
[5][8]. Analysis of the force characteristics with regard to
position and input voltage are discussed. A simpliﬁed ON-
OFF controller is considered. The initial implementation of a
functional prototype is shown along with experimental results
of the output force properties.
II. DESIGN CONCEPT OF HARMONIC PZT
POLY-ACTUATORS
The harmonic PZT poly-actuator relies on several identical
ampliﬁcation units all acting in parallel on a single output.
Figure 2 shows the schematic of a buckling displacement
ampliﬁcation mechanism [5][8] used for the poly-actuator.

Note the size of the gear teeth that allows the unit’s cyclic motion to be
converted into a long-stroke displacement output without relying on friction.
When a voltage is applied to the PZT stacks, they expand,
with displacement z, from the initial kinematically singular
position in the center and rotate by angle  about the
grounded rotational joints creating a vertical displacement,
y, at the output node. This mechanism is able to produce
a displacement ampliﬁcation of two orders of magnitude
within a single stage due to the immense instantaneous
gain near the kinematic singularity as well as the ability to
displace both upwards and downwards in bi-polar motion.
This buckling ampliﬁcation mechanism becomes the basic
unit within the poly-actuator, shown in Fig. 3. The vertical
arrows demonstrate the displacement direction of the individ-
ual units, whereas the horizontal arrow shows the direction of
the poly-actuator output. These units are equally spread along
one-half of the wavelength of the output waveform. Note
that they are spread over one-half the wavelength due to the
symmetric bi-polar stroke of the buckling unit. For a given
input, there is no difference with regards to the poly-actuator
output between the ﬁrst and second half of the waveform.
The amplitude, A, of the waveform is equal to the free
displacement of the buckling unit in the vertical direction,y.
For this particular poly-actuator, the waveform is a sinusoid,
with a spatial frequency, !, that is proportional to the poly-
actuator output velocity and inversely proportional to the
poly-actuator output force. The location of the individual
units is indicated by the gear phase,', which relates directly

to the gear position, X, as shown in the ﬁgure.
The objective of this paper is to exploit salient features
of poly-actuators consisting of multiple PZT units. A critical
condition for exploiting these features is the equal spacing
of the units along the half wavelength. This provides two
important features: ﬁrst, it ensures there is never a point
where all of the units are in a kinematically singular conﬁg-
uration, and second, it balances each of the units to regulate
the total force generated by the multiple PZT units despite
the displacement-dependent output force of individual units
and their pronounced nonlinearity.
Within one full wavelength of the gear there are four
points where each unit is in a kinematic singularity, the two
peaks and the two center points. The peaks are a kinematic
singularity because the slope of the gear is zero and therefore,
the buckling unit cannot impose a force on the output. The
center points are kinematic singularities because the buckling
mechanism is in its kinematic singular conﬁguration, as
shown in Fig. 2, where the unit cannot impose a force on
the output node. If the units are equally spread along a half
wavelength, the maximum number of units that can be at a
kinematic singularity is two, regardless of the total number of
units. As will be proven later, this then imposes a constraint
that the minimum number of actuators to ensure the poly-
actuator itself is never in a kinematic singularity is three.
As mentioned earlier, the stroke of the ampliﬁcation
mechanism is limited to the inherent stiffness of the PZT
stack. We will show that through the proper placement of the
buckling units the adverse effect of the PZT stack stiffness
disappears and the output force becomes solely reliant on
the input command and the gear phase, '. Similarly, this is
proven in the next section.
Both of these properties are directly related to the sinu-
soidal waveform of the gear, and therefore yield the name
“harmonic” PZT poly-actuator.
III. KINEMATIC AND STATIC ANALYSIS

can be controlled via a variety of algorithms to achieve
multiple salient properties in the poly-actuator, however,
in this paper we will only explore ON-OFF control. The
resultant output force of the poly-actuator depends on:
a) the force-displacement characteristics of each PZT stack,
b) the buckling ampliﬁcation mechanism geometry,
c) the shape of the output shaft, and
d) the number and spatial distribution of the PZT units.

NoteC is a dimensionless gain associated with the geom-
etry of the ampliﬁcation unit and output gear. Furthermore, if
A is equal to the free displacement of the buckling actuator,
the force,f
o
, is to half the blocking force of the PZT which
essentially provides a bias that ensures the output force is
bidirectional.
d) The above expression only represents the gear output
force from a single buckling unit. The poly-actuator has
several units acting simultaneously. Furthermore, as men-
tioned previously, they are evenly distributed over one-half
wavelength. The relative phase position, '
o
i
a constant, is
deﬁned below. The total poly-actuator output force, shown
in Eq. 8, can be expressed as a summation of each of the
contributions form the individual units, where the subscript
i denotes the i-th unit out of n total units. Separating the
global gear position ' from the individual unit positions '
i
yields Eq. 9.
Note that the last four summations are all constants
determined by the distribution of the units. The interaction
between multiple units leads to the cancellation of every
term except those directly affected by the control efforts,u
i
,
provided the number and distribution of actuators is properly
balanced. The four constant summations are identically zero
if '
o
i
is deﬁned as above in Eq. 8 and n > 2. A proof of
this phenomenon can be found in Appendix I. Therefore, the

IV. OUTPUT FORCE CONTROL
For the purposes of this paper, we will consider solely
ON-OFF control, i.e. inputs of u
i
= 0 or u
i
= 1. For a
large number of PZT units, n  1, the simple ON-OFF
controls can generate an output force that varies almost
continuously. For a smaller number of units, the output
force resolution is inevitably limited. However, this anal-
ysis can still provide insight into its general functionality.
Furthermore, this method of powering the PZT stacks is
more efﬁcient as providing a continuous voltage via a linear
ampliﬁer consumes a signiﬁcant amount of power regardless
of the loading condition. Previous research has improved
efﬁciencies even further by utilizing capacitors [9] or other
PZT stacks [10] to store electrical energy not transmitted to
the mechanical load.
A. Backdrivability
The ability to drive the actuator from the output, “back-
drivability”, can be a particularly desirable property for
robotic applications. Consider the situation where all of the
buckling units are held at the same input force, ^ u. The total
gear output force becomes:
F
X
=C
n
X
i=1
^ u sin'
i
= 0 (11)
Similar to the case in Eq. 10, the summation is identically
equal to zero if the inputs are identical. Therefore, the output
force is equal to zero for all positions. It is more efﬁcient to
hold all of the inputs at zero as opposed to a non-zero value to
prevent power from being wasted if the gear is moved. This
is one example where, due to redundancy, there are multiple
inputs that provide the same poly-actuator output force, but
clearly there are signiﬁcant advantages when considering
metrics beyond solely the output force.
B. Average Output Force Control
To achieve a non-zero output force while constrained to
only ON-OFF control of the individual units, there are two
control variables: the charging phase,'
c
, and the discharging
phase, '
d
, shown in Fig. 7. In this situation, each unit
determines its individual phase, '
i
and is held ON or OFF
based on its position relative to the charging and discharging
phases.
Unlike the backdrivable case, the instantaneous poly-
actuator output force,F
X
, varies with the phase position,'.

The buckling units were constrained using carbon ﬁber
reinforced plastic to save weight while maintaining a high
stiffness which is necessary to transmit a large percentage of
the energy through the PZT stacks. [5] However, the frames
had a measurable variation in stiffness due to manufacturing
defects that caused a signiﬁcant degradation in the overall
performance of the poly-actuator.
A comparison was made between the model and the
measured force-gear phase relationship (F
X
versus ') for
the maximum poly-actuator output force control, i.e.'
c
= 0
and '
d
=, shown in Fig. 10.
There is a large discrepancy, approximately a factor of 2,
difference between the model and the measurement. This is
largely due to the fact that the force output characteristics
of the poly-actuator rely heavily on having the individual
units balanced. This requires three major parameters to be
accurate: a) the relative phase position, '
o
i
, b) the preload
force, f
pre
, and c) the stiffness of the PZT stack, k. Based
on machining tolerances and measurements of the individual
units, respectively, we conﬁrmed that the ﬁrst two parameters
were accurate to within 5%. However, the modeled stiffness
of the PZT stack varied signiﬁcantly from unit to unit by over

20%. The physical stiffness of the individual PZT stacks have
a much higher manufacturing repeatability, but the initial
model in Fig. 4 is a lumped parameter model whose stiffness
takes into account the frame and crucial components of the
buckling mechanism.
The unbalanced units prevented the pure backdrivability
as well. Instead of having no output force for all positions
and a constant input, the force ripple was approximately 20
N, just under 10% of the theoretical maximum poly-actuator
output force. The performance was consistent, however, with
Eq. 9, when considering unbalanced parameters.
VI. CONCLUSIONS
A harmonic PZT poly-actuator was shown to collec-
tively use the redundant PZT units with a speciﬁc spatial
distribution of units along the output shaft to produce a
continuous range of average output forces over a large-stroke.
The proper placement of the, ideally, identical individual
units allows for them to balance their inherent stiffness to
provide an output force that relies solely on the input. This
allowed for the poly-actuator to be backdrivable, i.e. zero
output force for all positions, if all of the inputs are equal.
Furthermore, the redundancy allowed for a set of inputs to
impose the same average poly-actuator output force. There-
fore, additional metrics, such as force ripple, peak force, or
total time the units are ON, could be considered as well.
In implementation, however, the units varied signiﬁcantly
enough that the measured output was approximately half
of the modeled poly-actuator output force. Providing more
consistent, repeatable units will improve the output char-
acteristics. Furthermore, expanding the control algorithms
beyond ON-OFF will allow for possible compensation of
the discrepancies between units.
