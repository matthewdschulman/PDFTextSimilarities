Abstract— Increasing efﬁciency by improving the locomotion
methods is a key issue for underwater robots. Hence, an
accurate dynamic model is important for both controller design
and efﬁcient locomotion methods. This paper presents a model
of the kinematics and dynamics of a planar, underwater snake
robot aimed at control design. Fluid contact forces and torques
are modeled using analytical ﬂuid dynamics. The model is
derived in a closed form and can be utilized in modern
model-based control schemes. The proposed model is easily
implemented and simulated, regardless of the number of robot
links. Simulation results with a ten link robotic system are
presented.
I. INTRODUCTION
For centuries, engineers and scientists have gained inspi-
ration from the natural world while searching for ideal solu-
tions to technical problems. More recently, this process has
been termed as biomimetics. Snake robots have been studied
due to their ability to move in challenging environments,
where other types of robots usually fail [1]. Empirical and
analytical studies of snake locomotion were reported by Gray
[2]. Among the ﬁrst attempts to develop a snake prototype,
the work of Hirose [3] is essential. The high number of
DOFs of snake robots makes them difﬁcult to control, but
gives them the ability to traverse irregular environments,
surpassing the mobility of conventional wheeled, tracked or
legged robots [1].
Mobile robots continue to challenge researchers with new
applications in a variety of environments [1]. The most recent
ﬁelds of interest include the integration of robotic technology
into underwater exploration, monitoring, and surveillance.
Comparing amphibious snake robots to the traditional snake
robots, the former ones have the advantage of adaptability
to aquatic environments. The research on amphibious snake
robots (also referred to as lamprey robots or eel-like robots)
is, however, much less extensive, and fewer prototypes have
been developed [4], [5], [6].
Increasing efﬁciency by improving the locomotion meth-
ods is a key issue for underwater robots. Increased agility
and maneuverability are connected to a general decrease in

the size of the robot, as well as more ﬂexibility in its internal
shape. In order to improve these properties, researchers
begun studying aquatic biological systems and their methods
of locomotion [7], [8], [9], [10].
There exist many underwater robots, and these can be
classiﬁed into autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs),
remotely-operated underwater vehicles (ROVs), and bottom-
crawling-legged underwater robots. More recently, there has
been growing interest in the design, modeling and control of
underwater robots that propel themselves and maneuver by
mimicking the movement of a ﬁsh. A number of researchers
have developed analytical models for the forces generated
during the motion of these devices in the water [8].
The dynamics of snake robots moving on land have been
derived by utilizing various modeling techniques [1]. The
friction between the snake robot and the ground signiﬁcantly
affects its motion. In addition to many models of snake robots
that consider sideslip constraints, there have been reported
cases with anisotropic ground friction properties similar to
biological snakes, providing the opportunity to model lateral
undulation locomotion patterns. In [1], the authors provide
an overview on modeling and analysis of snake robot loco-
motion emphasizing the growing trend toward locomotion in
unknown and challenging environments. When it comes to
swimming snake robots, only a few modeling approaches
have been presented for eel-like robots [11], [12], [13].
Generally, studies of hyper-redundant mechanisms (HRMs),
also known as snake robots, have focused on land based
studies. An emerging ﬁeld of study considers such multi-link
systems suited for aquatic propulsion as well, and several
prototypes of multi-link swimmers have been developed [5],
[6], [11].
Two fundamental works in the ﬁeld, of Taylor [9] and
Lighthill [14], provide analytical models of ﬂuid forces
acting on the body during undulatory swimming. However,
their analytical methods require a number of major simpli-
fying assumptions. McIsaac and Ostrowski [11] presented
a dynamic model of anguilliform swimming for eel-like
robots and Boyer et al. [12] present the dynamic modeling
of a continuous three-dimensional swimming eel-like robot.
However, the majority of swimming robots modeling omit
ﬂuid moments which are supposed to have a negligible effect
on the overall motion of the system [11], [15]. It should be
noted that ﬂuid moments are directly related to the power
consumption of the system (see e.g. [13]) and thus, they are
neglected in these modeling approaches in order to simplify
the hydrodynamic effects. It is also worth noting that, in [13],
[12] and [16] ﬂuid moments are modeled, but the drag force
and moment are integrated numerically at each sample time

of the algorithm and evaluated numerically, which results in
the lack of a closed form solution. [17] presents the modeling
of the reactive force and moment acting on an elongated
body, moving in a weakly non-uniform potential ﬂow. This
model has been used to investigate the passive and the active
swimming of a ﬁsh in a vortex street, while no viscous effects
have been taken into account. In [18], a solution to the fast
dynamics of eel-like robots has been proposed and tested
in comparison with a Navier-Stokes solver. Furthermore, a
number of research groups are currently working to develop
accurate low-cost swimming models required for such prob-
lems [13].
In this paper we present a solution to the modeling
problem that results in a closed form solution, avoiding the
numerical evaluation of drag effects. In addition, it takes
into account the current effect, using an analytical simpliﬁed
form. For control design purposes, it is a main advantage
that this hydrodynamic modeling concludes in a closed form,
without the need of an algorithmic way to compute the drag
force and torque and thus it is well suited for model-based
control design of underwater snake robots locomotion. It
is well known that the hydrodynamic forces (ﬂuid forces)
induced by the motion of a rigid body in an underwater envi-
ronment are very complex and highly nonlinear and therefore
several of these effects are often not taken into account when
modeling the system. In this modeling approach, however,
both the linear and the nonlinear drag forces (resistive ﬂuid
forces), the added mass effect (reactive ﬂuid forces), the ﬂuid
moments and current effect are considered.
To the authors’ best knowledge, this modeling approach is
the ﬁrst modeling approach that takes into account both the
current effect and the combination of linear and nonlinear
drag effect. It is important to notice that the ground snake
robot model [19] falls out as a special case of the developed
snake robot model, by replacing the ﬂuid friction model with
the ground friction model and setting the ﬂuid parameters
to zero. The presented model is thus an extension of the
land based snake robot model [19], and comprise snake
robots moving both on land and in water. In addition to
providing completeness, this also makes the model applicable
for uniﬁed control methods for amphibious snake robots
moving both on land and in water.
This paper is organized as follows. Section II presents a
2D model of an underwater snake robot’s kinematics and
dynamics, explaining in detail the hydrodynamic effects,
followed by simulations validations, for both serpentine and
eel-like motions, in Section III. Conclusions and suggestions
for future research are presented in Section IV .
II. MODELING OF UNDERWATER SNAKE ROBOTS
This section presents a continuous model of an underwater
snake robot moving in the horizontal plane, i.e. moving at a
constant depth. The snake robot is assumed to be neutrally
buoyant, such that its depth stays constant unless active depth
control (using rotation of the links around the body-ﬁxed y-
axis) is utilized. The model is derived for the purpose of
analysis and design of motion control of the position and
heading of the snake robot in this horizontal plane. The
kinematics and dynamics of the robot taking into account
the hydrodynamic effects will be presented.
A. Notations and deﬁned symbols
The snake robot consists of n rigid links of equal length
2l;i= 1;:::;n interconnected by n  1 joints. The links are
assumed to have the same mass m and moment of inertia
J=
1
3
ml
2
. The mass of each link is uniformly distributed so
that the link CM (center of mass) is located at its center point
(at length l from the joint at each side). The total mass of
the snake robot is therefore nm. In the following sections, the
kinematics and dynamics of the underwater snake robot will
be modeled in terms of the mathematical symbols described
in Table I and illustrated in Fig. 1a and Fig. 1b. Vectors are
either expressed in the global coordinate system or in the
local link coordinate system of link i. This is indicated by
superscript global or link,i, respectively. If is not speciﬁed
otherwise, a vector with no superscript is expressed in the
global coordinate system. The following vectors and matrices

The kinematics of an underwater snake robot is similar to that
of a snake robot moving on land. In this section we provide
a brief presentation of the kinematics for completeness. An
extensive presentation of the snake robot kinematics can
be found in [19]. Additionally, it is necessary to derive
the equation of linear accelerations of the links in order to
express the ﬂuid forces in the following section. Hence, the
linear accelerations of the links are found by differentiating
the velocity of the individual links (9) with respect to time
and using the second derivative of Eq. (4), which gives

C. Hydrodynamic modeling
As has been noted in the bio-robotics community, under-
water snake (eel-like) robots bring a promising prospective
for improving the efﬁciency and maneuverability of modern-
day underwater vehicles. However, it should be mentioned
that, for swimming robots, the dynamic modeling of the con-
tact forces is most complicated compared to the modeling of
the overall rigid motion and the dynamics of the body defor-
mation. Hence, the hydrodynamic modeling task presents a
major challenge. In addition, the validity of Taylor’s resistive
[9] and Lighthill’s reactive [14] model assumptions varies
signiﬁcantly depending on the ﬂow regime and geometry of
the swimmer, as it is pointed in [13]. Generally, for slow
swimming devices at low Reynolds numbers, the viscous
forces become dominant. Hence, in this case, the Taylors
resistive model is most applicable. For larger swimmers
in which the added-mass effects dominate, Lighthill argues
that reactive forces are the primary source of thrust and
the resistive ones can be neglected. For, underwater snake
robots, which lie in between these two extremes, both the
resistive forces (drag forces) and reactive ones (added mass
affects) need to be modeled, since both play a critical role in
underwater swimming robotic systems propulsion (see e.g.
[20]).
The force and moment balance equations require that the
ﬂuid terms have to be deﬁned. However, it should be noted
that the hydrodynamic forces (ﬂuid forces) induced by the
motion of a rigid body in an underwater environment are very
complex and highly nonlinear. Consequently, we decided to
solve the hydrodynamic modeling problem using an analyti-
cal simpliﬁed form suited for the design of online control
of underwater snake robots. The Navier-Stokes equations
are very difﬁcult to solve and quite unsuited for robotics
control design purposes. Hence, as far as the ﬂuid effects
are considered, for control design purposes, we need to
model the hydrodynamic phenomena in a sufﬁciently simple
manner while taking into account all the hydrodynamic
effects that are signiﬁcant for the control design.
It is important to notice that modeling for control de-
sign purposes poses different challenges than hydrodynamic
modeling for simulations. In the latter, high accuracy and
modeling of all hydrodynamic effects are important, while
the model does not need to be in a form suited for analytical
analysis. When modeling for model-based control design
purposes, however, the model needs to be well suited for
analytical analysis while only the signiﬁcant hydrodynamic
4542
effects need to be included. The closed-loop control system
provides robustness to the less-signiﬁcant unmodeled hydro-
dynamics, cf. for instance [21] and [22].
The literature provides three simple analytical models suit-
able for control design purposes. All of them are based on the
ﬂuid mechanics theory of slender bodies. The biomechanics
community suggests the ﬁrst one, the second one is offered
by the oceanic engineering community and and the third one
is a model that is mostly used in the robotics community.
In particular,
 the ﬁrst model is a result of the Large Amplitude
Elongated Body Theory (LAEBT) of ﬁsh locomotion
by Lighthill [14],
 the second model is devoted to the dynamics of under-
water ﬂexible cables [12] and
 the third one is based on the Morison’s equations and
models the forces between the ﬂuid and the cylindrical
links of underwater snake robots [23], [24].
The underwater snake robotic system that is the subject of
this paper, swims at a Reynolds number of approximately
10
4
to 10
5
. As already mentioned, the models presented
by Taylor [9] and Lighthill [14] are good candidates to
model the ﬂuid effects for slow swimmers at low Reynolds
number and for fast swimmers at high Reynolds number,
respectively. However, a detailed model of the ﬂuid effects
for Reynolds numbers of approximately 10
4
to 10
5
can only
be achieved through a full numerical solution to the Navier-
Stokes equations [13].
Unfortunately, the prohibitive computational costs of such
methods are not suitable for real time control, and the result-
ing models would neither be suited for analytical analysis.
In the modeling approach presented in this paper, we thus
decide to use the Morison’s equations [23], [24], assuming
that the robot is a slender body. To quantify the ﬂuid forces,
each link of the underwater snake robot is considered as an
isolated segment. Each segment of the robot is approximated
as an elliptical cylinder. The ﬂuid forces are modeled in each
cross section of the links and depends only on the transverse
link’s motion. It is worth nothing that, in this modeling
approach, the ﬂuid effects that induced by the corners of
the joints are neglected. We now present some assumptions
underlying the modeling approach.
Assumption 1. The ﬂuid is viscid, incompressible, and
irrotational in the inertia frame.
Assumption 2. The robot is neutrally buoyant, i.e, we
assume that the mass per unit of volume of the robot is
equal to that of the water, such that gravity and buoyancy
cancel each other out.
Assumption 3. The current in the inertial frame, v
c
=
[V
x;i
;V
y;i
]
T
, is constant and irrotational.
Remark 1. Assumptions 1 and 2 are common assumptions
in hydrodynamic modeling of slender body swimming robots
[12], [13], [25], while Assumption 3 is a reasonable simpli-
ﬁcation of the real-world situation [22],[21].
Remark 2. Neutral buoyancy, ensuring that Assumption 2
is satisﬁed, is achieved by proper ballasting of the snake
robot. The ballast will furthermore be positioned at the
bottom of each snake robot link, in order to prevent it from
rolling, making it self-stabilized in roll.
The ﬂuid forces are functions of the current and it is
shown in hydrodynamics literature, see e.g. [21], that the
force exerted by the current can be characterized by the
current velocity vector. This vector can be added vectorially
to the link speed before calculating the ﬂuid forces. In many
works in ship control, in the presence of ocean currents
the current is assumed to be constant in the body frame,
i.e. it is assumed that ˙ v
c
= 0. This assumption is easily
violated during turning [21], and the current velocity should
thus be assumed constant in the inertial frame, as given in
Assumption 3.
The ﬂuid forces will be expressed as functions of relative
velocity, and thus the relative velocity of link i is deﬁned
as v

As described by [13],[25], each link is subject to a force
from the ﬂuid acting on the CM of the link and also a ﬂuid
torque acting on the CM. In the following, we will derive
the ﬂuid forces and torques acting on the snake robot, using
Morison’s equations [23]. In particular, we will ﬁrst state
the assumption on which the development is based, then
present how the force exerted by the ﬂuid on a cylindrical
object is made up of two components: the virtual mass force
(added mass effect) and the drag force. The drag model that
is employed here is in a form which takes into account the
generalized case of anisotropic friction acting on each link. In
particular, this means that each link has two drag coefﬁcients,
c
t
and c
n
, describing the drag force in the tangential (along
link x axis) and normal (along link y axis) direction of the
link, respectively. The ﬂuid forces exerted on link i by the
ﬂuid can then be expressed as [23], [25]

Furthermore, we make the following assumption:
Assumption 4. The relative velocity at each section of
the link in body-ﬁxed frame (F
B
) is equal to the relative
velocity of the respective center of mass of each link. With
this assumption we avoid the complexity of deriving the drag
forces in analytical form, due to the nonlinear terms.
4543
Remark 3. This approximation is valid in our case because
the link’s length is small compared to the total robot’s length,
which means that the velocities will not vary much from
one section to the other. Furthermore, Assumption 4 let us
avoid the numerical calculation of the drag forces due to the
nonlinear terms.
Due to Assumption 4 it is not necessary to evaluate
numerically the drag force and use an algorithmic approach
of modeling, and thus we are able to derive a compact
and closed form model of the underwater swimming robotic
system.
We will now derive the matrices
ˆ
C
D
and
ˆ
C
A
. For the
cylindrical links with major diameter 2a and minor diameter
2b and taking into account that the length of each link is 2l,
we can express

where C
f
and C
D
are the drag coefﬁcients in x and y direction
of motion, while C
A
denotes the added mass coefﬁcient [5],
[26] and r is the density of the ﬂuid. The added mass
parameter in the x direction is considered equal to zero
(m
t
= 0), because the added mass of a slender body in
longitudinal direction can be neglected compared to the body
mass [26].
After modeling the ﬂuid forces acting on the snake robot,
we will now model the ﬂuid moment t
i
. Many previous
studies of underwater swimming robots neglect ﬂuid torques,
since it is assumed that they have little effect on the overall
motion of the robot [11], [15]. In [13] a ﬁnite segment
approach is employed in order to take into account the ﬂuid
moments, however, in this modeling approach the drag mo-
ment is evaluated numerically. Additionally, in [12] and [16]
the ﬂuid moments are taken into account but concluded in
an algorithmic approach of computing the drag moment. We
decide to include the ﬂuid moments in the model because,
ﬁrst of all, this implies a more accurate modeling approach
from a hydrodynamic perspective and, secondly, due to the
fact that the ﬂuid moments are directly related to the power
consumption of the system. Since the ﬂuid torques contribute
signiﬁcantly to the required actuation torques at the joints
[13] and as the research on underwater swimming robots are
expanding, there is increased demand for improved efﬁciency
to allow for longer missions to be undertaken.
The ﬂuid torque is a result of the link rotation only and
thus the ﬂuid torque on the CM of link i is a result of
ﬂuid forces acting normal to the link during link rotation.
This approach is based on the common approach for a plate
undergoing forced angular oscillation [27]. Each link of
the robot is oscillating similarly to a ﬂat plates oscillating
in rotational motion. In [27] it is shown that under this
assumption, the torque applied on link i by the ﬂuid can
be modeled through the relation

where the l

and l

parameters depend on the shape of
the body and the ﬂuid characteristics. It is worth mentioning
that [27] shows that the parameter l
2
can be set to zero,
neglecting the torques due to the linear drag forces. Nev-
ertheless, in our modeling approach we decide to consider,
for completeness, the ﬂuid torques due to the linear drag
forces, since, these torques are dominant for slow swimming
velocities.
We will now derive the ﬂuid force parameters l
1
, l
2
and
l
3
. It is well-known that, for a cylinder, the added mass
torque reduces to a simple analytical form with the parameter
l

underwater snake robot. The forces and torques acting on

We obtain the acceleration of the CM by differentiating (4)
twice with respect to time, inserting (30), and noting that the
constraint forces h

and h

, are cancelled out when the link
accelerations are summed. This gives

This equation simply states, as would be expected, that the
acceleration of the CM of an underwater snake robot equals
the sum of the external forces acting on the robot divided by
its mass. The torque balance for link i is given by

Remark 4. It is interesting to note that if, in the dynamic
model (32) and (36), we set the ﬂuid parameters to zero
and replace the drag forces in x and y direction with ground
friction models [19], then the model reduces to an identical
dynamic model of a ground snake robot, described in [19].
The underwater snake robot model is thus an extension of
the land snake robot model, and may be used for amphibious
snake robots moving both on land and in water.
III. SIMULATION RESULTS
In this section, simulation results will be presented for
three different modeling approaches: case 1 – Added mass
and nonlinear drag effect, case 2 – Added mass, linear
and nonlinear drag effect and case 3 – Added mass, linear
drag effect, nonlinear drag effect and current effect. In the
following, the mathematical expressions for lateral undula-
tion and eel-like motion are presented. Moreover, we explain
how to choose the ﬂuid parameters. Finally, the simulation
results are presented for both lateral undulation and eel-like
motion. The models were implemented in Matlab R2011b.
The dynamics was calculated using the ode23tb solver with
a relative and absolute error tolerance of 10
 4
.
A. Lateral undulation
The mathematical expression for the snake’s gait in lo-
comotion studies depends on its construction and model.
Lateral undulation [1] is the fastest and most common form
4545
of snake locomotion, where the motion is achieved by cre-
ating continuous body waves that are propagated backwards
from head to tail. In order to achieve lateral undulation, the
snake is commanded to follow the serpenoid curve [3]. The
proposed lateral undulation is realized by controlling each
joint of the snake robot according to the sinusoidal reference
f

i
=a sin(wt+(i  1)b)+g; i= 1;:::;n  1; (41)
where the parameter a corresponds to the amplitude of the
serpentine wave that propagates along the body of the snake
robot, w is the angular frequency of the sinusoidal joint
motion, b determines the phase shift between the sequential
joints, and g is the joint offset that is used to control the
direction of the motion.
B. Eel-like motion
Eel-like motion is achieved by propagating lateral axial
undulations with increasing amplitude from nose to tail [8].
A simple equation is derived for the eel-like motion by
controlling each joint of the snake robot according to the
reference signal
f

i


n  i
n+ 1

sin(wt+(i  1)b)+g; i= 1;:::;n  1; (42)
where the parameter a(n  i)=(n+ 1) corresponds to the
increasing amplitude, from nose to tail, of the wave that prop-
agates along the body of the snake robot, w is the angular
frequency of the sinusoidal joint motion, b determines the
phase shift between the joints, and g is the joint offset.
C. Low-level joint control
A standard PD-controller is used to calculate the joints’
actuator torques from the joints’ reference angles according
to
u
i
= K
p;i
(f

i
 f

)  K

˙
f
i
; i= 1;:::;n  1; (43)
where K
p;i
> 0 and K
d;i
> 0 are the gains of the controller. A
velocity reference is not included in (43) since the purpose
of the derivative part is simply to damp the joint motion,
if the joint velocities become large. The advantage of this
controller is that it does not require calculation of the
derivative of f

i
with respect to time, while its disadvantage
is that it is unable to track time-varying joint reference angles
perfectly.
D. Fluid parameters
As already mentioned, in our modeling approach, we
decide to use Morison’s equation assuming that each link of
the robot is an elliptical cylinder. Hence, it is important to
investigate the inﬂuence of the current effects on cylindrical
objects. Even though the force coefﬁcients vary very much
in the presence of current, Sarpkaya and Storm [28] found a
modiﬁed Morison equation to represent the measured force
in a coexisting ﬂow ﬁeld as well as the original equation in
a no-current ﬁeld.
It must be noted that, ideally, the drag and added mass co-
efﬁcients of the system should be determined experimentally.
This information is not available and the coefﬁcients will be
chosen under the assumption of a steady-state ﬂow [20], [16].
The added mass coefﬁcients are simply set to their theoretical
values, C
A
= 1 and C
M
= 1 [13]. In [29], Guskova et al.
investigate the C
D
and C
A
of laterally oscillating elliptical
cylinders under conditions dimensionally equivalent to those
of our underwater snake robot. The parameter C
D
is found to
vary from approximately 2 to 3 and C
A
varies between 0.93
and 1. In [29], it is mentioned that the lateral coefﬁcients
of the simulated robot may not deviate signiﬁcantly from
their steady-state values. In our simulations, we decide to
apply the steady-state coefﬁcients. The axial viscous force’s
coefﬁcient is selected as C
f
= 0:03 from a review of exper-
imental data presented in [30]. In addition, for a cylindrical
obstacle immerged in a ﬂow with a Reynolds number of
approximately R
e
' 10
5
, the ﬂuid parameters can be set as
C
D
= 1, C
A
= 1, C
f
= 0:01, C
M
= 1 [16].
E. Simulation parameters
A snake robot was considered with n = 10 links, each
one having length 2l = 2 0:14 m. The mass of each link
is m = 0:6597 kg and is chosen so to fulﬁl the neutrally
buoyant assumption. The initial values of the states of the
snake robot were set to zero, i.e. the snake robot is initially
at rest at the origin, with its heading along the inertial x axis.
The hydrodynamic related parameters for the elliptic section
with half small and great axis’ length 0.03 m and 0.05 m,
respectively, r = 1000 kg/m
3

f

. It should be noted that the anisotropic
friction property is achieved by a low drag coefﬁcient in the
tangential direction and a higher one in the perpendicular.
The values of a constant current in inertial frame are set
to [0:1;0:1] m/sec. In this simulation a joint PD-controller
(43) is used with parameters K

F . Lateral undulation: simulation results
In this section, we let the snake robot move by the motion
pattern of lateral undulation (41). We include this motion
pattern since it is commonly used for ground snake robots,
and we therefore, want to show how this (forward) motion is
obtained by an underwater snake robot. Simulation results for
lateral undulation of the underwater snake robot is presented
for the three different cases. In particular, the motion of
the center of mass is presented in Fig. 3a and the forward
velocity (5) is presented in Fig. 3b. It should be noted that
the robot is is moving in a straight line in case 3, although
the presence of current.
G. Eel-like motion: simulation results
In this section, we present and compare the simulation
results for the eel-like motion pattern for the three different
cases. In particular, the motion of the center of mass is
presented in Fig. 4a and the forward velocity is presented
in Fig. 4b. In contrast to the lateral undulation, the robot
is moving almost in a straight line in case 3, although the

IV. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
This paper has presented a model of the kinematics and
dynamics of a planar, underwater snake robot. The model
is in closed-loop form and is thus particularly well suited
for modern model-based control design schemes. As it is
mentioned before, the ﬂuid forces induced by the motion of
a rigid body in an underwater environment are very complex
and highly nonlinear and therefore several of these effects are
often not taken into account when modeling the system. In
this modeling approach, however, the combination of linear
and the nonlinear drag forces, the added mass effect, the
ﬂuid moments and current effect are considered. Simulation
results for the serpentine motion pattern for lateral undulation
and eel-like motion are presented. In future work, the authors
will employ the proposed model in order to develop and
analyze controllers for underwater snake robot. In addition,
an extension of the modeling in any 2D plane of 3D will be
investigated in order to provide the ability to use it for depth
control purposes in the future.
