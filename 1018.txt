Abstract—For humanoid robots to perform whole-body
motions, a motion planner should generate feasible motions
satisfying various constraints including joint torque limitation,
friction, balancing, collision, and so on. Furthermore, for life-
size humanoid robots to perform higher-load motions, such as
climbing ladders, safely, it is important to generate motions
which requirements are not too close to the limitations. In
this paper, we propose a humanoid motion planner based on
Body Retention Load Vector (BRLV), which is a novel index for
representing severity of physical constraints: limitation of joint
Torque, contact Force, and contact Moment (TFM limitations).
By minimizing the norm of BRLV, we obtain humanoid motions
that are farthest from TFM limitations. Finally, we evaluate
the proposed motion planner in simulation and conﬁrm the
effectiveness of the planner through experiments in which a
life-size humanoid robot climbs a ladder and a car
I. INTRODUCTION
To generate whole-body motions with some complex
contact state’s transitions is a very important problem for
humanoid robots: for example, climbing ladders and getting
into cars (Fig.1). However, humanoid motions involving
contacts have a lot of constraints. For maintaining grasp,
the humanoid’s hand must keep it’s position and orientation.
For balancing, contact force and moment must be within
an appropriate range. Thus, previous research on while-
body motion generation have formulated this problem as an
optimization or search problem with some constraints [1, 2,
3, 4, 5].
However, most studies focusing on hard motions such as
climbing ladder only evaluated their methods in simulation
and did not provide any implementation on humanoid robots.
Through a lot of trial-and-error in climbing experiments with
a real life-sized humanoid robot, HRP-2 [6], we arrived at
the conclusion that severity of physical constraints due to
heaviness of a real humanoid robot and sensitiveness of
modeling error on physical contact condition and constraints
are the main problems. Compared to small robots [7, 8],
humanoid robots are very heavy. Compared to multi-leg
robots [9, 10], humanoid hands are powerless and their feet
have no ability to grasp.
In this paper, we propose a novel method for generating
whole-body motions, especially for enabling steep climbing
motion such as climbing step/vertical ladders. Our method

not only satisﬁes all constraints but also minimizes the sever-
ity of physical constraints: limitations of joint Torque, contact
Force, contact Moment (TFM limitations). To minimize the
severity, we introduce a new index, Body Retention Load
Vector (BRLV), and minimize it during an optimization pro-
cess involving robot states and a selection process involving
contact states.
Compared to previous research studies, contributions of
this paper are as follows:
Harada et al. [1] solved the optimization problem with
some constraints to generate natural trajectory and posture.
The cost functions involved torque, acceleration, and angular
momentum. Although this approach is very generic, contact
force and moment are also important values to preventing
accidents such as slipping and falling. In addition, to con-
sider the physical severity of robots, these values should be
normalized with their constraints.
Bouyarmane et al. [3] achieved contact state transitions
with dynamic motions using one of the hill-climbing meth-
ods. This approach is very fast and adaptive, but, for high-
load climbing motions, it may generate some awkward
trajectories because there will be physical potential hill on
the way of contact states transition. So, our approach is to
generate static key poses in climbing and connecting them

with polynomial functions.
Hauser et al. [2] selected contact states using a sampling-
based approach and was able to generate a variety of mo-
tions in some uneven terrains. In contrast, we use greedy
algorithm. We have two reasons for this; One reason is that
greedy algorithm is easy to use with evaluation functions.
Our goal is to generate safe motions minimizing BRLV.
Another reason is that complex contact states transitions in
real world needs a lot of re-computations of next contact
states. For example, impact in landing on ladders may change
the contact state in comparison with planned one. Then, we
will have to compute again the next contact state from current
state.

To make up for the lack of power and safety, we focus on

In steep climbing, TFM limitations are very severe, and if
this limitation is not satisﬁed, dangerous accident will occur.
To evaluate the severity of TFM limitations, we introduce a
new index, Body Retention Load Vector (BRLV):

BRLV contains contact force (f

), contact moment (n

),
and torque of joints from the contact link (?

). All of
them are normalized with TFM limitations Eq.(2),Eq.(3). So,
BRLV of any feasible robot state must satisfy the following
constraints:
?1 ≤ BRLV
i
≤1 (5)
The goal of this paper is to generate safe motions, that is,
motions with minimized BRLV. In the following section, the
algorithm and the result are shown.
B. Overview of steep climbing motion planner
Fig. 2. Overview of steep climbing motion planner
Before explaining about our approach, We will show you
a overview of our planner (Fig.2).
1) Require: Our planner requires target direction, models
of environment, and model of robot. Target direction is a
vector to which robot moves. Models of environment have
an information about feasible set of contact states candidates.
In this paper, we call contact state as a set of two kinds of
constraints. A) Geometrical constraints: contact position and
orientation. B) TFM limitations.
1776
2) Output: Our planner outputs robot states sequence.
Robot state is a set of contact states, joint angles, base link’s
position and orientation, and contact force and moment.
3) Procedure: Our planner makes up of 3 components:
- The ﬁrst one is key pose generator (Section.III), which
generates a set of static key robot states from the feasi-
ble set of contact states. All robot states will satisfy not
only geometrical constraints (contact position, contact
orientation, and no collision between the other models),
but also TFM limitations.
- Second one is the key pose connector (Section.IV),
which connects the static key robot states and generates
trajectories of swing limbs and center of gravity avoid-
ing collision, and determines the time of movement
of the trajectory taking into accout two joint torque
limitations: instantaneous and average torque limits.
- Third one is the planned motion executor (Section.V),
which is the component to control humanoid robot
as planned. The joint angles and contact forces are
controlled.
III. KEY POSE GENERATION WITH MINIMIZING BRLV
Key pose generation involves three components:
- Robot state optimizer:
Optimizes the BRLV norm of static robot state with
given contact states.
- Motion sequencer:
Determines the next target link and contact state using
the following contact state selector, and generates robot
states sequence using robot state optimizer.
- Contact state selector:
Selects contact states of target link from the contact
states candidates in the models of environment.
The following sub-sections, we will explain about each
parts.

In this sub-section, we propose a numerical method to
minimize the BRLV norm of static robot state satisfying
given contact states (Algorithm.1). Our algorithm is an
iterative method. It separates the constraints into physical and
geometrical ones, then solves them and updates the center
of gravity position of the robot to reduce BRLV.

and 14-th one also satisﬁes with more margin.

1) “inverse kinematics”: This function solves the geo-
metrical constraints: contact position, contact orientation,
,position of center of gravity, and avoiding collision. If there
is no solution to the inverse kinematics problem or the
change in c is small enough, the loop terminates.
2) “optimize brlv”: This function optimizes a quadratic
form of BRLV with TFM limitations: Eq.(1), Eq.(2), Eq.(3).
Geometrical values such as ?,x
b
,R
b
are ﬁxed. Because
TFM limitations are composed of linear equations and non-
equations, if the object function can be expressed as a
quadratic form, QP (Quadratic Planning) algorithm such as
goldfarb-idnani method can be applied. BRLV takes on a
non-linear form with respect to force and moment, so, we
use M

is a constant
vector. In the following experiments, we use[0050000]
T
for hands, and[00500000]
T
for legs.
3) “calc cog to reduce brlv”: This function updates the
center of gravity to reduce BRLV using the following equa-

Eq.(6) is obtained by isolating c in Eq.(1). Eq.(6) utilizes
the moment arm of center of gravity and control the contact
force and moment. To use BRLV in Eq.(6) and to reduce
BRLV norm, we transform BRLV as follow:
F
BRLV

E is 6?6 unit matrix, and ? is the gain. By using ?f
BRLV
as ?f in Eq.(6), we can obtain a change in c for reducing
BRLV .
4) Application to balancing on a ladder: We applied
robot state optimizer to the task of balancing on a ladder
with 3 contact links: both hands and right leg.
Fig.3 shows the BRLV norms (left) and BRLV elements
over 1.0 (right) in each iteration. With just 4 iterations, all
the constraints were satisﬁed. All of 14 iterations took 2.7
seconds on Intel Core i7-3520M CPU 2.90GHz. However,
we implements our algorithm using one of the dialects of
lisp interpreter: euslisp [11]. So, we believe that there are a
lot of room for acceleration in computing.
Fig.4 shows the robot states in each iteration. With the
ﬁrst posture, the humanoid robot’s center of gravity is far
from the support leg, but with the last posture, it is near and
has a low-load.
B. Motion sequencer: generates robot states sequence
Fig. 5. Top: Procedure of motion sequencer. Bottom: remove, reach,
suspend robot states with targeting right leg as next contact link.
Motion sequencer generates robot states for achieving
contact states transition. Contact state transition has three
steps as follows:
1) remove
Remove contact of target contact link. And
call robot state optimizer in Section.III-A. If
robot state optimizer returns fail, backtrack with
failure BRLV to the previous reach step.
2) reach
Select the next contact state of target contact link
using contact state selector in Section.III-C. When
calling robot state optimizer with new contact state,
target contact link is not able to exert any force
and moment. If this optimization returns fail, call
contact state selector with failure BRLV again while
optimization fails and there are still contact state
candidates remainings.
3) suspend
Call robot state optimizer with all contact states.
This step always has one answer because the robot
state in reach is also the answer of this step.

Fig. 6. Graphs of all contact link’s BRLVs
We applied this motion sequencer to a ladder climbing
motion. Contact link candidates are both arms and both legs.
Contact state candidates are given manually in reference to
a human motions. The results are shown in Fig.7. All BRLV
elements of contact links (Fig.6) satisfy Eq.(5). Motion
sequencer generates 24 robot states to climb 2 steps, and
it took 52.4 sec with no backtrack.
C. Contact state selector: selects contact state to reduce BRLV
Because contact states determine all constraints without
collision, selection of beneﬁcial contact state for reducing
BRLV is a very important task. We use greedy algorithm to
1778
Fig. 7. Generated climbing key poses
select contact states. And we also use backtrack methods to
reselect contact states and to reduce BRLV in the future. We
propose three simple indices to determine the next contact
state as follows:

are positive gains. a is the indicator for selecting a surface
that can exert the largest force and moment in the direction
of BRLV. b is the indicator for moving toward the target
direction d. c is the indicator to select reachable point. The
contact state which maximizes L is the next contact state.

We applied this contact state selector and motion se-
quencer in Section.III-B to a vertical ladder climbing motion
(Fig.8). To climb up 5 steps, motion sequencer generates 60
robot states in 77.6 sec. We gave 3 contact state candidates
on each foothold, these normal vectors of contact planes are
shown in Fig.9: “a” is vertical, “b” tilts 15 degrees towards
robots, and “c” tilts 15 degrees towards the other side of
“b”. In balancing on a vertical ladder, it is impossible to
place the center of gravity on any contact positions, and robot
needs a lot of moment to balance. At ﬁrst, our contact state
Fig. 9. Balancing on a vertical ladder needs a lot of moment, and tilt
contact states are needed
selector selects “a” because a standing posture needs a lot
of vertical force due to gravity and torque limitations. But,
after backtracking, the selector reselects “b” to cancel out the
moment, and motion sequencer successfully generates these
climbing motions.
We also applied the contact state selector to climbing of
a steeper surface: rock wall climbing. The rock wall we
used was composed of 150 cubes which have random sizes,
positions, and orientations. All faces of these cubes are the
contact state candidates. Our planner successfully generated
160 robot states with 30 back tracks to climb up 1.5 meters,
and the whole computation took 456.0 seconds.

IV. KEY POSE CONNECTION
WITH TWO JOINT TORQUE LIMITATIONS
A. Generation of collision-free trajectories
Fig. 11.
Trajectory without collision
Generating trajectory of
swing limbs or center of
gravity using polynomial
functions is a well-known
strategy for walking [12]
and stair climbing [13]. We
used polynomial functions
for generating trajectories of
swing links and base link.
Then, using the base link
trajectory as the initial states
and using the swing links
trajectories as the target
positions, we solve the
inverse kinematics problem
and generate the trajectory for whole-body joints angles.
Each trajectory has some constraints, for example it has
to be collision-free. Swing link constraints are follows:
1779
1) Going through 2 points without collision
2) Zero velocities and accelerations at start/end points
3) Maintain positions and orientations of start/end points
4) 5cm away from the contact surface at end point
Fourth constraint is an important margin for safety with
real robots, since there will be some differences between the
planned motion and the actual motion due to modeling errors
or slight changes of body shape. Then, the humanoid robot
may run into the step surface before landing on the target
destination.
Sampling collision free points are achieved through 3
steps: First, draw line between start and end points of swing
links. Second, split the line into 3 line segments. And last, if
any one of these 2 points has collision with the other models,
move it to the direction of normal vector of collision plane.
This is very simple algorithm and some other algorithms may
be needed in more complex situations, but, in the following
experiments, this was sufﬁcient.
The constraints of base link trajectory are follows:
1) Zero velocities and accelerations at start/end points
2) Maintain positions and orientations of start/end points
B. Determination of the time of movement on trajectory
Fig. 12. Average and instantaneous torque of the knee pitch joints while
climbing a ladder
We determine the time of movement using two torque
limitations: limitations for 3-second average joint torque and
instantaneous one. Average limitation is 0.7 times smaller
than the instantaneous one. In experiments with real hu-
manoid robots, there will be some noise, and some margins
of torque limitations are essential. But for high load motion
such as steep climbing, instantaneous high joint torque is
needed. To satisfy these two conﬂicting requirements, we
use 3 seconds average joint torque limitation in addition
to the instantaneous one. Average and instantaneous torque
limitations have the opposite nature with regards to time of
movement.
Fig.12 are graphs of joint torque calculated using equation
of motion while climbing a ladder in simulation. The top one
is average torque, and the bottom one is instantaneous torque.
The faster the robot moves, the higher the instantaneous joint
torques are. On the contrary, The slower robot moves, the
higher the average joint torques are. Gradually changing the
time spent on moving and estimating the joint’s torque, it is
possible to determine the time to satisfy both constraints.
V. CLIMBING EXPERIMENT IN REAL WORLD
To evaluate our planner, we performed three climbing
experiments with a life-sized humanoid robot, HRP-2.
A. Climbing a ladder

In the end, we succeeded in climbing up and down two
steps. In addition, with simple balance control using a force

using a 3D mouse, we succeeded in grasping a bag located

in 120 sec.

VI. CONCLUSION
We have proposed a novel whole-body motion planner for
generating safe motions that are as far away from limitations
of joint Torque, contact Force, and contact Moment (TFM
limitation) as possible. We introduced Body Retention Load
Vector (BRLV) and formulated humanoid robot’s motion
planning as an optimization procedure considering both TFM
limitations and minimizing of BRLV. In order to show the
effectiveness of our approach, we had experiments both in
simulation and real world. In simulation, we applied our
planner to climbing motions of ladders and a rock wall. And
in real world, we demonstrated the motions of climbing a
ladder and getting into a car with real a life-sized humanoid
robot HRP-2.
