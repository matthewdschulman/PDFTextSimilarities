Abstract— In this paper, we propose an optimization scheme
for deriving task-speciﬁc force closure grasps for underactuated
robot hands. Motivated by recent neuroscientiﬁc studies on
the human grasping behavior, a novel grasp strategy is built
upon past analysis regarding the task-speciﬁcity of human
grasps, that also complies with the recent soft synergy model
of underactuated hands. Our scheme determines an efﬁcient
force closure grasp (i.e., conﬁguration and contact points/forces)
with a posture compatible with the desired task, taking into
consideration the mechanical and geometric limitations imposed
by the design of the hand and the object shape. The efﬁciency
of the algorithm is veriﬁed through simulated paradigms on a
hypothetical underactuated hand with the kinematic model of
the DLR/HIT II ﬁve ﬁngered robot hand.
I. INTRODUCTION
During the past decades, the design of dexterous multiﬁn-
gered hands, with plenty degrees of freedom, has received
increased attention in an effort to reproduce the functionality
and dexterity of human hands. However, building fully
actuated multiﬁngered hands requires mounting motors at
all DOFs (degrees of freedom), which increases the design
complexity, the weight and the cost of the hand. Therefore,
in order to relax the aforementioned issues, researchers have
focused on the design of underactuated hand mechanisms
(i.e., hands with fewer actuators than DOFs), in which the
kinematics are deﬁned by coordinated patterns of joint move-
ments. Such a direction was also supported by recent neuro-
scientiﬁc studies on human grasping. A series of experiments
in [1], [2] veriﬁed that when humans grasp simple everyday
life objects, aiming at performing simple manipulation tasks,
the hand kinematics follow speciﬁc motion coordination pat-
terns, commonly referred to as synergies. As it was shown in
[1], after performing Principal Components Analysis (PCA)
in kinematic data captured during human grasps, a high
correlation between the hand’s DOFs is evident. In particular,
the ﬁrst two principal components can account in most cases
for more than 80% of the variance.
The aforementioned inference was the motivation behind
the extensive research that emerged, not only in theory
but also in a software and hardware level, emphasizing
particularly on the grasping problem of underactuated hands.

grasps by searching in a subspace of the hand’s conﬁguration
space is proposed and numerical results are presented for
real robot hand models. The subspace consists of a subset of
all synergies that account for the generation of the grasping
action. In [4], the property of form-closure is extended to
apply for underactuated hands. In [5], a model is proposed
for the generation of grasping forces by synergistic underac-
tuated hands. In particular, the concept of soft synergies is
introduced in order to take into account the compliance of the
object and the hand mechanism. This model is also adopted
in [6], where an optimization scheme is employed to calcu-
late force closure grasps. In parallel, signiﬁcant developments
have been realized towards the hardware implementation of
underactuated hands. In this ﬁeld, the works presented in [7],
[8], [9] and [10] are among the most noteworthy.
In the context of the ongoing research concerning un-
deractuated hands, emphasis has been devoted to their as-
sociation with the grasping tasks to be executed. In [11],
the authors present a kinematic modeling for underactuated
elastic hands, such that the classical manipulability measures
can be applied to assess the hand’s capability to execute
a manipulation task. In [12], a manipulability analysis for
soft synergy underactuated hands is implemented, aiming
at evaluating their performance in the task space. Such an
approach is compatible with our everyday life experience
as well. When humans grasp objects, they intuitively adapt
their hand posture according to the object and the task they
want to perform. This observation has been conﬁrmed by
several studies. In particular, in [2] it was shown that when
humans are able to estimate the weight and center of mass of
an object, they tend to predetermine accordingly the grasping
forces required for the object’s lift and also select appropriate
contact points that facilitate the task execution. In [13], the
selection of grasping postures by humans was studied. More
speciﬁcally, human subjects performed different manipula-
tion tasks with various objects and post processing of their
hands’ kinematics veriﬁed that they actually adopted grasp-
ing postures which tended to maximize the force/velocity
transmitted to the object along the direction required for the
successful execution of the tasks considered.
The problem of deriving optimal grasps wrt the task to
be executed has been studied in the past for fully actuated
hands and many different approaches have been proposed
(an overview of the most noteworthy among them can be
found in [14]). The main difﬁculty of this problem arises
from appropriately modeling a grasping task. In this direc-
tion, the idea of representing the wrench/twist transmission
capabilities of a grasp with task ellipsoids has been widely
adopted. Based on this representation, Li and Sastry, in
2014 IEEE International Conference on Robotics & Automation (ICRA)

[15], ﬁrst formulated a task-oriented quality measure, the
maximization of which leads to a grasp that favors the
execution of the task considered. They also formulated a
corresponding optimization problem and provided numerical
examples for a planar grasp of a two-ﬁngered fully actuated
hand.
In our paper, motivated by the aforementioned neurosci-
entiﬁc studies and based on the task representation using
the task ellipsoids, we address the problem of deriving task-
speciﬁc force closure grasps for underactuated hands. Given
the recent advances in the ﬁeld of synergistic hands, this
problem needs to be studied through a new perspective, since
the synergistic degrees of actuation (DoAs) may favor or
complicate the execution of a desired task depending on the
hand posture (conﬁguration/contact points). Based on this
observation and adopting the “soft synergy” hand model,
we formulate an optimization scheme that leads to a force
closure grasp of low contact force distribution with a posture
(conﬁguration/contact points) that favors the transmission of
the required wrench/twist along the directions imposed by the
task considered. Towards this goal, we use the transformation
of the Hand-Object Jacobian [16], [17] in a metric similar
to the “Task Compatibility Index”, originally developed for
manipulators in [18] and modiﬁed for grasping in [16]. Our
scheme determines the conﬁguration of the hand, along with
its wrist’s position/orientation and contact force distribution
so that it is compatible with a given grasping task. The whole
approach is independent of the speciﬁc degree of actuation
which can simply be described through its corresponding
“synergy” or “eigengrasp” matrices. Furthermore, the ge-
ometric and mechanical limitations, imposed by the hand
design are also taken into consideration in the proposed
formulation. Finally, it should be noted that although in
this work we only consider precision grasps, the proposed
scheme can be modiﬁed to derive power grasps as well.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section II
formulates the problem; Section III presents the methodology
in details while Section IV veriﬁes the efﬁciency of the
proposed scheme through simulated paradigms on a hand
with the kinematic model (DH parameters and DOFs) of the
DLR/HIT Hand II. Finally, Section V concludes the paper.
II. PROBLEM FORMULATION
A. Rigid Body Grasping Model
Consider an n
c
-ﬁngered robot hand, consisting of n
q
rotational DOFs in total, grasping an object with n
c
ﬁngertip
contacts. Let us denote the contact wrench of the grasp by
f=

f

T

T
2Â
mn
c
, where f
i

m
is the vector of
the i-th generalized contact force, deﬁned relative to a local
framefC

i
; o
i
g, from which n
i
is normal
to the contact tangent plane and points towards the object,
while the two others are orthogonal and lie on the contact
tangent plane. The dimension m depends on the adopted
contact model. In our analysis we adopt the Hard Finger
(HF) model [19], which assumes that only the three force
components of each contact wrench can be transmitted from
each ﬁnger to the object. Thus, m= 3 in our case.
The contribution g2Â

of the contact force distribution
to the wrench applied at the object’s center of mass, deﬁned
relative to a global reference framefNg is given by g= Gf
where G2Â

Regarding the twist applied at the object, only the transla-
tional twist components of each contact are considered to
contribute to it. In particular, let us denote the contact twist
by the vector=

object twist2Â

can be related to the contact twists as:
 = G

Finally, the contact twists can be related to the joint angular
velocities ˙ q2Â

through the Hand Jacobian as follows:
 = J˙ q (3)
B. Introduction of Synergies
We introduce the concept of synergies in our grasp anal-
ysis as presented in the works of Santello et al. [1], [5] and
Allen et al. [3]. We assume that the full synergy or eigen-
grasp matrix
¯
S2Â

is available.
¯
S consists of columns
containing the principal components of the human grasp,
ranked in a decreasing order wrt their relative contribution
to the variance of the human grasp. Therefore, depending
on the speciﬁc underactuated robot hand design (number of
synergistic degrees of freedom n
s
), a submatrix S2Â
n
q
n
s
(1n

) can be extracted from
¯
S in order to relate the
high dimensional space of the hand’s DOFs q
r

with
the low dimensional space of the synergistic DoAs2Â
n

:
q
r

where ¯ q2Â

wrt time and substituting into (3), we obtain:
 = J

Similarly, we may derive the relationship between the gen-
eralized synergistic forces 2Â

joints:

Finally, employing (1) and (6) in (7), we get:

C. The Soft Synergy
For an underactuated multiﬁngered hand, the kinematic
model (4) is not sufﬁcient to realistically describe a grasp.
The interaction with a grasped object needs to be modeled
and introduced in the analysis as well. This has recently been
done with the “Soft Synergy”, a modeling framework [5], [6]
which allows the hand’s kinematics to be driven by synergies
in a way that the ﬁnal posture comports with the geometry
of the grasped object. This is accomplished by considering
the structural compliance of the hand as well as the stiffness
of the object.

was extracted from [6].
More speciﬁcally, during a grasp, as the ﬁngertips of
the hand make contact with the object, forces appear and
as a result, torques at the ﬁnger joints too. These torques
modify the hand posture according to the contact and joint
compliance so that the hand comports with the object shape
(see Fig. 1). This phenomenon can be expressed through
the following equation, relating each reference conﬁguration

is the diagonal joint compliance matrix
which maps the torques on the joints due to ﬁngertip contacts

D. Force Closure
Force closure [19] is the main prerequisite for stable
grasps. It can be guaranteed by the satisfaction of two types
conditions: i) the object’s equilibrium and ii) the friction
constraints. The balance equation for the generalized forces
applied to the object, can be written as follows:
Gf= f
ext
(11)
where f
ext
2Â

is the external wrench applied at the object’s
center of mass. Adopting the grasping force decomposition
model proposed in [6], the general solution to the force
distribution problem (11) can be derived as follows:
f= G
R
K
( f
ext
)+(I  G
R
K
G)(K

Dp+ K

The ﬁrst component (particular solution) of (12) accounts
for the compensation of the external wrench applied to the
object, while the second (homogeneous solution) represents
the active internal forces of the grasp. In this model, the
internal forces are produced i) through virtual displacements
Dp2Â
mn
c
of the ﬁngertips due to the modiﬁcation of the
hand posture according to the soft synergy model (eq. 10)
and ii) through inﬁnitesimal deformations dp2Â
mn
c
of the
object at the contact points due to the object stiffness. These
displacements that parameterize the homogeneous solution
can be related to the corresponding joint displacements as
Dp= JDq (13)

and consequently to corresponding synergistic displacements

and d2Â

as:

respectively and m denotes
the friction coefﬁcient between the contact surfaces of the
ﬁngers and the object. These inequalities, which are com-
monly referred to as “friction cone” constraints due to their
geometrical representation, constrain the normal components
of the contact forces to be non-negative, which indicates that
the ﬁngers tend to squeeze the object.
E. Grasp Quality Measures
As it can be inferred from the previous description, force
closure is quite a generic criterion. For a multiﬁngered hand
with multiple degrees of freedom, there might be an inﬁnite
number of force closure grasps. In this paper, we focus
on producing grasps that are compatible with i) the hand’s
mechanical design, ii) the hand’s synergistic type of actuation
and iii) the speciﬁcations of the grasping task to be executed.
The need for such an approach arises from the fact that the
robot hand’s kinematics, as well as its ability to exert the
desired wrench or twist to the grasped object is constrained
by its underactuated design. Therefore, the object should
be grasped in a way that a low contact force distribution
can guarantee stability and a satisfactory (wrt the task
considered) wrench/twist can be transmitted to the grasped
object. Such requirements can be addressed through the
optimization of Grasp Quality measures [16]. In this paper,
apart from force closure, two more criteria are considered: a
criterion associated with the contact force minimization and
a criterion which quantiﬁes the compatibility of a grasp with
the speciﬁcations of a certain task.
Regarding the contact force minimization, the norm of the
normal contact force components has been adopted:
F(f)=
s
n
c
å
i=1
f
n
i
2
(18)
The minimization of this metric, through the satisfaction of
the friction cone constraints imposed by the force closure
property, leads to the overall minimization of the contact
force distribution.
To address the problem of producing a grasp (conﬁgura-
tion/contact points) that favors the desired task execution,
it is important that we ﬁrst provide an appropriate task
deﬁnition. Several approaches have been proposed towards
modeling a task [14]. In our case, a task is described
through its requirements in wrench/twist transmission to the
grasped object. To optimally execute a grasping/manipulation
3678
task, the transmission of an object wrench and/or twist of
speciﬁc range towards a speciﬁc direction is required.Since
the grasping posture can affect the wrench/twist transmission
to the object, our objective is to derive a grasp (conﬁg-
uration/contact points) that maximizes the ability of the
hand to meet the demands of the task. Towards this goal,
we are based on the Hand-Object Jacobian transformation
[16], [17], which we modify appropriately to build a grasp
compatibility metric for the case of underactuated hands with
synergistic actuation. In particular, employing (2) and (5), we
derive:
G
T
= J
s
˙  (19)
from which we arrive at:
=(G

where G

(GG

denotes the generalized
right inverse of the grasp matrix. Let us now deﬁne theHand-
Object Jacobian for an underactuated hand with synergistic
DoAs:
H
s
= G
†
J
s
(21)
In this respect, (20) becomes:
= H
s
˙  (22)
Similarly, we derive the relationship between the generalized
synergy forces and the wrench applied to the object as
follows:
= H
T
s
g (23)
Notice from (22) that a unit ball in the synergy velocity space
(i.e., ˙ 
T
˙  = 1) is mapped to its contribution to the object
twist through the following velocity ellipsoid:

T
(H
s
H

)
 1
= 1 (24)
In the same direction, we conclude from (23) that a unit
ball in the generalized synergy force space (i.e.,
T
= 1) is
mapped to its contribution to the object wrench through the
force ellipsoid:
g
T
(H

Therefore, we can derive the expressions of the correspond-

(27)
where d2Â
6
denotes the unit vector that deﬁnes a desired
wrench/twist transmission direction. These ratios, when max-
imized, lead to a maximum transmission of twist or wrench
to the object towards the direction speciﬁed by d. This is
equivalent to aligning the major axis of the corresponding
ellipsoid to the direction deﬁned by the task speciﬁcations. In
particular, if we want to maximize the wrench transmission
along the directions deﬁned by the vectors d
i
; i= 1;;k,
we need to maximize the corresponding transmission ratios
a
i
. Alternatively, in order to maximize the twist transmission
along the directions deﬁned by the vectors d
j
; j= 1;;l,
we need to maximize the corresponding transmission ratios
b

. The aforementioned speciﬁcations can be achieved by
minimizing theGraspCompatibilityIndexforUnderactuated

III. THE TASK-SPECIFIC GRASP SELECTION SCHEME
FOR UNDERACTUATED HANDS
In this paper, the problem of deriving an optimal force
closure grasp wrt the force distribution and the task speciﬁ-
cations for underactuated hands is formulated as an optimiza-
tion scheme. The speciﬁc hand design is introduced in the
formulation through the use of the “synergy” matrix. As de-
cision variables we consider the synergistic inﬁnitesimal dis-
placements d2Â
n
s
, which contribute to the generation of
the internal forces, along with the hand’s conﬁguration in the
synergy space 2Â
n
s
and the wrist’s position/orientation
w2Â
6
. The contact force distribution is derived through
(17). Finally, we assume that a dexterous robot manipulator
will be able to place the wrist in the speciﬁc position and ori-
entation extracted by the optimization algorithm, which can
be done for example in an anthropomorphic way following
the approach proposed in [21].
In particular, let the vector of the decision variables
be denoted by x =

which represents the torques on the joints due to contact and
joint compliance. The term D represents the modiﬁcation
of the hand posture as forced by the object shape and
compliance as described in [6]. Furthermore, the selection
of  and d guarantees not only that the ﬁngertips make
contact with the object, but also that the internal forces pro-
duced are such that the friction cone constraints are satisﬁed.
Finally, the constraint (32) represents the requirement that the
ﬁngertip contact locations p

, calculated by the forward
kinematics for the ﬁnal modiﬁed posture lie on the object’s
surface ¶O.
Remark 1. In the case of multiﬁngered hands with an abduc-
tion/adduction DOF at each ﬁnger base frame, the collision
avoidance between the ﬁngers opposed to the thumb can also
be ensured. Such constraints can be expressed for example
through inequalities of the form q

where q

denote the angular displacements of the
abduction/adduction DOFs of all ﬁngers opposed to the
thumb, ranked in their physical order (e.g. index, middle,
ring and pinky for a ﬁve-ﬁngered hand).

Remark 2. An additional requirement that no link of the
robot hand penetrates the grasped object may be introduced
by a constraint of the form(p
i

)
T
O=? for all neighbor-
ing robot hand joints i; j, where the vectors p

represent the locations of the corresponding joints.
Given the analytical description of the object’s geometry,
such constraints can be easily formulated as inequality con-
straints that can be integrated in the optimization scheme.
IV. RESULTS
A hypothetical hand with the kinematic model (DH pa-
rameters, DOFs) of the DLR/HIT II robot hand [22] was
considered for the simulated paradigms. DLR/HIT II is a
multiﬁngered robot hand with ﬁve kinematically identical
ﬁngers. Each ﬁnger has four DOFs, the last two of which
are mechanically coupled with a transmission ratio 1:1.
The efﬁciency of the proposed optimization scheme is
tested by considering simple grasping tasks with a cylindrical
object of diameter 6 cm, height 15 cm and weight 200 gr. The
friction coefﬁcient between the surface of the ﬁngers and the
object was set to be 0.8, the diagonal elements of the stiffness
matrix K
c
were considered to be equal to 100.000 N/m, while
the diagonal elements of C
s
and C
q
were set equal to 0.1 N/m
and 0.1 Nm/

respectively. The grasping tasks were described
as directions of desired wrench transmission to the object’s
center of mass. Regarding the derivation of the numerical
results presented, the SQP algorithm [23] for constrained
nonlinear optimization provided by the MATLAB Optimiza-
tion Toolbox (Mathworks Inc.) was used. The algorithm was
initialized at the same infeasible point (no contact with the
object was made) in all cases. Due to the highly nonlinear
nature of the problem, different initializations would lead
to different local minima and different corresponding ﬁnal
postures. However, a signiﬁcant advantage of the proposed
optimization algorithm is its ability to converge to a desired
solution after very few iterations, in contrast to global
methods which require much higher computational cost.
In the subsequent simulations, we altered the number
of synergistic DoAs n
s
of the hand and considered two
different grasping tasks. We also studied the effect of various

full synergy matrix which deﬁnes the synergistic DoAs was
extracted from a Principal Component Analysis on human
data collected in our laboratory. In particular, the hand
kinematics of three different human subjects were captured
using the Cyberglove II (Cyberglove Systems) motion cap-
ture system (dataglove) while they were performing simple
grasping tasks with every day life objects.

scheme. More speciﬁcally, in Fig. 2, a grasp is selected for
performing a translation task towards the direction denoted
by the cyan vector. The task was considered to be equivalent
to force transmission along that axis. Results are provided
for various DoAs, namely 1, 2, 3 and 15 (i.e., fully actuated)
in subﬁgures 2.a, 2.b, 2.c and 2.d respectively. Notice that
when the hand is actuated with very few DoAs, the grasp
is far from being task compatible. However, increasing n
s
leads to more optimized postures with respect to the task
speciﬁcity metric C
s
, as the major axes of their force
ellipsoids are more aligned with the desired direction (the
angle between them is smaller). This can also be veriﬁed
from the left side of Table I, where the angles between the
task direction and the major axes of the force ellipsoid are
presented. Moreover, as n
s
increases, the force distribution
keeps decreasing. At the same time however, the number
of iterations needed until the convergence of the algorithm
increases, which seems reasonable owing to the increase of
the number of decision variables. Regarding the postures
adopted, we can see that although the results obtained for
1, 2 and 3 DoAs are similar, the improvement of the grasp
quality is signiﬁcant. This comes from the fact that as n
s
increases, the variety of achievable postures becomes wider.
This is particularly evident in Fig. 2.d, where the 15 DoAs
led a posture with a signiﬁcantly improved grasp quality.
When the hand’s kinematics are dictated by 15 different
DoAs (i.e., it is fully actuated), it can achieve more complex
postures and consequently adapt better to the speciﬁcations
of a given task. Finally, it should be mentioned that in all
the aforementioned runs, the ratio w
F
=w
C
was set equal to
10

.
Similar comments can be made for Fig. 3, where the
grasp is selected so that it facilitates the execution of a
translation task along the direction indicated. The subﬁgures
3.a, 3.b, 3.c, 3.d depict the results for a hand with 1, 2, 3
and 15 DoAs respectively. As n
s
increases, better alignment
between the task direction and the major axis of the force
ellipsoid is achieved. This is also conﬁrmed in the right
three columns of Table I where the corresponding angles
are presented. Similarly with the previous task, the required
force distribution decreases as n
s
increases. Finally, in this
case the ratio w
F
=w
C
was constantly set equal to 10
 5
.
Table II contains quantitative results concerning the de-
pendence of the algorithm on the selection of the weights
of the objective function components F and C
s
. In order to
compare the results for various weights, we considered the
same task (translation along the green axis in Fig. 2) and
DoAs (n
s
= 3). We can see that when the ratio w
F
=w
C
is
small, the alignment of the force ellipsoid’s major axis with
the desired direction is satisfactory (the corresponding angle
is small) while less signiﬁcance is attributed to the force
distribution, which tends to be high. However, as the ratio

increases, the force distribution is getting lower, causing the
alignment to deteriorate.
V. FUTURE DIRECTIONS
Future research directions involve the integration of the
proposed algorithm with a post-optimality procedure for
improving grasp quality, as described in [24], aiming at
reinforcing the robustness of the methodology against un-
certainties regarding the object as well as the robotic hand
artifact itself. Besides, we plan on performing experiments
with real underactuated hands such as the one presented in
[10] in order to verify the efﬁciency of the proposed grasping
strategy.
