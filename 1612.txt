AbstractÑ The quest for ever faster pick-and-place robots
has led to ingenious parallel robots with reduced mobility, e.g.,
capable of producing motions proper of SCARA systems: three
independent translations and one rotation about an axis of Þxed
direction. These robots are also known as Schšnßies-motion
generators (SMG). Some parallel versions are commercially
available, as are serial-parallel designs. The former are provided
with four limbs, the latter with three, the fourth degree of
freedom being appended in series with a Delta robot. Parallel
robots are more attractive than their hybrid counterparts, but
the presence of four legs poses serious challenges to their
designers, as limb-interference limits the rotatability of the
moving plate. A solution to this problem includes a gear train
for rotation-range ampliÞcation, but this increases the inertial
load on the motors and complicates the designÑtoo many
partsÑand the controlÑbecause of inherent gear backlash and
Coulomb friction. Recently, a SMG system was proposed that
is supplied with two limbs, arrayed in an isostatic structure,
which provides high rotatability of its gripper. This robot is
driven by one C (cylindrical)-joint at each limb. As this joint
allows for two degrees of freedom, it calls for two motors, that
might as well be Þxed to the base, which poses interesting design
challenges. Reported in this paper is a design solution for the
drive of a C joint, which is termed the C (cylindrical)-drive,
based on a cylindrical differential mechanism of the RHHR
type, with R standing for revolute, H for helical (or screw)
joint. The design, kinematics and dynamics of the drive are
discussed, along with a realization, and preliminary tests.
I. INTRODUCTION
The motivation behind the work reported here is the need
for ever faster pick-and-place robots, as required by assembly
and packaging operations. The unprecedented growth in the
number and variety of hand-held electronic devices calls for
extremely fast robots required for the assembly of these
devices, whose parts exhibit an essentially ßat geometry.
Another area calling for fast pick-and-place operations (PPO)
is the food-processing industry, especially with regard to
packaging.
The manipulation of the payload in the above application
areas includes, as a rule, three independent translations and
one rotation about an axis of Þxed orientation, usually
vertical. This kind of motion, therefore, is short of two
degrees of freedom (dof)Ñwith respect to the free motion of
rigid objects in spaceÑnamely, tilt about two non-parallel,
horizontal axes. The motions of interest are known to involve

the set of four-dof rigid-body displacements termed the
Schšnßies subgroup [1] of the group of six-dof rigid-body
motions. This subgroup can best be visualized as the set
of displacements undergone by the tray of a waiter. Any
mechanical system capable of producing such motions is
hence termed a Schšnßies-motion generator (SMG). The old-
est SMGs date back to the early eighties, which were dubbed
SCARA (Selective Compliance Assembly Robot Arm) [2].
These systems bear a serial architecture that comprises three
revolute (R) joints of parallel axes and one prismatic (P) joint
of direction parallel to these axes.
The industry has proposed a test cycle that consists of: a)
a vertical upward translation of 25 mm; b) a horizontal 300-
mm translation with a concurrent 180
?
rotation; c) a vertical
downward 25-mm translation; and d) back to the departing
poseÑposition and orientationÑfollowing the same path
and the same motion program backwards [3]. In the late
nineties, Adept Technology Inc., of Livermore, CA, boasted
cycle times of their SCARA COBRA s600 of 500 ms. The
same company now offers a parallel version of the old
SCARA systems, the Quattro
TM
s650H robot
1
, reportedly
capable of cycle times of 333 ms. This robot owes its
origins to a concept invented by a Franco-Japanese team [4].
Further reducing the foregoing record cycle-time is the new
challenge.
A hybrid SMG, ABB IRB 340 FlexPicker
2
, features a
Delta architecture [5], carrying three limbs that drive a
moving platform (MP) through purely translational motions
in 3D space. In series with the Delta system is a R joint
mounted on the Delta MP, providing a rotation about a
vertical axis. The latter is driven from the robot base via
a Cardan, telescopic shaft. This array allows the FlexPicker
to produce large-amplitude rotations. The complexity of this
robot lies both in the mechanical transmission required to
drive the R joint and in the diversity of its actuators, as the
actuator of the latter is different from the three of the Delta.
A novel architecture was recently proposed that provides
a high rotatability of the MP without the need of an extra
transmission, and may be driven with four identical actuators
[6]. Shown in Fig. 1(a) is a depiction of the proposed
architecture, composed of two identical arms of the CRRH
type, with the actuated C joint of each limb mounted on a
Þxed base. The arrows indicate the independent translation
and rotation of the actuated C joints. Here, what plays the

driven in a form similar to that of a waiter when spreading
pepper on a dinerÕs plate. The Peppermill is thus driven by
two H-joints of distinct pitches.

An interesting feature of the SMG of Fig. 1(a) is its
isostatic nature, as explained in Section II. For this reason,
this robot is henceforth termed the Isostatic SMG (ISMG).
II. DESIGN PRINCIPLES
The drives of the ISMG must implement the two dof of
each limb by producing rotations and translations. This poses
an interesting design challenge, as off-the-shelf actuated C
joints are not available. In producing a conceptual design
of the drive, the basic principle adopted is simplicity. To
this end, the authors resort to a paradigm for the conceptual
design of kinematic chains made of lower kinematic pairs
(LKP)Ñrevolute R, prismatic P, helical or screw H, cylin-
drical C, planar F and spherical SÑbased on complexity
measures [7]. Moreover, the Þrst three LKP are simple, in
that they allow for one single dof between the links under
coupling. C allows for two dof, while the last two for three.
According to the above-mentioned paradigm, the complex-
ity of a kinematic chain grows with the number of kinematic
pairs (joints), while the LKP are ordered in increasing order
of complexity: R, P, H, C, F, S. Moreover, the concepts put
forth by HervŽ [8] on the use of Lie groups in the qualitative
synthesis of kinematic chains are exploited.
Under the principle of complexity-reduction,
1) The number of joints must be as low as possible;
2) A R joint is preferred over a P joint, and a P joint over
a H joint;
3) Use as many identical joints as possible, as complexity
grows with their diversity.
Now, upon application of the theory of Lie groups to the
synthesis of kinematic chains, a C joint can be synthesized by
means of a serial array of two simple LKP: PR (or RP); RH
(or HR); PH (or HP); and HH. In these arrays, the direction
of motion allowed by the P joint should be parallel to the
axis of the R or the H joint, while, in the case of the RH
array, the two joints must be co-axial. Finally, in the case
of the HH array, the two H pairs must be co-axial and of
different pitches.
Under the ranking of the LKP by order of complexity, the
simplest choice is a PR array, the most complex a HH array.
However, synthesizing a C joint by means of a PR array calls
for two completely different actuators, one translational and
one rotational, which contributes to the actuator complexity.
We thus adopt two more design principles:
4) Reduce the diversity of the actuators; and
5) for purposes of a uniform load-distribution, Þx the two
actuators to the base.
The Þrst of the two foregoing principles leads to a RH
array, the second to a closed kinematic chain, namely a
RHHR chain, which allows for two identical rotary actuators
Þxed to the base. The RHHR chain can be found to have a
dof f = 2, if the theory of Lie groups is invoked, together
with the Chebyshev-GrŸbler-Kutzbach (CGK) formula in the
version suggested by HervŽ [8]:
f =d(l?1)?rj (1)
whered is the dimension of the subgroupÑof the rigid-body
displacement groupÑto which the chain belongs; j is the
number of joints;l the number of links; andr the number of
constraints imposed by the joints, under the assumption that
all joints allow for the same mobility, which is the case at
hand. Indeed, in our case, the chain belongs to the cylindrical
subgroup, of dimension 2, one rotation about an axis and one
translation in the direction of this axis. The number of joints
is 4, while the number of links is also 4 and r = 1, as
each joint takes away one dof of the two of the cylindrical
subgroup. Therefore, f = 2, as desired. However, for the
above formula to be correct, the pitches of the H joints must
be distinct [8].
The RHHR chain is topologically symmetric. It can be
rendered geometrically symmetric as well, and hence, of
lowest complexity, if the two pitches are chosen identical,
but of opposite hands, one right-, the other left-hand. The
realization of the RHHR joint thus leads to a cylindrical
differential mechanism, as will be made apparent in the
sequel. An embodiment of the RHHR chain is included in
Fig. 2.
6339
Fig. 2. An embodiment of the RHHR kinematic chain of the C-drive
Returning to the complete ISMG, upon application of the
CGK formula to the kinematic chain shown in Fig. 1(a), we
observe that the formula of eq. (1) applies to a chain with all
its joints of the same mobility. In the chain at hand, however,
the C joint has a double mobilityÑit allows for two dofÑ
and hence, the above formula cannot be applied directly. For
this reason, the C joint is conceptually decomposed into two
simple joints, R and P, for example. Under these conditions,
d = 6, l = 10, j = 10 and r = 5. Hence, the CGK formula
yields
f = 6(10?1)?5?10 = 4 (2)
which is the dof of a SMG. What the CGK formula does
not provide is the kind of motion that this chain generates.
This was done by resorting to the theory of Lie groups by
the proponents of the architecture of the ISMG [6].
III. THE MATHEMATICAL MODEL
The model that describes the relations among the various
parameters and the motion variables of the C joint, in both
the Cartesian and the joint domains, is derived here. The
kinematics of the full ISMG was derived in [9].
A. Kinematics
Figure 1(b) illustrates the design model of the driven
C joint, termed C (cylindrical)-drive, as actuated by two
identical rotational motors in a differential array of helicalÑ
screwÑdrives.
The relationships between the translational and angular
displacements of the C-drive collar, u and ?, respectively,
and the angular displacements of the motors,?
L
and?
R
, are
derived below. It is apparent from Fig. 1(b) that the sliding
u of the collar is proportional to either?
L
?? or?
R
??, the
proportionality constant being p
L
/2¹ or, correspondingly,
p
R
/2¹. Hence,
p

p
R
2¹
(?
R
??) =u (3)
wherep
L
andp
R
represent the pitches of the left-hand screw
and its right-hand counterpart, respectively. Moreover, notice
that for the two equations (3) to be independent, and hence,
useful to control the collar motion, p
L
should be different
from p
R
. This relation is in agreement with the condition
invoked from the theory of Lie groupsÑsee Section II.
In order to simplify the design of both the mechanical
system and the control scheme of the C-drive, we introduce
symmetry as the sixth design principle:
p
L
=p, p
R
=?p (4)
From eqs. (3 & 4), the relationships between the displace-
ments of the collar, u and ?, and the angular displacements
of the motors,?
L
and?
R
, are expressed by a system of two
linear equations, namely,

(10)
Given the form of J, when the two actuators turn by the
same amount in the same direction, a pure rotation of the
collar is produced; when the actuators turn the same amount,
but in opposite directions, a pure translation is produced. This
is the functioning of a differential mechanism.
It is noteworthy that the new form ofJ is isotropic, in the
sense that J

J is proportional to the 2? 2 identity matrix

Isotropy is important, because this means that the transfor-
mation from actuator variables? to drive variables w, and
vice-versa, is done without roundoff-error ampliÞcation [10].
Moreover,

The beneÞt of an isotropic Jacobian goes beyond the nu-
merics, as isotropy means small errors in the drive vari-
ables lead to correspondingly small errors in their actuator
counterparts, and the other way around. Moreover, the two
actuators operate in close cooperation for virtually any single
task. Finally, in light of the constancy of the Jacobian, the
kinematic relation between rates follows:

B. Dynamics
The Euler-Lagrange formulation is applied to derive the
equations of motion of the C-drive. The mechanical system
has two degrees of freedom, its two independent generalized
coordinates being the angular displacements of the motors.
The total kinetic energyT of the mechanical system is thus

then M becomes proportional to the 2? 2 identity matrix,
with the proportionality factorI

/2. This matrix then be-
comes isotropic as well. Under this condition, the dynamics
of the system becomes decoupled. If one motor of the C-
drive accelerates, no reaction torque acts on the other motor.
Moreover, since the C-drive is Þxed to the machine frame,
the potential energy V of the system is constant, as gravity
doesnÕt intervene. In fact, the collar is not completely axially
symmetric, but the offset of its center of mass is negligible.
The Euler-Lagrange dynamics equations of the C-drive thus
become

IV. PROTOTYPE
A. Mechanism
The detailed design of the C-drive was guided by a
number of criteria, namely: high accuracy; high stiffness; low
complexity; modularity; ease of modiÞcation; and safety. As
this is a proof-of-concept protoype, the design embodiment is
not optimized. The fundamental dimensions of the drive were
chosen such that the ISMG can perform the standard industry

Fig. 4. Photograph of the C-drive and second unassembled base plate
test cycle. The C-drive consists of a precision-ground cast
aluminum base plate onto which the motors and ballscrew
supporting units are mounted and can be planarly adjusted.
A view of the mechanism is shown in Fig. 4. The customized
right- and left-handed ballscrews were supplied by THK
TM
,
models WTF3060 and WGF3060, respectively. Their lead is
p = 60 mm. The supporting units, model BK20, incorporate
pairs of angular contact ball bearings that support both radial
and thrust loads. In the center of the C-drive, the interface
between the two ballscrews is provided by a rotary coupling
containing a needle-roller bearing, supporting radial loads.
The collar connects the ball nut of each ballscrew together.
It is assembled from three pieces of aluminum 6061 to
avoid inaccuracies in coaxiality that arise from turning long
components on a lathe, as well as for ease of modiÞcation.
The middle segment will accommodate an arm of axis
normal to the that of the ballscrew, which will be a proximal
link of the ISMG, as illustrated schematically in Fig. 1(a).
A close-up photograph of the collar and a disassembled
ballscrew coupling is displayed in Fig. 5.
The total length of the C-drive is 1.5 m. The stroke of the
collar is approximately 210 mm, and terminated at either end
by a rubber bumper and a limit switch for safety. In future
Fig. 5. Close-up photograph of the C-drive, disassembled ballscrew
coupling and limit switch
testing, the stroke length will be expanded by shortening the
bumpers. This will enable the ISMG to perform the required
300 mm translation during the test cycle.
B. Control System
The C-drive is actuated by two 750 W Yaskawa SGMAH
08AAF4C AC servomotors, rated at 2.39 Nm and 3000
RPM. They are equipped with braking systems and 13-bit
incremental shaft encoders [11]. The motors are supplied
with two Yaskawa SGDH 08AE-S servomotor ampliÞers.
The control and feedback signals are acquired by the 24-
bit 2 MHz counters of a Sensoray
TM
626 PCI multifunction
I/O board, housed in the Òslave computerÓ running the real-
time operating system QNX
TM
. The Òmaster computerÓ,
running a Microsoft
TM
Windows operating system, relies
on the C-drive user interface in Mathworks
TM
Simulink
TM
,
using RT-LAB
TM
from OPAL-RT
TM
. Programming is done
in Simulink
TM
and compiled as C code on the master
computer. This is then loaded onto the slave computer, which
runs at a Þxed time step of 1 ms.
C. Control Topology
The C-drive is controlled via a PI controller with position
feedback and friction compensation. The servomotor ampli-
Þers receive current setpoints and their onboard encoders
return a discrete position signal. The PI gains K
P
and K
I
were determined experimentally. An exhaustive search was
performed for K
P
by testing at increments between 0.01
and 10 Nm/rad until the system became unstable. K

was
increased until the position offset converged. The gains are

D. Modeling and Estimation of the Dissipation Parameters
The Coulomb and viscous friction coefÞcients ?, ?, ?
and ?, generically refered to as the dissipation parameters,
were identiÞed experimentally. The friction in the needle-
roller bearing coupling the two ballscrews was considered
negligible and is thus ignored. The results obtained are
reproduced in Table I.
In order to identify the dissipation parameters, smooth,
slow motion programs were used, so as to make this iden-
tiÞcation task independent of the inertial parameters, those
appearing in matrix M. Moreover, as the Coulomb-friction
model is discontinuous, applying this model verbatim led to

The Þrst point is addressed by incorporating a dead zone

In a band centered about zero, this function vanishes. The
second point is addressed by imposing a rate limiter (RL) to
the output of every Coulomb friction term. The coefÞcients

E. Position Control
Three test motions of the collar were implemented: pure
translation; pure rotation; and helical motion. A smooth
polynomial is used to deÞne the three motion programs. In
order to obtain zero velocity, acceleration and jerk at the
endpoints, a 4-5-6-7 polynomials(?) [12] is introduced:

where ? is nondimensional time and 0²s² 1.
Based on eq. (13) and the numerical values recorded in
Table II, the ranges of motor velocities for the three motion
programs are obtained. In the reported tests, the periodic
motion programs were implemented at a frequency of 0.5
Hz, a conservative approach for preliminary tests. The Þrst
half of the cycle is deÞned over one second in the form

F . Test Results
Using the Jacobian J appearing in eq. (10), the motor
encoder position signal is fed back into the coordinates
w of the collar. Figures 6Ð8 display the error measured.

As expected, the error is largest during the accelerating and
decelerating portions of the motions, where highly accurate
positioning is not needed in PPO. In all tests, the error at
the endpoints was below 0.1 mm. From eq. (8), the error in
angle ? was never above 0.01 rad at the endpoints.
V. CONCLUSIONS
The overall design process leading to an innovative two-
dof robotic drive was outlined in the paper, from the con-
ceptual to the detailed design, followed by prototyping and

preliminary tests. Further work is needed to be able to
implement fast motions, as required by PPO. However, the
frequency at which the tests were conducted, 0.5 Hz, are
not much lower than the fundamental frequency at which
the fastest pick-and-place robot operates, namely, 3 Hz. It is
expected that, with suitable identiÞcation of the drive inertial
parameters, motions faster than 3 Hz will be achievable
through the use of dynamics compensation. Finally, the
integration of the drive and its companion into a parallel
SMG, in the coming months, should lead to a prototype
capable of competing with those out in the market.
