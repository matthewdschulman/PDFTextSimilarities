Modularized Global Equalization of Battery Cells for Electric Vehicles
Feng Ju, Weiwen Deng and Jingshan Li
Abstract—Battery management system has attracted mount-
ing research attention recently, within which cell equalization
plays a key role. Although many research and practices
have been devoted to developing system-level structure of cell
equalizers, there are still substantial opportunities for perfor-
mance improvement yet to investigate. This paper proposes
a novel architecture for battery cell equalization, referred to
as modularized global equalizer. The mathematical model is
developed to emulate the equalization dynamics by considering
both charging/discharging and energy loss. Analytical formulas
are derived to evaluate the performance of the global equalizer.
The proposed method is also compared with the state-of-the-art
structures in terms of equalization speed and energy loss.

I. INTRODUCTION
The increasing demand for alternative energy sources to
replace gasoline has triggered the development of battery
technologies for electric vehicles (EVs). The recent advances
in Lithium-ion batteries lead to a promising anticipation in
terms of performance, cost and customer acceptance [1].
Due to the voltage and power limitation of individual
battery cells, a battery pack in commercial applications
often consists of multiple cells to satisfy the energy re-
quirement. However, battery cells are manufactured with
certaintolerancesbothinthevoltageandpowerdensity.Such
inevitable differences within battery cells will drift apart
through cycling and could potentially lead to overcharging
or over discharging [2]. In addition, the ambient temperature
varieswithinthebatterypack,imposingimbalancedeffecton
cells in different positions. Therefore, to properly maintain
all cells balanced is of signiﬁcant importance for enhancing
battery life.
Mounting research efforts have been devoted to investigat-
ing efﬁcient cell equalization systems (see reviews [3] and
[4]).Fromthecontrolandsystemperspective,attentionshave
been mainly focused on the control scheme and topology
of equalization system. For instance, paper [5] presents a
switched capacitor equalizer for series strings of batteries,

whichprovestobecapableofachievingequilibriuminarea-
sonable time period through experiments. Paper [6] proposes
a modularized charge equalizer to alleviate the voltage stress
in the battery pack with a large number of cells. In paper [7],
a layer based equalization architecture is investigated, which
could reduce equalization time signiﬁcantly.
Despite these efforts, the existing equalization architec-
tures often require a large number of equalizers (comparable
to the number of battery cells). In addition to cost, this
will potentially reduce battery life when considering energy
loss associated with equalizers, which has been typically
ignored in the existing literature. Therefore, to investigate
an equalization system with fewer equalizers that can still
deliver robust performance is of great value. The main
contribution of this paper is in presenting a modularized
global equalization structure and investigating its dynamic
behavior of equalization speed and energy loss.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows:
Section II reviews the state-of-the-art equalization struc-
tures. Section III is devoted to proposing a modularized
global equalizer. In addition, the mathematical model and
its performances are evaluated analytically. In Section IV, a
comparative study is carried out using simulation to illustrate
the advantage of the proposed method. Finally, conclusions
are provided in Section V.
II. STATE-OF-THE-ART EQUALIZATION STRUCTURES
Consider a battery pack with an equalization system
described below.
(i) The battery pack consists of B serially connected bat-
teries, b
1
,b
2
,...,b
B
. Each cell is linked to a equalizer,
which can measure the cell’s state of charge (SOC) and
then equalize all the linked cells according to a certain
strategy.
(ii) All equalizers have the same equalization cycle?. Thus
the time axis is slotted with cycle time ?.
(iii) During a cycle ?, each battery b
i
could be either
discharged or charged at the rate d
i
or c
i
, respectively.
(iv) The efﬁciency of each equalizer e
i
is characterized by
its equalization rate r
i
. The energy loss rate associated
with each equalization is denoted as l
i
.
Extensive research has been devoted to investigating the
equalization structure for such a battery pack. In general,
serial-connected, module-based, and layer-based structures
have been proved efﬁcient and cost effective to balance the
SOC of the battery pack described by assumptions (i)-(iv).
Therefore, these three state-of-the-art methods are reviewed
in this section individually. Illustrations with a 8-cell battery
pack are shown in Figures 1-3, respectively.

connects consecutive pair of battery
cells b

• In each time slot, if cell b

,
equalizer e
i
will transfer r
i
units of charge from b
i
to
b
i+1
. Otherwise, the same amount of charge will be
transferred in the opposite direction. No transfer will
take place when the SOC of b

and b

are equal.

• All battery cells are evenly divided into M modules,
each with N battery cells.
• Within the module, (N?1) equalizers balance the SOC
of consecutive battery cells in the same manner as the
serial structure.
• In the module level, (M ? 1) equalizers are utilized
to connect consecutive pair of modules. In each time
slot, if module m
j
has a larger average SOC than
m
j+1
, then the equalizer connecting them, e
jN
, will
take r

and transfer the same amount to each cell in module

• Equalizers are arranged as a binary tree structure with

B layers. In layer s, there are B/2
s
equalizers,
s = 1,...,log

B.
• Speciﬁcally for the ﬁrst layer, every pair of battery cells
are connected with an equalizer in between. An upper
parallel layer of equalizers combines every two lower
layerequalizerstogether.Byanalogy,thesamestructure
propagates to the top layer with only one equalizer.
• Each equalizer essentially connects two modules of
battery cells combined by equalizers in the lower layer.
Therefore, energy transfers in the same manner as the
module structure.

presented and compared with the above structures.
III. MODULARIZED GLOBAL EQUALIZATION
Alltheequalizationstructureslistedintheprevioussection
are being widely used in practice. However, one common
concern is that they typically require a large number of
equalizers (e.g., (B?1) equalizers for all three structures). It
becomesevenmoreproblematicwhenconsideringtheenergy
loss during equalization. Therefore, a new structure with less
equalizers seems to be a promising solution. In this section,
a modularized global equalization structure (shown in Figure
4) is proposed below.
A. Structure
(a) The battery pack deﬁned by assumptions (i)-(iv) is parti-
tioned into M modules, m
1
,m
2
,...,m
M
. Each module
contains N battery cells equally.
(b) In each module m
i
, there is one single global equalizer
e
i
that can take up the SOC of all the cells within the
module and transfer energy from the cell with the largest
SOC to the smallest, i = 1,...,M.
(c) Another global equalizer e
M+1
equalizes modules in the
similar manner as cells. If the average SOC in module
m
k
is larger than module m
j
, the global equalizer e
M+1
will take r
M+1
/N units of energy from each cell in m
k
andsendthesameamounttoeachcellinm
j
.Theenergy
loss will also be evenly divided among cells in module
m
k
.
The global equalizer needs to be “intelligent”, since it
is required to select two cells to equalize among all the
connected cells by sorting their SOCs. In addition, as shown
in Figure 4, the number of equalizers is (M +1), which is
determined by the number of modules. Since each module
typically contains a certain amount of battery cells, we could
argue that M is substantially smaller than the total number
of cells B. For example, for a 64-cell battery pack with 4

modules, only 5 rather than 63 equalizers are needed for
the modularized global equalization system. In this sense,
theproposed modularized globalequalization structure could
tremendouslyreducethenumberofequalizersinvolvedinthe
system.
B. Mathematical Model
Denote x
i
(0) as the initial SOC and x
i
(n) as the SOC at
time n for each cell b
i
, i = 1,...,B, n = 1,2,.... Then
the system dynamics could be captured by the following
mathematical model, which implies that the current SOC
of a speciﬁc battery cell depends on its SOC of previous
time slot, the charging/discharging operation and equalizing
dynamics.

C. Performance Evaluation
To evaluate the equalization time and the average SOC
when the system reaches equilibrium, we assume that
1683
no energy loss is involved in equalization, and charg-
ing/discharging rate and equalization rate are identical for
all the cells and equalizers, respectively, i.e.,
l
i
= 0, i = 1,...,M +1, (2)
r

d

Consider the structure shown in Figure 4, the equalization
procedure essentially consists of two steps: intra-module and
inter-module. Speciﬁcally, in the inter-module level, charges
are extracted and distributed evenly among the cells within
the module. Hence, the inter-module equalization will not
affect the equilibrium of the intra-module level. In addition,
the charging and discharging for each cell are also identical.
Therefore, the equilibrium SOC for each module x
i
could
be estimated using the initial SOC within the module, i.e.,
x
i
=
1
N
∑
j?mi
x
j
(0), i = 1,...,M. (6)
Then the equalization time for each module T

could be
obtained as follows:
T

=
∑
j?mi
|x

(0)?x

2r
, i = 1,...,M. (7)
In the inter-module equalization, the equilibrium SOC for
all modules X can be characterized as
X =
1
M
M
∑
i=1
x

. (8)
Then the equalization time for equalizer e
M+1
could be
calculated similarly:
T
M+1
=
∑
M
i=1
|x
i
?X|
2r
. (9)
Since all equalizers function independently, the largest
value of T
i
, i = 1,...,M +1, determines equalization time
T
eq
. Similarly, the equalized SOC S
eq
could be obtained
by combining the overall equilibrium SOC and the charg-
ing/discharging effect.
Theorem 1: Under conditions (2)-(5), the performance
of modularized global equalizer described in (a)-(c) could be
expressed as follows
T
eq
= max
i?{1;:::;M+1}
{T
i
},
S
eq
= X +cT
eq
?dT
eq
,
where T
i
and X are calculated from (6)-(9).
Theabovetheoremillustratesthefactthatthemodularized
global equalizer guarantees that the system reaches equilib-
rium within a ﬁnite period of time. In addition, T
eq
highly
depends on the initial SOC pattern and exhibits negative
correlation with equalization rate.
When conditions (2)-(5) are relaxed, the system dynamics
become sophisticated and analytical expressions on T
eq
and
S
eq
seem impossible to obtain. Nevertheless, the diversity of
charging/discharging rate and equalizers and the involvement
of energy loss could merely affect the system quantitatively,
rather than qualitatively. Therefore, the argument that the
system reaches equilibrium within ﬁnite period of time still
holds.
IV. COMPARISON WITH STATE-OF-THE-ART
EQUALIZATION STRUCTURES
In order to demonstrate the performance of the modular-
ized global equalization, simulation studies are carried out
in comparison with serial, module and layer equalization
structures.Toconductnumericalexperiments,theinitialSOC
of cell b
i
, i = 1,...,B, is generated randomly and indepen-
dently from the uniform distribution U(0,1). In practice, all
equalizers are typically designed to be identical. Thus we
assume all equalization rate r
i
to be 0.001 and energy loss
rate l
i
is equal to 0.00001. Moreover, to emulate the charg-
ing/discharging dynamics, charging rate c
i
and discharging
rate d
i
for cell b
i
are selected randomly and independently
according to uniform distribution U(0.0001,0.001).
With the same system parameter settings, comparative
studies with respect to the key performance, equalization
time T
eq
and equalized SOC S
eq
, are investigated for four
types of equalization structures. Note that strict equilibrium
may not be reached due to the sensitivity of equalizers.
Therefore, a tolerance factor ? is introduced and set to be
0.02, i.e., ? = 0.02. When the absolute difference of the
maximum and minimum of SOCs for all the cells falls below
?, equilibrium is deemed to be attained. The simulation starts
from the simplest case where the battery pack consists of 8
cells, and then scales up to 16 cells and 64 cells.
A. 8 Cells with 2 Modules
First consider a 8-cell battery pack with 2 modules. To
illustrate the system performance in different application
scenarios, the simulation function is divided into four cases:
equalization without charge/discharge or energy loss, during
charging, with energy loss only, and with charging and
energy loss.
1) Equalization without charge/discharge or energy loss:
Simulation in this scenario simply tests the equalization
speed for serial, module, layer and global structures, since
there is no additive or dissipative energy involved once
initial SOCs are determined. With the initial SOC randomly
generated, the equalization processes for four types of struc-
tures are illustrated in Figure 6. Clearly, serial, layer and
module structures exhibit similar equalization speed, while
equalization time for the proposed global structure is slightly
longer.
2) Equalization during charging: To compare the equal-
ization performance during charging, random charging rate
will be assigned to each cell after their initial SOCs are

all four structures. Moreover, the differences for their T

are negligible. Since discharging is the reverse
process of charging, similar performance could be obtained
for discharging analogously.

3) Equalization with energy loss: Energy loss associated
with equalization is inevitable in physical systems. There-
fore, in this scenario, equalizers are regarded as dissipative
sources, with its energy loss rate ﬁxed for each equalization
cycle. The simulation results are described in Figure 8. In
terms of equalization speed, the global equalizer is almost
identical with module and layer structures, but dramatically
faster than the serial one. Meanwhile, S
eq
of the global
equalization turns out to be the largest among the four
structures,sinceitinvolvesthesmallestnumberofequalizers
(only 3 for global equalization and 7 for the other three
structures in this case) and its energy loss is signiﬁcantly
reduced accordingly.

ing scenarios 2) and 3) results in a common situation that

From the previous case, equilibrium has been demon-
strated to be achieved for all four structures regardless of
charging/discharging and energy loss. Therefore, for the rest
of the simulation, only scenario 3), equalization with energy
loss, is utilized to illustrate the comparative performance as
the pack size increases.
In a 16-cell battery pack with 4 modules, similar sim-
ulation is carried out and results are shown in Figure 10.
The serial equalization takes relative longer time to achieve
equilibrium, while minimal difference in the equalization
time T
eq
could be observed for the other three equalization
structures. As for the equalized SOC, S
eq
is equal to 0.581
1685
for the global equalizer, and 0.576, 0.551, and 0.556 for
serial, module, and layer equalizers, respectively. As one can
see, the global equalizer outperforms the others by 1%-5%
on energy saving in this case.

C. 64 Cells with 8 Modules
When the battery pack size increases to 64 cells with
8 modules, the serial equalization fails to converge. Com-
paring the global equalizer with module and layer ones,
similar as the previous case, T
eq
remains comparable among
them as the battery pack scales up (shown in Figure 11).
However, according to a simple calculation with respect to
S
eq
, the energy loss for the global equalizer is saved by
approximately 10% and 16% compared to layer and module
equalizer, respectively. Furthermore, it is worth to mention
thatequilibriummeansthatthedifferenceofSOCisminimal
(falls within the tolerance ?), rather than zero. In this sense,
the equalization process will still continue when equilibrium
is reached, which results in more energy waste. As one can
see, the aforementioned energy loss is signiﬁcant in module
and layer equalization, while only a relatively small amount
for serial and global equalization. Also note that global
equalization only uses 9 equalizers while the other three all
use 63 equalizers, which is 7 times more.
D. Discussions
The above simulation study provides a holistic view of
equalization dynamics in different scenarios for four types
of equalization structures. In general, our proposed modular-
ized global equalization structure, compared with the other
three state-of-the-art structures, takes similar time to reach
equilibrium. As the size of the battery pack increases, T
eq
is
also getting larger. Nevertheless, a much smaller number of
equalizers used in global equalization induces considerable
reduction on both the cost of the system and energy loss
during the equalization process. The energy saving of global
equalization becomes more signiﬁcant as the battery pack

V. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, a modularized global equalization method is
introduced to balance the SOC of battery cells. In addition to
developingmathematicalmodeltoemulatesystemdynamics,
analytical formulas are derived to evaluate equalization per-
formance. Finally a comparative simulation study with the
state-of-the-art equalization methods is carried out in terms
of equalization speed and energy loss. Simulation results
show that the proposed global equalization takes comparable
time to reach equilibrium as the serial, layer and module
equalizations, while its energy loss during equalization is the
minimum. Moreover, the number of equalizers is reduced
substantially. Therefore, the global equalization could ﬁnd
itself promising in applications where rigorous restrictions
are imposed on cost and energy loss.
