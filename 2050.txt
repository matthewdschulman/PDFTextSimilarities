Abstract— In this paper, an optimization method for design-
ing MR clutches is studied. The proposed method optimizes
the geometrical dimensions of an MR clutch, hence its mass,
for given output torque and electrical input power. The main
idea behind this optimization is that the input power and
output torque are two parameters that are normally known
to the designer prior to the design of an MR clutch and
considering these parameters in the optimization as ﬁxed values
has a practical signiﬁcance. Having presented the optimization
method, we compare the characteristics of three different MR
clutch conﬁgurations in order to demonstrate the effectiveness
of the proposed method. A comparison between the drum,
single-disk and multi-disk conﬁgurations of MR clutches is
performed. Using the proposed method one can select a suitable
conﬁguration as well as the geometrical dimensions for an MR
clutch that best suits the requirements of each individual design.
I. INTRODUCTION
Magneto-Rheological (MR) ﬂuids, carrying micrometer-
scale particles, are a kind of smart material whose viscosity
can be changed fast and reversibly using an external magnetic
ﬁeld. This property of MR ﬂuids allows to accurately control
the shear stress of the ﬂuid by controlling the intensity of an
external magnetic ﬁeld [1]. As a result, MR ﬂuids devices
such as dampers, brakes and clutches have increasingly
attracted attentions for various applications in recent years.
Regardless of their applications, MR ﬂuid devices hold great
potentials in commercial ﬁeld.
To this effect, a wide range of studies have been proposed
within the context of designing good MR devices. The
response time of an MR damper is discussed in [2] and the
study shows that the response time decreases as the applied
current or piston velocity increases. Using the results in
[3], the geometrical parameters of a drum-type MR brake
including the thickness of MR ﬂuids can be calculated
theoretically. After studying the inﬂuence of the material
and the air gap in an MR clutch, Xu and Zeng proposed
a design of an MR clutch for controlling the fan speed of
an engine in a cooling system [4]. In order to achieve large
output torque, Kwan, et al., proposed a new approach to
build an MR brake by using small steel rollers as over-sized
magnetic particles [5]. Recently, Finite Element Analysis
(FEA) and optimization have been increasingly employed to

design MR devices. A rotary MR brake was designed in [6]
for a prosthetic knee optimized for maximum output torque
and minimum off-state torque. The number of turns for a
electromagnetic coil inside an MR brake was optimized in
[7]. Multi objectives optimization techniques were employed
in [8], [9], in order to design an MR brake with large output
torque and small weight. The geometrical parameters of a
disk-type MR brake were optimized in [10]. The objective
of the optimization was to maximize the output torque of
an MR brake which was constrained with a certain space.
Achieving maximum magnetic ﬂux density on MR ﬂuids
was selected as the objective of the optimization in [11].
A T-shape MR brake that used magnetic ﬁeld in the axis
and radius directions was proposed in [12]. The geometrical
parameters of this brake were optimized considering the
output torque, the mass of the brake, and the temperature
caused by friction.
In our previous body of work, we developed a new ac-
tuation mechanism known as Distributed Active Semi-active
Actuator (DASA) using MR clutches [13]. DASA is a novel
actuation concept that emphasizes on safe actuation without
compromising the performance for Human-Compatible and
Human-Friendly robots. The details and advantages of DASA
have been reported in [14]–[16]. Unlike the design of MR
devices mentioned above, achieving as large output torque
as possible in designing MR clutches is not the primary
concern. A larger output torque in an MR clutch may lead to
more power consumption or lower control resolution which
are not desired for human-safe robots. Thus, employing the
optimization methods discussed in the aforementioned papers
do not provide the most suitable solution in the case of
designing an MR clutch. The concept of using an MR clutch
in an actuator is presented in Fig. 1. As shown, the output
torque of an MR clutch can be controlled using two inputs,
namely the input current and the input mechanical power.
In practice, the input mechanical power is often kept as a
constant and an MR clutch is mainly controlled using the
input current. The value of the input current is determined
by the resistance of the coil inside the MR clutch and the
electrical components outside the MR clutch. The resistance
of coil is dependent on the dimensions of the coil which can
be optimized. Yet, the electrical components are normally
determined prior to designing the MR clutch.
The main contribution of this paper is to propose an
optimization method for designing MR clutches. In this
optimization, the input electrical power of the MR clutch is
considered as a ﬁxed value and the geometrical dimensions
of the clutch are optimized so as to make the MR clutch

generate a certain output torque with the least possible mass.
As mentioned above, the input electrical power and the
output torque are commonly known before designing an MR
clutch, hence considering them as ﬁxed values during the
optimization is a practical approach. This allows to change
the values of the input power and the output torque based
on the requirements of the problem so as to obtain the best
conﬁgurations and geometrical dimensions.
In this paper, we ﬁrst compare three different MR clutch
conﬁgurations, i.e., drum, single-disk, and multi-disk clutch-
es with no constraints on the input current and output
torque. While similar comparisons for MR brakes have been
discussed in [17], [18], such comparisons are not directly
applicable to MR clutches as explained previously. To the
best of our knowledge, there is no reported study that
draw a comparison between the characteristics of different
MR clutch conﬁgurations. Having discussed the optimization
method, we compare the characteristics of different MR
clutch conﬁgurations for the case of constant input power and
output torque. Using this method allows for the selection of
a suitable conﬁguration as well as geometrical dimensions
for an MR clutch that best suits the requirements of each
individual design.
II. MR CLUTCH
As known, with the effect of an external magnetic ﬁeld, the
particles within MR ﬂuids join into columns aligned in the
direction of the ﬁeld. These columns can resist the shearing
of the ﬂuid perpendicular to the ﬁeld. MR clutches are
employed as a means of materializing this concept through
bounding the amount of transmitted torque based on the in-
tensity of an applied magnetic ﬁeld. An MR clutch generally
consists of input and output mechanical components, the MR
ﬂuids which ﬁll the volume between the input and output
components, and one or multiple electromagnetic coils used
for generating a magnetic ﬁeld. An MR clutch provides two
inputs for control the out of the clutch. One input is a rather
constant mechanical power provided, for example, by an
electric motor. This input introduces shearing between input
and output mechanisms. The other input is the current into
the electromagnetic coils to generate a magnetic ﬁeld. With
this magnetic ﬁeld, the shear stress of the MR ﬂuids would
be altered, which allows the MR clutch to transmit the input
power to the output as a function of shearing between input
and output components.
A. Drum MR clutch
A drum-type MR clutch is one of the earliest proposed
conﬁgurations. This conﬁguration is often used to demon-
strate the design of MR devices [19]. Fig. 2 demonstrates the
cross section of a typical drum-type MR clutch. The output
part includes an output shaft and an electromagnetic coil. The
input part is a hollow cylindrical casing which surrounds the
output part. The volume between the input and output parts
is ﬁlled with MR ﬂuids. Both output shaft and input parts are
made of ferromagnetic materials in order to form a magnetic
circuit path inside the MR clutch.

The Bingham visco-plastic model is a good candidate to
represent the shear stress of the MR ﬂuids as a function of
the applied ﬁeld and shear rate [20]–[24]. According to the
Bingham model, the shear stress can be presented as:
 =
y
(H)+
dv
dz
;  >
y
(1)
where  is the shear stress, 
y
is the ﬁeld dependent yield
stress, H is the applied magnetic ﬁeld intensity,  is the
Newtonian viscosity, and
dv
dz
is the velocity gradient in the
direction of the ﬁeld. Applying the Bingham model to the
MR clutch in Fig. 2, results in the following new model:
 =
y
(H)+_ (!;r;g);  >
y
(2)
where the shear rate _  is deﬁned as
_  =
!r
g
(3)
in that ! is the angular velocity between input and output
parts, r is the radius from the rotational axis, and g is the
thickness of ﬂuid-ﬁlled gap between input and output parts.
It is interesting to note that the ﬁrst term on the right-hand
side of (2) is only related to the electrical input while the
second term is only related to the mechanical input to the
MR clutch. In other words, the input current can only affect
the output torque via the ﬁeld dependent yield stress, i.e.,
y
.
In an MR clutch, the output torque can be presented as
dT =rdA (4)
where r is the radius from the rotational axis, is the shear
stress of the MR ﬂuids, andA is the area of active MR ﬂuids
inside the clutch. Substituting (2) into (4) and integrating
across the MR ﬂuids area for a drum-type clutch (shown the
Fig. 2), we can obtain the output torque of the clutch as,

It should be noted that in this output torque, the viscosity of
the carrier ﬂuid  is typically within a range of 0.1 to 0.3
Pa-s and ! approaches zero as the MR ﬂuids become more
solidiﬁed. On the other hand, the contribution of 
y
(H) to
the output torque is within a range of kPa-s torque for typical
MR ﬂuids. Thus, it is reasonable to ignore the second term in
(5) due to its negligible effect on the estimated value of the
output torque. As a result, the output torque of a drum-type
MR clutch can be approximately rewritten as,

As mentioned earlier, the only parameter affecting

is the electrical current input. Given that the mechanical input
to an MR clutch is often a constant value, one can deﬁne the
dynamic range of an MR clutchDR with respect to its input
current as,

MR clutch. The nominator of (7) represents the maximum
output torque that the MR clutch can generate while the
dominator is the output torque that the MR clutch can
generate with zero input current applied. According to (7),
the dynamic range of a drum-type MR clutch can be obtained
as,

B. Single-Disk MR clutch
The disk-type, including single-disk and multi-disk MR
clutch is the most common conﬁguration due to its good
performance. This conﬁguration has been employed for
commercial purposes. A number of studies on disk-type MR
devices, including MR clutches, can be found in the literature
where incremental modiﬁcations on this conﬁguration have
been proposed and exercised. In this paper, we consider a
typical disk-type MR clutch only, for the purpose of our
study.
Fig. 3 shows the cross-section of a single-disk MR clutch.
Similar to a drum-type MR clutch, the output part of a
single-disk MR clutch also serves as the output shaft. An
electromagnetic coil is mounted on the shaft. Additionally,
there is a single thin output disk mounted on the output shaft.
The input part encloses the output parts, and the volume
between the input and the output parts is ﬁlled with MR
ﬂuids. In this conﬁguration, the magnetic ﬁeld generated by
the coil along the output shaft axis crosses the MR ﬂuids
perpendicularly. Providing the mechanical input to rotate the
input part of a signal-disk MR clutch introduces shearing
on both sides of the output disk when the coil is activated,
thereby resulting in an output torque on the shaft. Using (2)
and (4), the output torque of a single-disk MR clutch can be
obtained in a similar way as before as,

previously. Under the same assumptions made in the case
of a drum-type clutch, the major contribution to the output

is the maximum shear stress that the MR ﬂuids
can achieve in a single-disk MR clutch.
C. Multi-Disk MR clutch
In order to achieve a considerable torque capacity, multi-
disk MR clutches can be used to increase the active areas of
the MR ﬂuids. Each individual disk inside a multi-disk MR
clutch can provide two sides of the disk as the active areas
and withN output disks, the active areas inside a multi-disk
MR clutch can be expanded up to 2N times larger than the
active area of a single-disk MR clutch. Assuming N output
disks, the output torque and the dynamic range of a multi-
disk clutch can be derived from those for a single-disk MR
clutch as,

in that all parameters are as deﬁned previously. As expected,
the output torque of anN-disk MR clutch isN times larger
than the output torque of a single-disk MR clutch with
similar dimensions. However, given that the zero-current
output torque of anN-disk MR clutch is also increased by a
factor ofN, anN-disk MR clutch enjoys the same dynamic
range as a single-disk MR clutch.
In this section, the output torque of drum, single-disk, and
multi-disk type MR clutches were obtained using Bingham
model. The dynamic range of each conﬁguration were also
obtained and compared. While using these results it is
5052
possible to directly compare different conﬁgurations for their
achievable torques, to draw a more inclusive comparison,
other parameters such as mass, volume, coil size, etc. need
to be considered. This will be the subject of the following
sections.
III. DESIGN OPTIMIZATION
The three mentioned conﬁgurations are optimized in this
section, so as to accommodate a fair comparison between
different MR clutch conﬁgurations. The characteristics con-
sidered in this body of work include weight, current capacity,
and moment of inertia, all of which are functions of the
geometrical parameters for a given conﬁguration. The well-
known Finite Element Method (FEM) was hired to estimate
the magnetic ﬁeld and calculate the characteristics for each
conﬁguration, using COMSOL Multiphysics software.
A. Material Selection
Before proceeding with the analysis, it is essential to
specify the materials considered for each component of an
MR clutch, such as the materials for the shaft, disks, casing,
and coil. Copper was selected for the coil, imitating the
characteristics of typical wires for coiling. It can be argued
that using non-magnetic materials is important for outer
casing of a disk-type MR clutch to reduce the magnetic ﬁeld
leakage and make magnetic ﬂux perpendicular to the internal
disks. To this effect, Aluminum was chosen among other
non-magnetic materials. AISI steel 1018 was considered for
magnetic circuits inside MR clutches forming magnetic ﬂux.
The ferromagnetic components of disk-type conﬁgurations
are shaft, disks, and inner casing, while they are drum and
shaft, in the drum conﬁguration. Lastly, MRF-140CG ﬂuid
was selected as the MR ﬂuid inside the clutch.
B. Optimal design of MR clutches

following objective function is proposed,

a
is the predicted output
torque of the clutch, M is the mass, and J
D
is the current
density applied to the coil. The rational behind selecting this
objective function is to minimize the clutch weight, yet being
capable of providing the desired torque. Optimizing MR
clutches weights are important in employment of them as part
of robots actuations. Obviously, the objective function results
in the maximum torque-to-mass ratio, for a given desired
torque. A practical limitation, the temperature tolerance of
copper wires for coil, is considered in the proposed objective
function. The maximum allowable current density for copper
wires is2:5A=mm

pertinent to their temperature tolerances
[25].
In order to ﬁnd solutions for the optimization problem
deﬁned in (14), the coil current density is required. The cross
section of a coil in MR clutches is depicted in Fig. 4. To

IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
Optimal designs of single-disk, multi-disk, and drum based
MR clutch conﬁgurations are presented in this section. To
obtain optimal design for each conﬁguration, the objective
function given in (14) is considered. To make different
conﬁgurations comparable, we considered the situation when
the desired output toque and the available electrical power
for all conﬁgurations are identical. Accordingly, P
r
was set
as 2W and the desired torque T
r
was considered as 20Nm.
Further, the weighting coefﬁcients W
1
and W
2
in (14) were
set as 0.7 and 0.3, respectively. Since our primary goal is to
obtain clutch parameters under which the clutch can provide
the desired torque, more weight was put on the torque term
in the objective function compared to the clutch mass.

Due to the fact that drum and disk-based conﬁgurations d-
iffer topologically, different optimization variables should be
considered. Table I lists the optimization variables for drum
conﬁguration, while the optimization variables for disk-type
conﬁgurations are listed in Table II. Due to manufacturing
and implementation considerations, the thickness of disk and
the size of MR ﬂuids gaps were ﬁxed to 1mm and 0.5mm
in both disk-type conﬁgurations. Figs. 5 and 6 display the
magnetic ﬂux density, respectively, in drum and single-disk
conﬁgurations. In this study, a 3-output-disk MR clutch is
selected as an example of multi-disk conﬁguration.

A. Analysis Results
The optimization results for drum, single-disk and 3-disk
MR clutch conﬁgurations are given in Table III. The output
torques reported in Table III were calculated based on the
Bingham model. As observed, the output torque estimated
for all conﬁgurations are close to the desired torque, i.e.
T
r
= 20 Nm. Moreover, considering the optimized volume
and mass of each conﬁguration, disk-type MR clutches offers
smaller volume and mass comparing with the drum conﬁgu-
ration. The maximum current density is obtained for single-
disk conﬁguration, indicating that this conﬁguration requires
electrical components with higher current capacity compared
to the other conﬁgurations. As an important result, the 3-
disk MR clutch features the lowest moment of inertia, while
the moment of inertia is signiﬁcantly higher in drum and
single-disk conﬁgurations. This is because the optimization
for drum and single-disk conﬁgurations resulted in heavier
components for drum-type and larger radius components
for single-disk. Furthermore, assuming the relative velocity
between input and output shafts is 1 rad=s, zero-current-
applied output torques were calculated. As can be seen, the
calculated torques are insigniﬁcant for all conﬁgurations,
while the drum conﬁguration gives the smallest value. As an
additional design consideration, H-R ratio is deﬁned, where
H and R stand for the height and radius of the resultant
MR clutches. In this respect, the drum conﬁguration features
relatively large H-R value, which makes it more suitable for
applications requiring small radius clutch, while the height
might not be an issue.

MR ﬂuid gap sizes can be considered as another de-
sign consideration speciﬁcally for multi-disk conﬁguration.
Theoretically, increasing/dreasing the gap sizes results in
dramatically increasing/descresing of total reluctance of the
magnetic circuit. To observe this effect, the geometrical
dimensions of 3-disk MR clutch were optimized considering
different ﬂuid gap sizes. The MR ﬂuids gaps for this purpose
were chosen as 0.1 mm, 0.5 mm and 0.9 mm respectively.
The resultant characteristics for each case are given in Table

As observed, smaller ﬂuid gap size offers lighter and more
compact clutch. On the contrary, the MR clutches with small-
er gaps require higher input currents. In practice, it is difﬁcult
to achieve very small ﬂuids gaps. The main challenges arises
when MR ﬂuid needs to be injected through the ﬂuid gaps.
In summary, Table V concludes the characteristics of drum,
single-disk and multi-disk MR clutches.

It can be seen that among these three conﬁgurations,
the drum conﬁguration possesses less compactness, heavier
design, and larger output moment of inertia compared to oth-
er conﬁgurations. However, the drum conﬁguration features
the smallest zero-current-applied output torque as well as
relatively large H-R ratio. Another advantage of drum conﬁg-
uration is the manufacturing of drum-based clutches is easier
in general compared to multi-disk conﬁgurations. The single-
disk conﬁguration demonstrates middle level characteristics
among conﬁgurations. The main issue with using single-disk
clutches is that they may possess a very large radius, con-
straining their application in speciﬁc environments. They also
require the electrical component with larger current capacity.
The multi-disk conﬁguration exhibits the best characteristics
considering compactness, weight, and moment of inertia.
Their H-R ratios are also larger comparing to single-disk
conﬁguration, making them an alternative option for tasks
requiring higher compactness. Careful attention should be
paid however designing MR clutches with high number of
disks. Characteristics of MR clutches can dramatically affect-
ed by increasing the number of disks, hence the number of
ﬂuid gaps. Also, increasing number of disks would result in
more complicated assembling. Moreover, the ﬂuid gap sizes
can alter characteristics of multi-disk clutches, as increasing
gap sizes will result in reduction in magnetic ﬁeld and output
torques in MR clutches.
V. CONCLUSION
In this paper, an optimized design for MR clutches was
presented aiming at minimizing the clutch mass for a desired
torque. To this intent, several conﬁgurations were considered
for MR clutches, including drum, single-disk, and multi-disk
arrangements. A new objective function was proposed for
optimizing the MR clutch parameters. As an important aspect
of the new objective function, the physical limitations on the
available electrical power and the temperature tolerances of
coil wire were considered as well in the design optimization.
Thorough analysis were performed to discuss characteristics
of each conﬁguration obtained by optimization. Advantages
and disadvantages of each conﬁguration were highlighted.
In addition, sensitivities of the characteristics to variation
of ﬂuid gap sizes were analysed speciﬁcally for multi-disk
clutches. The analysis provided in this paper could be used
in selecting proper conﬁguration for an MR clutch and
optimizing MR actuators for robots.
