Abstract—Landing of unmanned helicopters is a challenging
maneuver which can be seriously affected by GPS sensor
reliability. This work explores an alternative approach to GPS
sensors to avoid typical drawbacks, such as inaccuracies of
standalone sensors or weight/cost for Real Time Kinematic
(RTK) setups. To this end, the paper studies a setup consisting of
a tether linking the helicopter to the landing point. Appropriate
sensing of tether attitude relative to the helicopter together with
an altitude measurement, allows estimation of the helicopter’s
linear position relative to the landing point. Additionally, the
tension exerted on the tether provides a stabilizing effect on
helicopter translational dynamics. Taking into account all these
considerations, a model-based control strategy is developed and
implemented in the real platform. The experimental results
endorse the validity of the proposed approach.
Keywords—Unmanned aerial systems, tethered helicopter,

I. INTRODUCTION
When comparing different Unmanned Aerial Vehicle
(UAV) conﬁgurations, helicopters and other rotor-based air-
craft have capabilities such as hovering and vertical take-
off and landing that cannot be achieved by conventional
ﬁxed-wing aircraft. These features allow remotely piloted
and autonomous helicopters to be used extensively nowadays
for applications such as inspection, accurate measurement
and other aerial robotic applications. However, hovering
and landing performance can be seriously affected by wind
disturbances or sensor failures.
This paper presents a tethered setup that improves sys-
tem operation under such difﬁculties. This augmented setup
consists of a tether linking the helicopter to the landing
point. The application of tension on the tether at all times
is a crucial feature for system operation. In order to address
the sensor reliability issue, the often problematic GPS mea-
surement is replaced in this work by an alternative linear
position estimation relative to tether’s ﬁxed point at ground,
based on helicopter altitude and tether attitude relative to
the airframe. This sensing approach makes the system more
robust since it will work even when GPS is jammed, and

provides sufﬁcient information for a tether-guided landing.
An additional beneﬁt of tether use is that tension exerted
provides robustness against external disturbances.
To the best of the authors’ knowledge, the tether-based
estimate for replacing GPS sensors in landing is really a
new line of research since no references can be found in the
existing literature. In the application scenario of landing a
helicopter using a tether as an additional control resource,
the only contributions are those of [1], [2]. Concerning
performance degradation under wind disturbance, the use of
tether tension to increase hovering maneuver stability was
also almost unexplored before the authors’ ﬁrst contributions
[3], [4]. The only related precedents that consider a tethered
conﬁguration for rotorcraft prototypes are those of [5], where
the linearized equations describing the perturbed longitudinal
motion of a tethered rotorcraft are presented and [6], where
a discussion of control and stability problems involved in
the tethered conﬁguration for a rotor platform prototype is
presented, with special emphasis on tether dynamics.
This paper is organized as follows. Section II presents
the dynamic model corresponding to the augmented system
(small-size helicopter and tether) as well as subsequent
analysis to underline the beneﬁts of the tethered conﬁguration
in stabilizing translational dynamics. The helicopter control
approach together with the novel methodology based on
the tethered setup for estimating linear position relative to
the landing point, are presented in Section III. In Section
IV, the experimental setup is described in detail, and the
data gathered in the ﬁeld is discussed. Finally, Section V is
devoted to conclusions and future work.
II. SYSTEM MODELING AND ANALYSIS
This section presents the resulting model for the tethered
conﬁguration (see Fig. 1). A more detailed derivation follow-
ing Kane’s methodology [7] can be found in previous works
of the authors [8]. The section ends with an analysis of the
potentials of the tethered setup.
A. Helicopter model
Dynamics of a small-size helicopter with a stiff main rotor
are mainly described by a mechanical model. Attempts to
include an elaborate aerodynamic model of the main rotor
in controller design do not show signiﬁcant improvements
in performance during control experiments. This could be
considered evidence for the fact that the approach to analyz-
ing helicopter behavior by means of a mechanical model is
suitable for practical applications [9].
The mechanical characterization of the helicopter accounts
for two separate rigid bodies, fuselage F (with mass m

for most commercially available small-size helicopters, the
inertial effects of the main rotor (gyroscopic effect) become
the main component inﬂuencing the rotational dynamics of
the whole mechanical system, whilst the tail rotor inertial

Since only the mechanical model is used for modeling
analysis and subsequent derivation of the controller, as
aforesaid, the forces and moments exerted on the system
will be considered as system inputs for control design. More
precisely, the subset of these forces and moments whose
values can be ﬁxed independently of each other by the
controller, is given by f
MR,3
, t
MR,1
, t
MR,2
and f
TR,2
.In
the implementation of the controller, these inputs are trans-
formed to servo positions using simple linear functions with
only three unknown constants: the ﬁrst constant describes
the relation between the main rotor collective pitch and
lifting forcef
MR,3
; the second, the relation between the main
rotor cyclic pitches and moments t
MR,1
and t
MR,2
, and the
third the relation between the tail rotor collective pitch and
force f
TR,2
. These constants are identiﬁed experimentally.
This approach to linear characterization of aerodynamics has
already been veriﬁed successfully in [9].
B. Tethered helicopter model
When accounting for the tether effect on the model, it is
assumed for the sake of simplicity that the tether end at the
ground coincides with the origin of inertial frame N.Atthe
other end, the tether is connected to the helicopter at point
P
H
as depicted in Fig. 1. For this conﬁguration,the resulting
dynamic model is more manageable when helicopter position
in inertial frame N is deﬁned by means of the generalized
coordinates q
7,8,9
(t). As can be seen in Fig. 2, the device
ﬁxing the tether to the helicopter is a universal joint, denoted
by frame C. Therefore, angular variables q
7,8
(t) correspond
to two successive rotations at point P
H
that align vector f
3
of the fuselage frame with the tether line deﬁned by vector
c
3
. The remaining conﬁguration coordinate q
9
(t) deﬁnes the
instantaneous tether length, as shown in Fig. 1. Hence, the
position of point P

is given by:

while maintaining Cartesian motion variables u

is given
by the resulting dynamic differential equations, much more
compact for the tethered conﬁguration than those correspond-
ing to Cartesian coordinates for both conﬁguration (q

C. Analysis of tether inﬂuence in system dynamics
When analyzing the equations (3) and (4) corresponding
to helicopter dynamics in free ﬂight, it is clear that rotational
dynamics are not coupled with translational dynamics, which
means the relationship between rotational and translational
dynamics can be expressed as a unidirectional inﬂuence
rotation ? translation. In contrast, in the dynamic equations
of the tethered conﬁguration given by (9) and (10) there is
an additional force acting on the helicopter due to tether
tension which produces in turn a moment affecting rotational
dynamics, since the application point of the force does not
exactly correspond with the helicopter’s center of mass. This
moment depends on both the helicopter’s translational mo-
tion and orientation. Thus, the relationship between rotational
and translational dynamics is now more complex, given a
bidirectional inﬂuence rotation ? translation.
Following the analysis of (9) and (10), it can be concluded
that the tether effect on the system is twofold. On the one
hand, upon examination of translational dynamics, it is clear
that the tether tension provides robustness against external
disturbances such as lateral and longitudinal wind forces,
since the projection of this force on the horizontal plane is
always opposite to the direction of the resultant disturbance
force. On the other hand, the moment induced by the existing
offset between the tether tension application point P
H
and
center of mass H
O
, produces undesired coupling between
rotational and translational dynamics, which makes it more
difﬁcult to control the system. It is important to note that the
value of the moment caused by the tether could be similar to
or greater than the moments required to control the rotation
of the helicopter in free ﬂight without a tethering device.
Therefore, although it is true that high values of tether
tension would reinforce stabilizing action in translational
dynamics, it should also be taken into account that the
higher this value is, the higher the control degradation for
helicopter rotational dynamics may be. A trade-off criterion
suggests that the maximum value of tether tension for system
operation should be deﬁned in such a way that the induced
tether moment is always less than the maximum moment
exerted by the main rotor control action, corresponding to
cyclic pitch saturation.
III. HELICOPTER CONTROL
The control structure adopted for the tethered system is
based on the control scheme for the free helicopter presented
in [9] (see Fig. 3). The gray blocks denote helicopter
dynamics, whilst the white blocks denote the controller itself.

Fig. 3: General scheme for helicopter control
The underlying approach is based on linearization through
model inversions and PID control laws. The main idea is to
adjust the orientation of the main rotor plane, and therefore
of the lifting force, in order to generate the translational
accelerations required to reduce position error. The inputs for
the control scheme are given by the desired position q
?
1,2,3
and the desired yaw angle q
?
6
.
As can be seen in Fig. 3, the complete scheme consists
of three control loops. The outer loop controller C
TRAS
calculates from error between measured and desired position
the required translational accelerations ˙ u
?
1,2,3
to reduce such
deviations, and this is implemented by means of a PI-D con-
trol law. These accelerations are converted into the desired
orientation for the main rotor plane q
?
4,5
, and the desired
lifting force f
MR,3
, through the inversion of translational
dynamics in block D
?1
123
. For the purpose of this inversion,
input f
TR,2
is considered a disturbance and hence ignored
(f
MR,3
is about one order of magnitude greater than f
TR,2
).

are calculated from error
between estimated Euler angles through Inertial Measure-
ment Unit (IMU) data and the desired values ˙ q

using a
Proportional Gain. These Euler angle derivatives are then
converted into the desired angular speeds u
?

in block K

by means of the inversion of rotational kinematics given by
(2). Then, desired angular accelerations ˙ u

are calculated
from deviations between measured angular speed and the

using another Proportional Gain. The
resulting angular accelerations are converted into moments
t
MR,1
andt
MR,2
by the corresponding inversion of rotational
dynamics in block D

456
. Again considering f
TR,2

Finally, the desired yaw angle q

is controlled separately
with the third loop controller C
TAIL
. For this purpose,
desired angular speed u
?
6
is calculated from error between
estimated yaw angle through IMU measurements and the
desired value q
?
6
using a PI control law. Tail rotor force f
TR,2
is then calculated from error between measured angular
speed and the desired value u
?
6
using a Proportional Gain.
In order to tune the controller parameters, a classic pole
assignment method is used for the system resulting from
the linearization though model inversion. An analysis of
the mechanical limitations of the system by means of ex-
periments providing step inputs suggests that the closed-
loop poles should be set around -1 for translational and
rotational dynamics, and one order of magnitude greater for
tail rotor dynamics. This is a trade-off value that guarantees
a proper dynamic range, while the mechanical limitations of
the system are not overreached.
A. Controller extension for tether-guided landing
In order use the tether as a guiding element while taking
advantage of its stabilizing properties, a proper control
design is needed. To this end, two modiﬁcations of the
basic structure of Fig. 3 are proposed. Firstly, the maximum
desired lifting force f
MR,3
at controller output is limited.
This saturation value is set to approximately 120% of lifting
force at free hover (f
MR,3
≈ 1.2 f
MR,3
|
hov
). This means
that if the system operates at about a nominal tether tension
of T
?
C
≈ 0.2 f
MR,3
|
hov
, lifting force will be saturated and
small tension variations will turn instantaneously into vertical
motion, which allows landing by simply pulling the tether.
Secondly, the PI-D block is changed to a P-D after hovering
equilibrium when nominal tension of T
?
C
≈ 0.2 f
MR,3
|
hov
is reached. The values from the integral terms are captured
at this moment and provided to the controller during the
entire landing maneuver. With the integral terms switched
off, motion produced by small tension variations and other
disturbances will not cause the desired lifting force signal to
3099
vary too much from the saturation point, as nonzero position
errors will no longer be integrated.
B. Controller extension for counteracting tether tension-
induced moment
In order to account for undesired rotational inﬂuence of
the tether tension-induced moment, a feed-forward action
is proposed based on a tether tension vector estimation.
To this end, a force sensor (load cell) is used to measure
tension magnitude. Additionally, in order to establish the
orientation of the tension vector, the universal joint holding
the tether includes two magnetic encoders for measuring the
angles. Once the measurements of tension magnitudeT
m

and
universal joint angles q

are available, the tether moment
is calculated as follows

C. Tether-based position estimate for GPS replacement
In addition to the advantages in terms of stabilizing
properties, the use of the tether provides an alternate position
estimate for the controller, while its reliability will not be
affected by the lack of GPS accuracy. To this end, the
magnetic encoders measurement of the tether attitude relative
to the helicopter is used. Additionally, a radar altimeter is
incorporated into the system to acquire altitude information.
Assuming that tether tension is maintained about nominal

during landing mode (tether lies on a straight

is made in two steps. Firstly, assuming the

IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
A. Experimental setup
The experiments were performed with an unmanned heli-
copter based on the Aero-Tech CB-5000 platform shown in
Fig. 4a. This helicopter has a rotor diameter of 1.8m and
a main rotor speed of approximately 1300rpm, powered by
a 1.8kW two-stroke engine. The helicopter was equipped
with an IMU for measuring angular speed and estimating
Euler angles, a high precision radar altimeter for measuring
altitude, and a RTK system which allows comparison of
the tether-based estimates with a reliable reference. The
helicopter was tethered with a nylon rope. For that purpose,
a heavy steel plate with an area of approximately 1m
2
was
placed on the ground just below the helicopter. A pulley was
soldered to this base in order to allow application of tension
to the tether from a safe distance. As previously mentioned,
the tether was connected to the helicopter using a a two-axis
universal joint with one magnetic encoder attached to each
axis as shown in the Fig. 4a. Below the joint, a load cell to
measure the tether tension and a safety release mechanism
were placed as seen in Fig. 4b. This mechanism consisted of
a bolt inserted into a tube and ﬁxed inside by a pin which
can be pulled out by a servo to release the tether. The servo
can be triggered remotely by the safety pilot.
B. Experiment 1: Tether tension stabilizing action at hover
The goal of this experiment was to verify the stabilizing
action of tether tension in translational dynamics predicted
upon analysis of the mechanical model. To that end, dis-
turbances consisting of two consecutive steps in the lateral
position reference q
?
2
were applied at hover (see Fig. 5). The
two time intervals of the ﬁgure correspond to operation with
and without applied tension. It is clear that the effect of
disturbance on lateral position q
2
, as well as the amplitude
of longitudinal position q
1
oscillations, are reduced when
tension is applied to the tether, as can be observed by the
standard deviations (?).

C. Experiment 2: Tether-guided landing without GPS
In this experiment the objective was the validation of
the tether-guided landing approach without using the GPS
sensor. The results are shown in Fig. 6 and supplementary
video attachment
1
. During the entire landing maneuver, the
controller operation was based on the tether-based estimation
of linear position. Furthermore, in order to analyse the
accuracy of position estimate, the graphs also include the
position measured by the RTK system. Absolute values of
maximum error are less than 0.9m and 0.6m for q
1
and q
2
respectively. It can also be observed that error decreases as
altitude decreases.
After hovering with nominal tension applied to the tether,
the landing maneuver consisted of three phases. As can
be seen, at the time marked (a), the reference for relative
longitudinal and lateral position was set to zero, which
means the controller tried to maintain the helicopter on the
vertical line over the tether’s ﬁxed point at ground. At the
time marked (b) the tether was pulled down gently, thus
altitude started to decrease slowly. Finally, at time marked
(c) the helicopter touched down. As can be observed, the
landing was successful with 100% accuracy with respect to
the tether’s ﬁxed point at ground.
V. CONCLUSION
This paper extends the authors’ previous contributions
regarding the use of tethered conﬁgurations for improving
performance of unmanned helicopters. More precisely, this
work addresses two important issues when dealing with
hovering and landing maneuvers: the effects of disturbances
and sensor reliability.
Regarding sensor reliability, the often problematic GPS
measurement has been replaced by an alternative linear
position estimate based on measuring helicopter altitude and
tether attitude relative to the airframe. The validity of this
new sensing approach has been demonstrated in successful
landing experiments. Although the estimate accuracy is suf-
ﬁcient to allow a safe landing maneuver, the design of a

suitable observer to improve results seems to be a logical
continuation of this work. Concerning hovering performance,
the results have also endorsed the analysis which showed
stabilizing properties of the tethered conﬁguration in trans-
lational dynamics.
Since position estimate is relative to the landing point, it is
also worth mentioning that the sensing and control approach
proposed in this paper can potentially be used for tether-
guided landing on moving platforms. New experiments will
be performed in future in order to explore this possibility.
