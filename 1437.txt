Communication Adaptive Multi-Robot Simultaneous Localization and
Tracking via Hybrid Measurement and Belief Sharing
Chun-Kai Chang, Chun-Hua Chang and Chieh-Chih Wang
Abstract— Existing multi-robot cooperative perception so-
lutions can be mainly classiﬁed into two categories,
measurement-based and belief-based, according to the informa-
tion shared among robots. With well-controlled communication,
measurement-based approaches are expected to achieve theo-
retically optimal estimates while belief-based approaches are
not because the cross-correlations between beliefs are hard to
be perfectly estimated in practice. Nevertheless, belief-based
approaches perform relatively stable under unstable communi-
cation as a belief contains the information of multiple previous
measurements. Motivated by the observation that measurement
sharing and belief sharing are respectively superior in different
conditions, in this paper a hybrid algorithm, communication
adaptive multi-robot simultaneous localization and tracking
(ComAd MR-SLAT), is proposed to combine the advantages
of both. To tackle the unknown or unstable communication
conditions, the information to share is decided by maximizing
the expected uncertainty reduction online, based on which
the algorithm dynamically alternates between measurement-
sharing and belief-sharing without information loss or reuse.
The proposed ComAd MR-SLAT is evaluated in communication
conditions with different packet loss rates and bursty loss
lengths. In our experiments, ComAd MR-SLAT outperforms
measurement-based and belief-based MR-SLAT in accuracy.
The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed hybrid algorithm and exhibit that ComAd MR-SLAT
is robust under different communication conditions.
I. INTRODUCTION
Localization is one of the most essential capabilities for
autonomous robots [1]. In single-robot localization, the pose
of the robot w.r.t. a given map can be estimated in a
probabilistic manner by properly modeling the uncertainty of
motion commands and measurements [2][3]. With the ability
to detect other robots, multi-robot cooperative localization
has been proved to effectively outperform single-robot lo-
calization by incorporating relative measurements between
a troop of robots [4][5][6]. In addition, it has also been
demonstrated that multi-robot simultaneous localization and
tracking (MR-SLAT) can further improve the performance
by exploiting the relative measurements between robots and
moving objects in dynamic scenes [7][8].
Existing multi-robot cooperative perception solutions can
be mainly classiﬁed into two categories, measurement-based
and belief-based, according to the information shared among

the teammate robots. In measurement-based approaches
[4][6][8], the control data and measurements are shared once
after they are fetched. With well-controlled communication,
in which the packet loss rate is low and there are merely
consecutive packets lost, each robot is expected to receive
all control data and measurements from the other robots,
and the global state is inferred in a centralized manner.
In belief-based approaches [9][5][10][11][12][13][14], each
robot ﬁrstly fuses its own control data and measurements into
a local belief in a distributed way. Then the local beliefs are
shared to the teammate robots, and the global state is inferred
by merging the local beliefs.
This paper is motivated by the different characteristics of
the measurement-based and belief-based approaches against
different communication conditions. Fig. 1 shows the per-
formance of measurement-based and belief-based MR-SLAT
under different packet loss rates. It can be observed that when
the packet loss rate is low, the measurement-based approach
outperforms the belief-based one. The main reasons are: (1)
With perfect communication, centralized measurement-based
approaches are expected to achieve theoretically optimal
estimates while distributed belief-based approaches are not
as the cross-correlations between local beliefs are hard to
be perfectly estimated in practice[15]. (2) Sharing beliefs
generally requires more communication bandwidth, so under
the same communication load, the measurement loss rate
can be lowered by simple communication strategies such as
duplicated transmission. In contrast, the advantage of belief-
based MR-SLAT arises from the fact that a single belief
contains the information equivalent to multiple measure-
ments. While the performance of measurement-based MR-
SLAT gets worse when the packet loss rate gets higher, the
performance of belief-based one performs relatively stable
against packet loss as the information brought by the past
measurements has been encoded in the latest local beliefs.

Therefore, aiming at tackling practical scenes with un-
stable communication conditions, in this paper we pro-
pose communication adaptive MR-SLAT (ComAd MR-
SLAT), a hybrid algorithm combining the advantages of both
measurement-sharing and belief-sharing by explicitly taking
the communication condition into account. An online sharing
mode decision module is designed. Although theoretically
optimal sharing modes should be determined by optimizing
the localization and tracking accuracy, for practical online
applications, the exact performance cannot be determined
until actual measurements are fetched. Accordingly, we in-
stead reduce the problem from optimizing the performance in
accuracy to maximizing the expected uncertainty reduction in
order to select from measurement-sharing and belief-sharing.
With proper uncertainty models, estimates with the smaller
uncertainty are statistically expected to be more accurate.
In addition, based on the decided sharing modes, a hybrid
scheme is developed, in which the algorithm can dynamically
alternate between measurement-sharing and belief-sharing
without information loss or reuse.
The proposed ComAd MR-SLAT algorithm is evaluated
under different communication conditions in a multi-robot
setting. Following the motion models and sensor models used
in practical RoboCup scenes, e.g. odometry noises, feature
extraction noises, detection recall rates, various packet loss
rates and bursty loss lengths [16] are simulated to verify
the effectiveness of ComAd MR-SLAT. Note that not only
packet loss rates but also burtsy loss lengths can inﬂuence
the performance. In bursty loss, consecutive packets are lost
due to communication interference such occlusion. Under
the same communication load, measurement loss rates can
be lowered by duplicate transmission, but in bursty loss, the
loss rate of measurement-sharing would be closer to that of
belief-sharing. Accordingly, these two factors are analyzed in
our experiments. The experimental results demonstrate that
the proposed hybrid solution outperforms the measurment-
based MR-SLAT and belief-based MR-SLAT in localization
accuracy under different communication conditions and is
more robust against unstable communication conditions.
II. RELATED WORK
In multi-robot cooperative perception, measurement-based
algorithms have been proposed such as the particle ﬁlter
(PF) based approach [4], the maximum likelihood estimation
(MLE) based approach [6], and the extended Kalman ﬁlter
(EKF) based approach [8]. In these approaches, measure-
ments, e.g. map feature detection and robot detection, are
shared to the other robots after being fetched, and then the
global state is inferred in a centralized manner. Regarding
communication considerations, the communication condition
is not discussed in [4][6] and is assumed well-controlled in
[8].
On the other hand, various belief-based approaches have
also been proposed based on different techniques, such as
distributed EKF [5], distributed Sparse Extended Informa-
tion Filters (SEIF) [10], distributed maximum a posteriori
(MAP) [11], track-to-track fusion [9][12][13] and distributed
smoothing and mapping (SAM) [14]. In these approaches,
the measurements are ﬁrst locally fused into beliefs in a
decentralized manner. Then the beliefs are shared to the other
robots and the global state is inferred by merging the local
beliefs. Comparing to measurement-based approaches, one
of the advantages of the belief-based approaches is that the
computation can be distributed to multiple robots.
The comparison of measurement-based approaches and
belief-based approaches has been discussed in the litera-
ture. With well-controlled communication, the centralized
measurement-based approaches are expected to achieve bet-
ter performance than the decentralized ones as it is generally
hard to accurately estimate the correlations between tracks
of the same entity estimated by different robots in decen-
tralized approaches [15]. Though in [13], an exact solution
is proposed to decorrelate the cross correlations between
tracks and is proved optimal based on Kalman ﬁlter (KF)
assumptions, the correlation estimation is still approximate
in practical non-linear applications. In contrast, regarding
unstable communication conditions in practice, it has also
been argued that the decentralized belief-based approaches
have a higher tolerance to individual node failures due to the
communication issues [17].
Motivated by the different advantages of measurement-
based and belief-based approaches, in this paper we propose
a hybrid algorithm combining the merits of both. By con-
sidering the communication condition online, the proposed
communication adaptive approach dynamically determines
the information to share and achieves better performance in
accuracy as demonstrated in our experiments.
III. MULTI-ROBOT SIMULTANEOUS LOCALIZATION AND
TRACKING
In this section, the theoretical foundations of multi-robot
simultaneous localization and tracking (MR-SLAT) is intro-
duced, and measurement-based MR-SLAT and belief-based
MR-SLAT are described.

contains the position and

th
moving object at time t. In this paper,
we refer the robots to the entities that can communicate and
share information with the others, and the moving objects to
those that are not in the communication network.
B. Measurement-based MR-SLAT
In [8], following the theoretical framework of SLAMMOT
[7] the extended Kalman ﬁlter (EKF) is used to integrate
5017
the uncertain data fetched from the robots, in which the
covariance matrix maintains all of the pairwise correlations
between the robots and moving objects. Regarding motion
prediction, the odometry motion model is used for teammate
robots in the communication network while the constant
velocity (CV) model is used for the moving objects as the
control data is not available. Regarding the measurement
update, three types of measurements are aggregated: (1)
relative information between the robot and the map (robot-to-
map), (2) relative information between two teammate robots
(robot-to-robot), and (3) relative information between the
robot and the moving object (robot-to-moving-object).
In measurement-based MR-SLAT, the fetched odometry
data and measurements are shared to the teammates at each
time step. Accordingly, with well-controlled communication,
at timet each robot is expected to receive all odometry data
and measurements from all the other teammate robots. The
global state, Bel
1:t
, is inferred through the standard EKF
procedure recursively in a centralized manner:

where U

th
robot from
time 1 to time t and Z
i
1:t
the measurements. In this paper,
we denote the sufﬁx of the belief to indicate the time period
during which the information has been fused into the belief.
C. Belief-based MR-SLAT
In belief-based MR-SLAT, for each robot its own odom-
etry data and measurements are ﬁrstly fused into a local
belief following the same procedure as described in the
measurement-based approach. The local belief, Bel
i
1:t
, con-
tains the states of the i
th
robot itself and nearby moving
objects at time t:
Bel
i

Pr(X

) (3)
Instead of sharing measurements, in belief-based MR-SLAT
each robot shares beliefs to teammate robots, and then the
global state is inferred by merging self and received beliefs:

) (4)
whereBM() denotes the belief merging operator that can be
realized through any existing track-to-track fusion algorithm
[18].
In the track-to-track fusion literature, the merged global
belief can be fully-fed back, semi-fed back, or none-fed back.
In our implementation the none-feedback scheme is applied
in order to avoid the information reuse problem following
the arguments in [19]: If the merged global belief Bel
1:t
,
which has already contained the information of Bel
i
1:t
, is
fed back or replaces the local belief of thei
th
robot, then at
the next time to merge local beliefs, the information inBel
i
1:t
would be reused. On the other hand, in our implementation,
we exploit the merged global state to improve the data
association in local beliefs, which will be detailed in Section
IV-B.
D. Communication Considerations for Measurement-based
and Belief-based MR-SLAT
In theory, measurement-based MR-SLAT and belief-based
MR-SLAT are expected to achieve similar performance in
accuracy with well-controlled communication as the same
amount of information is utilized. Nevertheless, in practice
it can be observed that when the packet loss rate is low,
the measurement-based approach outperforms the belief-
based one as shown in Fig. 1. The ﬁrst reason is that the
communication bandwidth requirements for belief-sharing
and measurement-sharing could be different and in general,
belief-sharing requires more. For instance, in our application
the bandwidth required by belief-based MR-SLAT is 6 times
of that by measurement-based MR-SLAT in the case with
5 robots and 5 moving objects. Therefore, under the same
communication load, the loss rate of sharing measurements
can be lowered by simple communication strategies such
as duplicated transmission. Two other reasons making the
measurement-based MR-SLAT better under well-controlled
communication conditions are: (1) When merging two be-
liefs, it is hard to perfectly estimate the cross-covariance
between two beliefs [15][18], and (2) Measurement-based
MR-SLAT maintains only one global state whose uncertainty
is generally less than the local beliefs maintained in belief-
based MR-SLAT, so Gaussian approximation and lineariza-
tion are better in measurement-based MR-SLAT.
In contrast, the advantage of belief-based MR-SLAT arises
from the fact that a single belief contains the informa-
tion equivalent to multiple measurements. For measurement-
based MR-SLAT, once a measurement is lost, the information
brought by it is permanently lost. As can be seen in Fig. 1, the
performance of measurement-based MR-SLAT gets worse
when the packet loss rate gets higher while the performance
of belief-based MR-SLAT is relatively stable against packet
loss as by deﬁnition, the information brought by the past
measurements has been encoded in the latest local beliefs.
Motivated by these observations, the communication adap-
tive MR-SLAT (ComAd MR-SLAT) algorithm is proposed
aiming at combining the advantages of measurement-based
MR-SLAT and belief-based MR-SLAT. By explicitly taking
the communication condition into account, the information
to share is determined dynamically online.
IV. COMMUNICATION ADAPTIVE MR-SLAT
In this section, the proposed communication adaptive MR-
SLAT (ComAd MR-SLAT) algorithm is described.
A. Online Sharing Mode Determination
An online decision module is designed in order to ap-
propriately determine the sharing mode, i.e. measurement-
sharing or belief-sharing, given the current state and the
communication condition. To explain our developed algo-
rithm, we start from analyzing the case of two robots.
Assuming that the i
th
robot is sharing information to the
j
th
robot, the theoretical optimal sharing mode can be
determined according to the following equation:

i!j
= argmax

f(;Bel
i
1:t
;Bel
j
1:t
;R
m
;R
b
;T) (5)
5018
where  is a binary variable indicating the sharing mode
with 0: measurement-sharing or 1: belief-sharing, Bel
i
1:t
and Bel
j
1:t
the current beliefs of the i
th
robot and the j
th
robot,R
m
the loss rate for sharing measurements andR
b
for
sharing beliefs, T the time period within which we tried to
determine the sharing mode, and f the function evaluating
the performance in accuracy. Note that both R
m
and R
b
are needed as measurements and beliefs are of different
sizes, so their loss rates could be different under the same
communication load.
Through f, the algorithm selects the sharing mode by
optimizing the estimation accuracy. However, for practical
online algorithms, the exact performance in accuracy can-
not be determined before actual measurements are fetched.
Therefore, we instead reduce estimating f to estimating
U
z
and U
b
in a probabilistic manner, which determine the
expected uncertainty reduction by measurement-sharing and
belief-sharing respectively:
f(;Bel
i
1:t
;Bel
j
1:t
;R
m
;R
b
;T)
(
U
z
(Bel
i
1:t
;Bel
j
1:t
;R
m
;T); if  = 0
U
b
(Bel
i
1:t
;Bel
j
1:t
;R
b
;T); if  = 1
(6)
In other words, we decide the sharing mode that maximizes
the expected uncertainty reduction as the estimate with
smaller uncertainty is more likely to be accurate as long as
the noise models are statistically correct.
Now our goal is to take the packet loss effects into
account in evaluating U
z
and U
b
. Regarding U
z
, based
on the common practice that measurements are assumed
without cross correlations and are processed independently
in measurement-based MR-SLAT, we ﬁrstly generate the
expected pseudo measurements according to the expected
time of receiving one new measurement, which can be esti-
mated from the loss rate R
m
, the performance of the front-
end feature extraction modules, and the scene setting. For
instance, assuming that in average there are 2 entities in view,
the recall rate of object detection is 0.5, and the packet loss
rate is 0.5, the estimated time of receiving one measurement
is 1=(20:50:5) = 2 time steps. In addition, for generating
data associations for the pseudo measurements, without loss
of generality we assume that the objects in the current state
are equally-likely to be observed. Based on the generated
pseudo measurements, the expected uncertainty reduction
through sharing measurements considering the packet loss
effects can be estimated following the standard measurement-
based MR-SLAT procedure.
Different from estimating U
z
, it would be incorrect to
estimateU
b
by expected pseudo beliefs as there are obviously
strong correlations between beliefs to share: At time T
1
,
once Bel
i
1:T1
has been successfully received by the j
th
robot, the effects of Bel
i
1:1
, Bel
i
1:2
, ..., Bel
i
1:T1 1
should
be ignored as their information has already been contained
in Bel
i
1:T1
. More speciﬁcally, considering the loss rate R
b
,
the effect of each belief on uncertainty reduction follows
the geometric distribution, and accordingly the expected
uncertainty reduction of sharing beliefs can be estimated as:
U
b
(Bel
i

;R

;T) =

)

(1 R
b

b
(t;Bel

;Bel

(7)
where I
b
is the function estimating the expected uncertainty
reduction by sharing beliefs when the last successfully re-
ceived belief occurred at timet. Similarly,I
b
can be inferred
by ﬁrstly generating the pseudo expected measurements, and
then following the belief-based MR-SLAT procedure, the
expected uncertainty reduction considering the loss rate can
be estimated.
Based on the estimation process of expected uncertainty
reduction between two robots, the sharing mode of the i
th
robot is decided by comparing the summations of the esti-
mated expected uncertainty reductions to all the other team-
mate robots with measurement-sharing and belief-sharing
respectively:

In the case with two nodes, our proposed decision module
resorts to the optimal solution in the probabilistic point of
view. However, Equation 8 only resorts to an approximate
solution as the information shared among the other robots
are neglected. The reason of this information ignorance is
due to the observation that to estimate that information,
the algorithm has to enumerate all possible sharing-modes
of all the robots, which would result in an algorithm with
exponentially-growing complexity that can be inapplicable
in practice. However, our experiments demonstrate that by
Equation 8 the proposed decision module provides satisfac-
tory results, based on which ComAd MR-SLAT outperforms
measurement-based and belief-based MR-SLAT under dif-
ferent communication conditions.
One remaining issue is that in practical online applications,
the communication conditions, i.e. loss rates for sharing
measurements and beliefs, are unknown at the time when
making the sharing mode decisions. In our implementation,
the sharing mode is decided for every 3 second-long window
based on the communication condition predicted statistically
by the condition in the previous window.
Fig. 2 shows a result of the developed mode decision
for two nodes in a 300-frame sequence. Note that be-
cause of the different communication load requirements of
measurement-sharing and belief-sharing, the loss rate of
sharing measurements is less than or equal to the loss rate of
sharing beliefs by simple duplicated transmission under the
same communication bandwidth. Our mode decision module
behaves as expected: The measurement-sharing mode is
selected when there is no packet loss or the packet loss
rate is low while the belief-sharing mode is selected when
the packets are lost in a burst, which reﬂects the intuition
that when consecutive packets are lost, sharing-beliefs is
preferred as the beliefs carry the information of multiple
previous lost measurements. Based on the decided sharing

B. Hybrid Measurement and Belief Sharing
This section describes our hybrid MR-SLAT that can
dynamically alternate between sharing measurements and
beliefs given the online decided sharing modes. The main
requirement for the algorithm design is that in the condition
of perfect communication, the information of each measure-
ment should be used exactly once, which means it should be
guaranteed that there is no information loss or reuse in the
designed algorithm.
For clarity, the algorithm is explained in two different
views, the sender’s view and the receiver’s view, but note
that in practice each robot plays the sender and the receiver
at the same time.
1) Information Sender’s View: When the i
th
robot is
in the measurement-sharing mode, the robot simply sends
the new fetched measurements and odometry data to the
teammate robots as in measurement-based MR-SLAT. When
the i
th
robot is decided to switch from the measurement-
sharing mode to the belief-sharing mode from T
1
to T
2
, a
separate local EKF is created to integrate its measurements
and odometry data between T
1
and T
2
:

Pr(X

(9)
The beliefs, Bel
i
T1:t
for T
1
 t  T
2
, are shared to the
teammate robots between T
1
andT
2
. Note that these beliefs
do not fuse the measurements before T
1
in order to prevent
the information reuse.
In our implementation, the created local EKF is initialized
with sufﬁciently large uncertainty. However, one critical
issue is that the uncertainty of these newly created EKFs
could be larger than those in the original measurement-based
or belief-based approaches because less measurements are
fused, so the data association gets more challenging as the
data association uncertainty is increased. Accordingly, we
exploit the merged global state to assist data association in
local-belief EKFs by only applying the measurements that
satisfy the Mahalanobis distance gating in both of the local
belief and the merged-global state. The computation of the
merged global state is explained in the information receiver’s
view in the following.
2) Information Receiver’s View: Each robot always main-
tains a state, Bel
M
1:t
, which integrates the odometry data
and measurements of the robot itself and those in the
measurement-sharing mode:

(10)
where M denotes the set of robots in the measurement-
sharing mode, and T
j
denotes the last time from which the
j
th
robot switched to the belief-sharing mode. At each time
step the global state is inferred by merging Bel
M

with the
other beliefs received from the robots in belief-sharing mode:
Bel
1:t
BM(Bel

For preventing the information reuse problem, the merged
global state Bel
1:t
would not be replaced or fed back to
Bel
M
1:t
to keep Bel
M
1:t
containing information only from the
robot itself and those in the measurement-sharing mode.
In the proposed scheme, the global stateBel
1:t
is exploited
during data association gating for robustness as described
in the previous section. In addition, when the j
th
robot
is decided to switch from the belief-sharing mode to the
measurement-sharing mode at T
3
, our algorithm fuses its
local belief Bel
j
Tj:T3
into Bel
M
1:t
to make sure that its
odometry data and measurements contained in Bel
j
Tj:T3
are
not lost.
V. EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION
In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid
algorithm, ComAd MR-SLAT is evaluated under different
packet loss rates and different bursty loss lengths.
A. Experimental Scene Setting
The experimental scene follows the RoboCup Standard
Platform League (SPL) scenario, in which two teams of
robots move in the soccer ﬁeld consisting several map
features, e.g. four goal posts, the center circle, corners, and
white lines. In order to get statistically meaningful results, 80
runs of Monte Carlo simulations are conducted for each com-
munication setting. The algorithm is executed at the frame
rate of 5 Hz. Each run lasts 60 seconds, i.e. 300 frames, and
in each run, the robots are placed randomly at the beginning
with a random moving direction. If the robot moves outside
the ﬁeld, the moving direction is randomly decided again.

The odometry motion model is used for teammate robots
that can share information to each others and the constant
velocity (CV) model for opponent robots. Relative range and
bearing measurements to nearby map features and robots
are extracted. The motion and sensor models follow the
parameters we applied in practical RoboCup competitions
[8]. In addition, to evaluate the proposed ComAd MR-
SLAT under different communication conditions, packets are
randomly selected to be lost in each run. Different packet
loss rates (0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 06, and 0.8) and different bursty
loss lengths (1, 20, 30, and 40 frames) are veriﬁed, where
the packet loss rates denote the overall ratio of lost packets,
and the bursty loss lengths denote the average lengths of
consecutive lost packets, except that with bursty length 1,
the packet loss is simulated to occur independently for each
time frame.
B. Five-vs.-Five with Homogeneous Communication
This experiment simulates a ﬁve-vs.-ﬁve scenario as shown
in Fig. 3. Blue circles denote robots that can share infor-
mation to each other, and black circles denote the moving
objects. In this experiment, homogeneous communication
conditions between each paired robots are assumed, which
simulates the case in which communication is realized
through one centralized device such as the WiFi device used
in practical RoboCup competitions.
The performance of localization accuracy averaged from
80 Monte Carlo runs under different packet loss rates and
bursty loss lengths is shown in Fig. 4. Firstly, regarding
packet loss rates, it can be seen that the measurement-
based MR-SLAT outperforms belief-based MR-SLAT when
the packet loss rate is low while belief-based MR-SLAT
performs more stably when the packet loss rate increases,
which is consistent with our understanding of the character-
istics of the two approaches. Regarding bursty loss lengths, it
can be observed that as the bursty loss length increases, the
advantage of sharing beliefs approach gets more signiﬁcant
as when consecutive packets are lost, beliefs containing mul-
tiple previous measurements can prevent the measurements
from being permanently lost. In the other extreme case
where the bursty length is 1, in which each packet gets lost
independently, the measurement-based approach is preferred
as by simply retransmission, the measurement loss rate can
be much lowered comparing to the belief-based approach
with the same communication load.
It can be seen that our proposed ComAd MR-SLAT out-
performs measurement-based and belief-based approaches.
In the case with bursty loss length 1, ComAd MR-SLAT
correctly decides to share measurements and achieves the
same performance as the measurement-based MR-SLAT.
While in the cases with other bursty lengths, ComAd MR-
SLAT achieves better results. It is also worth mentioning that
ComAd MR-SLAT can achieve more accurate results than
the better one of measurement-based and belief-based MR-
SLAT as even in one sequence with the same communication
condition, the optimal sharing mode could be interleaved by
measurement-sharing and belief-sharing, e.g. measurement-

motion models and sensor models used in practical RoboCup scenes, e.g.
odometry noises, feature extraction noises, detection recall rates, various
packet loss rates and bursty loss lengths are simulated. Blue circles denote

moving objects.
sharing in the ﬁrst half and belief-sharing in the second half,
which can only be achieved by the communication adaptive
algorithm. This experiment demonstrates the effectiveness
of the developed sharing mode decision module and that
the proposed ComAd MR-SLAT successfully combines the
advantages of measurement-based and belief-based MR-
SLAT.
C. Heterogeneous Communication and Scalability
The proposed ComAd MR-SLAT is also evaluated in the
case of heterogeneous communication that the packet loss
conditions between each pair of robots are independent,
which simulates the scenario where communication links
are established in a robot-to-robot way. The results under
different packet loss rates and bursty loss lengths are shown
in Fig. 5. The results again demonstrate that the proposed Co-
mAd MR-SLAT outperforms measurement-based and belief-
based MR-SLAT, which veriﬁes the effectiveness of ComAd
MR-SLAT with heterogeneous communication links between
robots. However, it can be observed that comparing to the
homogeneous communication case, the performance of Co-
mAd MR-SLAT is closer to the better one of measurement-
based and belief-based MR-SLAT, and the reason is that
when the robot tries to decide the sharing mode in the
heterogeneous communication case, it is possible that some
of its teammates prefer measurement-sharing while the others
prefer belief-sharing, so the performance difference between
the two sharing modes could be less obvious. However, the
proposed method still selects the sharing mode expected to
be better and mostly achieves the preferable performance
among the three approaches under comparison.
In addition, the scalability of ComAd MR-SLAT is also
evaluated in a 10-vs.-10 scene as the setting illustrated in
Fig. 6. The results are shown in Fig. 7. Due to the page
limits of the paper, only the results of bursty lengths 1 and
40 are shown, but the results of other bursty lengths are
similar. In this experiment, the proposed hybrid algorithm
also works and based on the decided sharing-modes, ComAd
MR-SLAT outperforms measurement-based and belief-based
approaches.

VI. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, a communication adaptive multi-robot si-
multaneous localization and tracking (ComAd MR-SLAT)
algorithm is proposed to deal with practical scenes in
which the communication condition is unknown or unstable.
Motivated by the observation that sharing measurements
and sharing beliefs are respectively superior in different
communication conditions, a hybrid approach is developed
to combine the advantages of both. By maximizing the
expected uncertainty reduction, the sharing modes is decided
considering the communication conditions online. Based on
the decided sharing modes, the hybrid algorithm dynamically
switches between measurement-sharing and belief-sharing
without information loss or reuse. The proposed algorithm
is evaluated in the RoboCup scenario. Following the models
used in the practical RoboCup competitions, Monte Carlo
runs with different packet loss rates and bursty lengths
are simulated. In the experiments, the proposed ComAd
MR-SLAT outperforms measurement-based MR-SLAT and
belief-based MR-SLAT in localization accuracy. The experi-
mental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
algorithm and exhibit that ComAd MR-SLAT is robust under
different communication conditions.
