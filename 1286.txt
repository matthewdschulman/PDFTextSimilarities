Abstract—Life-size humanoids which have the same joint
arrangement as humans are expected to help in the living
environment. In this case, they require high load operations
such as gripping and conveyance of heavy load, and holding
people at the care spot. However, these operations are difﬁcult
for existing humanoids because of their low joint output.
Therefore, the purpose of this study is to develop the high-
output life-size humanoid robot. We ﬁrst designed a motor
driver for humanoid with featuring small, water-cooled, and
high output, and it performed higher joint output than existing
humanoids utilizing.
In this paper, we describe designed humanoid arm and leg
with this motor driver. The arm is featuring the designed
2-axis unit and the leg is featuring the water-cooled double
motorsystem.Wedemonstratedthearm’shightorqueandhigh
velocity experiment and the leg’s high performance experiment
based on water-cooled double motor compared with air-cooled
and single motor. Then we designed and developed a life-size
humanoid with these arms and legs. We demonstrated some
humanoid’s experiment operating high load to ﬁnd out the arm
and leg’s validity.
I. INTRODUCTION
In recent years, many researchers have studied and devel-
oped robots that can perform the assistance of daily life. It is
expected that humanoids can achieve various operations and
tasks without any changes in human environments, because
they have the same structure as the human body[1].
Humanoids should be able to carry not only lightweight
objects, such as plates and a cup, but also heavy objects[2]
[3], such as tables, desks, refrigerators, and humans in care
ﬁeld[4]. They are also required to move using the whole
body,suchasgoinguptheladderandperformingtaskswhile
caught in a high place, and also, when unexpected events
occur, they are required to do avoidance behavior such as
falling back at the moment [5]. The above actions require
humanoids of high output and high velocity.
In order to make humanoid perform heavy load motion,
we develop the whole body with high output joints. Urata
et al. developed a high-speed large output motor-axis driver
system[6]. They developed a biped robot ’HRP3-JSK-LEG’
with such a high-powered actuator system and the robot
can perform remarkable jump operations and fall prevention
which need quick footwork [7].
This study aims to develop a life-size humanoid that can
support everyday life with its high physical performance.
In this paper, we develop a high output arms and legs and

demonstrate the utility of their high performance. Then, we
develop a life-size humanoid with the arms and legs, and
demonstrate whole body motion.

In previous section, we describe humanoid for human life
support which requires the following point.
• Instantaneous force required in an emergency
• Range of motion in dual-arm operation for climbing up
a high step
• Steady high-output in order to support high load
In order to solve these, a humanoid requires high perfor-
mance of both large torque and high joint velocity, joint con-
ﬁguration with redundant degrees of freedom, and exhaust
systems of heat generated by the steady load. The design
proposals to meet these are below.
• High-output axial driven system

• Redundant D.O.F. arm that consists of 2-axis units with
wide range of motion
• Leg with water-cooled double motor
Therefore, we design and developed the life-size hu-
manoid. Fig.1 , Table I shows the appearance and speciﬁca-
tion. We use a water-cooled high-speed large-output motor-
axis driver system developed for high output joint driven
system[6].Inthispaper,wedescribenewmodules,whichare
2-axis unit and water-cooled double motor. We will describe
the detail in the following section.
A. DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT OF 2-AXIS UNIT
Fig. 2. Over view of 2-axis unit using high-output motor driver
Fig. 3. Reachability comparison of HRP2 and developed humanoid arm
by reachability simulator OpenRAVE
We developed 2-axis unit in which double-supported axis
and the cantilever axis are orthogonal. Fig.2 shows the
appearance of this unit. which have MAXON EC-4pole 30
200W motor, and harmonic drive reducer, and each motor in
air cooling now. In the future, we can change the air-cooling
motor to water-cooled motor at the joint of heavy load in
the experiment, which enable arm to perform higher steady
output. The unit has two type of axis. One is the double-
supported axis with 135 deg R.O.M.(Range of Motion)
and another is the cantilever axis with 180 deg R.O.M..
This R.O.M. is determined by the reachability simulator
’OpenRAVE’[8] developed by Rosen et al. Fig.3 shows the
developed arm’s reachability map. This reachability map is
colored, based on the proportion of arrival direction to a
certain point. The reachable points from every direction are
colored red and the red region of the arm is much larger
than that of HRP2. The points are also much larger than the
double-supported axis’s R.O.M. being 90[deg], 120[deg] or
the arm being 7 D.O.F.. In this result, we determined this
axis’s R.O.M.
B. DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT OF WATER-
COOLED DOUBLE-MOTOR
Fig. 4. The design of double motor unit
In this section, we describe a water-cooled double motor
system. Some researches improve the joint torque by double
motor [9][10]. The feature of our research is water-cooled
system. Fig.4 shows water-cooled unit’s appearance. The
unit is sealed and coupled to the motor by sealing adhesive,
and the inside is separated into 14 blocks where water is
circulated. That’s why motors are cooled efﬁciently without
puddle layer. Another feature is the driving system of double
motor. One motor is position controlled, and another motor
is current controlled, which means current same as position
controlled motor’s one ﬂows. This performs torque assist
to the position control motor and enable double motor to
prevent an increase in the internal force which occurs when
two motors are position controlled.
III. DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT OF LIFE-SIZE
HUMANOID ROBOT WITH HIGH OUTPUT
MOTOR DRIVING SYSTEM
We design and developed the life-size humanoid The
appearance and speciﬁcation was posted to Fig.1 and Table

90[kg], Total D.O.F. is 32, which include the head’s 2 D.O.F.
waist’s 2 D.O.F., arm’s 8 D.O.F., leg’s 6 D.O.F.. The head,
waist,headusehigh-output2-axisunitabove.Thishumanoid
needs 2[l] coolant water which is circulated in the body.
All motor drivers and knee and hip motor are water-cooled.
Power source is external 13[F] capacitor, which is equivalent
to 41.6[kWs] driven in 80[V]. We will describe the detail of
the design of each arm and leg in the following section.
A. DEVELOPMENT Of ARM LINK WITH HIGH-
OUTPUT 2-AXIS UNITS
In this section, we describe the design of high-output
humanoid arm. Fig.5 shows the appearance of the high-
output arm with high-output shaft drive system described
above. The weight is 9.2[kg]. The link length between joints
is 300[mm].
The point of the design of this arm is hand reachable
area (reachability). When the reachability in front is wide,

Humanoids can manipulate the objects on the desk without
moving their body too much. In addition, the wide reachabil-
ityinfrontenablehumanoidstoworkeasilywithdoublearm.
In particular, when they manipulate heavy loads, they are
required to use double arm and perform the highest output.
This arm is 8 D.O.F., and has an additional chest yaw joint
to HRP2-JSK’s 7 D.O.F. arm[11], which enable the arm to
movewidelytofrontarea.TableII showsthisarm’srangeof
motion compared with HRP2. For simplicity of design and
low cost, this 8 D.O.F. arm is developed with four 2-axis
joint units

In this section, the detail of high-output bipedal hu-
manoid leg with water-cooling double motor is introduced.
Fig.6 shows the appearance of this leg. The weight is 50[kg]
and the D.O.F. is 12 which is same as HRP2 and HRP3-JSK-
LEG. The joints are axial driven using motor and harmonic
drive reducer with pulley whose reduction ratio is 240:1.
The link length between joints is 350[mm] which is 50[mm]
longer than HRP2 and HRP3-JSK-LEG whose link length
is 300[mm]. Table III shows the leg’s range of motion
compared with HRP2 and that the leg has wide range of
motion. For wide angle range of motion, ankle pitch joint
and ankle roll joint is not orthogonal axis whereas HRP2’s
ankle joint is orthogonal.
This leg is designed in the basis of the knowledge of
humanoid walking from HRP3-JSK-LEG. The arrival point
of the leg’s tip is important for walking motion and this
is largely related hip joint stiffness. The little modiﬁcation
of hip joint can lead to large error of the leg’s reached
point. So the hip link and joint are S45C which is SC
steel with high stiffness, and other links and joints are
A7075 which is extra super duralumin. In order to make the
whole leg light and high stiffness, each link is made up of
integrallymachining. Because hip and knee joints require the
large torque for controlling posture, these joints use larger
harmonic drive reducer than other joints. This harmonic has
ratcheting torque limit. In particular, these pitch joint use
water-cooled double motor in order to perform high static
output. Hip roll joint uses air-cooled motor now, so changing
thismotortowater-cooledmotorenablesthisjointtoperform
higher static output. In life support action, the humanoid
body and links contact with external environment. so the
motors and electronic boards are placed inside of the link.
IV. THE PERFORMANCE EXPERIMENT BY
DEVELOPED HUMANOID
In order to verify the high performance of developed arm
and leg above, With developed arm and leg, we demonstrate
some heavy lift operations. to show the arm’s large output
and high velocity. The detail is below.
A. THE HEAVY LIFT OPERATION WHICH SHOWS
LARGE OUTPUT
In this experiment, we describe this arm’s heavy lift
operation which conforms its large output. Fig.7 shows the
experiment. The experimental conditions is as follows. The
32.5[kg] heavy weight is attached to the arm tip and the
arm lift up to 90[cm] high in 8[s]. Fig.8 describes each
joint’s motor current in this experiment. The max current is
3435
Fig. 7. 32.5kg Weight lifting experiment by developed humanoid arm
Fig. 8. Each joints’ current value in weight lifting experiment
24.5[A] in the joint 4. Hence, the max torque is 158[Nm]
calculated by this current and motor driving voltage 80[V].
Joint 1 and 3 performed as same torque as joint 4. This
experiment shows that this arm can lift weight equivalent
of the human body weight 65[kg] with double-arm. Ohmura
et al. enable a bipedal humanoid to pull 66[kg] human doll
closer based on load distribution by his arms’ touch sensor
[3]. The developed arm can perform as same high output as
this humanoid by joint output.
B. THROWING LIGHT BALL EXPERIMENT BASED
ON HIGH JOINT VELOCITY
Fig. 9. Throwing ball experiment in max angle velocity 250deg/s by
developed humanoid arm
In this section, we illustrate the throwing light ball oper-
ation which shows high joint velocity. Fig.9 shows how to
throw the ball from a stationary state of the experiment In
Fig. 10. Each joints’ velocity value in throwing ball experiment
this experiment, each joint moves to a goal and stop quickly
and the ball is removed from the tip of the arm. As a result,
theball reachedabout 5[m] front.Fig.10 indicates each joint
velocity. This experiment shows that the max joint velocity
is 263[deg/s] in joint 6. The motor voltage is 48[V], so when
the voltage is 80[V] the joints can move 500[deg/s] which
is calculated from motor spec. HRP2’s same joint can move
up to 264[deg/s] in the speciﬁcation, so the developed arm
took a speed equal to this maximum value.
C. THE TEMPERATURE COMPARISON EXPERI-
MENT OF WATER-COOLED DOUBLE MOTOR
Fig. 11. Change of motor temperature in each situation by humanoid leg
with 50kg weight
In this section, we conducted the experiment that indicates
high static torque of water-cooled double motor. In this
experiment, we compared the temperature with air-cooled
single motor, air-cooled double motor, water-cooled single
motor, and water-cooled double motor by squatting experi-
ment which is the most stressful on the knee joint. In this
experiment, motor voltage is 80[V], body weight is 100[kg]
with weight, knee angle is 98[deg] and we measured the
timeoftemperaturereachingabout100[
?
C]Fig.11 indicates
the experimental overview and motor temperature change.
Single motor, which is both air-cooled and water-cooled,
reach 100[
?
C] instantly. Air-cooled double motor keep up
as a while, but it was also not to reach the temperature
equilibrium state and it reached 100[
?
C] in the end. These
results shows that 100[kg] humanoid always require water-
cooled double motor when it operates.
D. BENDING AND STRETCHING WITH 100KG
HEAVY WEIGHT EXPERIMENT BY DEVELOPED
LEG
In this section, bending and stretching with heavy weight
experiment is conducted by developed leg. Fig.12 shows
3436
Fig. 12. Bending and stretching experiment by developed leg with 100kg
weight
Fig. 13. Change of motor current in bending experiment
bending from the high position and stretching from the
low position of the experiment. In this experiment, motor
voltage is 80[V], 100[kg] weight is on the upper body and
body weight is 150[kg], and the leg bends and stretches
300[mm]around98[deg]kneeangleat4[s].Fig.13 indicates
the hip and knee joints’ motor current change. The knee’s
max current value is 82[A] to double motor. Urata et al.
demonstrated the 62.5[kg] heavy weight lifting experiment
by water-cooled single motor with one foot[6]. So water-
cooleddoublemotorandtwofootcanlift250[kg]weightbut
the leg can’t lift more than 100[kg] because of harmonic’s
performance limit and torque limit of pulleys and belts of
harmonic gears.
E. STEPPING WITH 100KG HEAVY WEIGHT EX-
PERIMENT BY DEVELOPED LEG
Fig. 14. Stepping experiment by developed leg with 100kg weight
We demonstrated stepping experiment with heavy weight
on upper body. Fig.14 show the experiment. In this experi-
Fig. 15. Change of ﬂoor reaction force in stepping experiment
Fig. 16. Change of motor current in stepping experiment
ment, 100[kg] weight is put on the upper body, knee angle
is 98[deg], the leg moved the center of gravity 50[mm] to
left and right at 2.8[s], and it stepped by 2[cm]. Fig.15 and
Fig.16 shows the ﬂoor reactions, motor current, and internal
motor temperature at hip roll, knee, and ankle pitch joints
which applied a load of stepping. In this experiment, C.O.G.
leans front side and large torque is required at ankle joints.
This is considered to improve by the implementation of the
better posture stabilizer. The most heavy load occur at the
weight retention in one foot. The max current is knee’s
87.6[A] and hip roll’s 34.8[A] at that time.
HUBO FX-1 at KAIST[12], WL-16RV by Hashimoto
et al.[13] are cited as an example in which the bipedal
humanoid leg which can hold the heavy weight and walk.
These can hold 100[kg], 80[kg] in the speciﬁcation, and the
developed robot can perform as high output as them.
V. GOING UP TO THE HIGH ALTITUDE
EXPERIMENT BY DEVELOPED HUMANOID
With the developed humanoid, we demonstrated the going
up to the high altitude experiment, which is one of the high
load operation using whole body. Fig.17 ,Fig.18 shows the
experiment appearance and the results. In this experiment,
the humanoid puts his hands on handrail of 880[mm] height
and goes up to 410[mm] stair which is difﬁcult because it is
longer than leg link length 350[mm]. First, humanoid puts
on right foot on the stair (Fig.18 (a),(b)), after that, he raises
the left root (Fig.18 (c),(d)) with load balancing to arm. The
motion is generated in advance by ZMP position control in
consideration the hand reaction force. In this experiment,
hand reaction force is set up 200[N].
Fig.18 shows hand and foot reaction forces and motor
current of elbow, knee, and hip joints which require high
3437
Fig. 17. Stepping the stool in the height of 410mm by developed humanoid
Fig. 18. Outline of stepping the stool experiment, motor current graph and
ﬂoor reaction at each arms and legs
output. In this action, support leg require high output. In
particular, when right foot raises the left foot (c), right knee
joint performed 226[Nm] which is calculated by motor cur-
rent 37[A], motor’s calculation number 20.5[mNm/A], and
reduction ratio 240:1. This torque is higher than HRP2’s max
one. This result indicates developed humanoid’s efﬁciency.
In addition, each tip of arms apply 100 to 200[N] force
constantly. and this shows arms and legs’ load balancing. El-
bow joint performed 59[Nm] and max elbow’s performance
is 84[Nm]. This experiment shows the high output of the
whole body and the physical performance in order to go up
410[mm] high using whole body.
VI. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we described the necessity of high output
whole body for heavy load action to humanoid in order
to help humans in daily life. We designed and developed
humanoid arms, legs, and whole body with Urata’s high
output water-cooled motor driver.
The developed arm is characterized with wide reachability
and 2axis joint drive unit. This arm can lift up 32.5[kg]
weight and throw a ball by 263[deg/s] in joint velocity. The
developed leg is characterized with the mechanical structure
and water-cooled double motor. This leg can stretch and step
with 100[kg] weight. Then the developed life-size humanoid
with these arms and legs can perform high output in whole
body and go a step elevation of 410[mm] These results can
help consider humanoid’s body spec at the point of current,
torque, gear ratio, and so on.
In the future, we will demonstrate the high-load operation
in static such as slowly lifting the weight. We will also
demonstrate the dynamic movement based on instant high
velocity.
