 
1Abstract— This paper proposes an expertise-oriented training 
platform for robotics-assisted minimally invasive surgery. The 
framework builds on previous work of the authors and makes 
use of dual-user teleoperation scenario, allowing the presence of 
an expert in the training loop. A Fuzzy-Logic (FL) methodology 
is proposed, which specifies the level/mode of the training 
required for the trainee according to his/her level of proficiency 
over the task. A major advantage of the proposed FL approach 
is that, having the expert in the loop, it can specify the trainee’s 
proficiency level relative to that of the expert in real-time. 
Moreover, based on the relative skills assessment, the proposed 
FL approach decides if or to what extent the trainee should 
receive a haptic guidance force based on Virtual Fixtures or the 
environment force from the interaction between the surgical 
instrument and tissue at the slave side. In addition to the 
level/mode of the haptics-enabled training required for the 
trainee, the proposed FL framework specifies the authority 
level of the trainees over the operation in real-time, according 
to their proficiency levels over the task. Stability of the overall 
closed-loop teleoperated system is also investigated using the 
small-gain theorem, resulting in a sufficient condition to 
guarantee stability in the presence of constant communication 
delays. Finally, experimental results are given to evaluate the 
design and feasibility of the proposed framework.

I. INTRODUCTION 
Robotics-Assisted Minimally invasive surgery (RAMIS) 
offers several benefits, including: faster recovery, reduced 
trauma and improved cosmesis for patients, as well as 
increased dexterity, stereovision capability, tremor filtering 
and motion scaling [1], [2]. While this form of surgery has 
significant advantages for patients, it could be challenging 
for novice surgeons and residents to perform. Achieving 
technical competence requires a well-planned learning 
strategy. For successful RAMIS, effective surgical training 
is necessary for novice surgeons to acquire appropriate 
psychomotor skills [3].

* Project Leader 
 
In order to provide on-demand training to trainees for 
RAMIS, Intuitive Surgical Inc. has developed the da Vinci 
Skills Simulator [4] which is operated from the surgeon’s 
console of the da Vinci. The Simulator incorporates a virtual 
reality (VR)-based simulation platform from Mimic [5] and 
provides the trainee with the look and feel of the da Vinci 
Surgical System. The latest addition to the da Vinci
®
 product 
line, the dual-console da Vinci Si Surgical System [6], 
addresses questions that normally arise regarding fidelity of 
the simulation environment by providing a feature that 
enables a trainee to be involved in an actual surgical 
procedure. However, in this system the training is offered to 
the trainee based on a see-and-repeat approach, but without 
any haptic cues from the expert guiding the trainee along the 
proper path of the surgery.  
In [7], the authors proposed a dual-user teleoperated 
surgical training approach incorporating Virtual Fixtures 
(VFs), that allows a trainee surgeon to receive training based 
on haptic cueing, while an expert performs a surgery. Using 
the dual-user teleoperation concept, both the trainee and the 
expert can be involved in the surgery, while the trainee’s 
involvement level over the task can be adaptively adjusted in 
real-time based on his/her proficiency level over the 
operation. In addition, the presence of an expert in the loop 
through the dual-user framework allows online evaluation of 
the trainee’s proficiency level relative to that of the expert. 
In contrast with the conventional skills-assessment 
approaches, the motions generated by the expert in the loop 
provide a suitable reference, to which the performance of the 
trainee could be compared and relatively assessed. This 
relative assessment allows for real-time evaluation of the 
trainee’s performance, with no need for any a priori 
knowledge about the task trajectories for use as the 
evaluation reference. 
Taking the advantage of the real-time relative skills-
assessment approach proposed in [7], the authors take a 
further step by proposing a real-time expertise-oriented 
surgical training system. “Expertise-oriented” refers to 
providing the trainees with specialized training adaptively 
specified for them according to their level of proficiency. 
For example, novice trainees should receive haptic VF 
cueing on their hands, guiding them along the right path of 
the operation; while trainees with sufficient level of 
expertise do not need any VF cueing, but they can receive 
haptic force reflected back from the patient side which 
allows the trainees to get acquainted with the range of forces 
applied to the surgical instruments in the patient’s body. 
For this purpose, we propose a Fuzzy Logic (FL) 
methodology to specify expertise-oriented training 
appropriate for each trainee. In addition to the appropriate 
level of training, the proposed FL approach also specifies the

Assisted Surgery

appropriate authority of the trainee over the task according 
to his/her level of expertise.  
FL is a powerful flexible tool, dealing with approximate 
reasoning; that enables vagueness, uncertainties, and 
subjectivity to be taken into account in the evaluation system 
[8], [9]. This flexibility makes FL appropriate for surgical 
skills evaluation criteria that might include somewhat 
subjective measures, such as relative comparisons between a 
trainee and an expert.  FL has been used in several studies to 
assess a trainee’s proficiency level [10 11- 121314]. However, none 
of them addresses the relative evaluation of the trainee’s 
proficiency compared to that of an expert. In addition, the 
FL approaches introduced in the literature do not address the 
expertise-oriented mode of training. 
II. DESIRED OBJECTIVES 
A dual-user teleoperated system enables concurrent 
performance of a surgical operation by an expert, while 
training a novice [7]. To allow for this, master robot #1 is 
manipulated by the expert, while the trainee manipulates 
master robot #2. In order to give both the operators some 
authority over the slave robot, the desired position for the 
slave robot is defined as an authority-based combination of 
the trajectories generated by the two operators [15] as 
follows: 


()=
	

()


()+
	
 
()


() (1) 
where 

 refers to the end-effector positions of the master 
robots (=

,

) or slave robot (=) and the subscript 
“” refers to the desired value of the parameter. 
	

 and 

	

 corresponds to the dominance factors specifying the 
authority of operators #1 and #2 over the task, where 

	

()+
	

(t)=1. The trainee’s dominance factor is 
adaptively adjusted by the proposed FL scheme according to 
two main factors: 1) the expertise level of the trainee, 2) the 
maximum allowable level of the trainee’s authority specified 
by the expert.   
The expert, who will mainly be performing the procedure, 
receives haptic feedback indicating the forces reflected back 
from the patient’s body. Therefore, the desired objective for 
operator #1, as in conventional teleoperation systems, can be 
defined as	



=

, where 


 and 

 correspond to 
operator #1’s hand force and the environment force 
respectively. In [7], the desired objective for the trainee, 
operator #2, was defined as: 




=
 
 (2) 
where 


 refers to operator #2’s hand force and the 
subscript “” refers to the desired value. In addition, 
 
 
corresponds to the force generated by a VF designed to 
guide the trainee along the right path of the surgery. The 
presence of an expert in the loop provides the opportunity to 
generate the VF according to the motions generated by the 
expert as the desired reference trajectory in an online 
fashion. For this purpose, the hand position of the 
expert,	


(), at each time, can be used to create a 
spherical VF, inside which the trainee is able to move his/her 
freely. As soon as the trainee starts to go beyond the sphere 
surface, force 
 
 is reflected to his/her hand by the VF 
modeled by impedance characteristics. The inner spherical 
free region, created at 


() with radius	!
 
, allows the 
trainee’s hand to moves freely as long as it has a magnitude 
position error of less than !

y and z directions. 
In this paper, we propose an expertise-oriented training for 
a trainee, rather than providing the pure VF haptic cueing 

 
. For this purpose, the definition of the desired objective 
for the trainee is proposed as follows:

while at each time only one of them can take a non-zero 
value. 7
 
 and 7

 will be adaptively adjusted by the 
proposed FL scheme in real-time according to the 
proficiency level of the trainee. For example, if the FL 
recognizes the trainee as a novice, then 7

while if the trainee at some point is recognized as having 
attained expert status, then 7

=1. 
III. THE FUZZY INTERFACE DESIGN 
The proposed FL-based assessment will be used to specify 
the authority level of the trainee over the task, in addition to 
the appropriate level of training according to the trainee’s 
expertise level. In order to quantify the trainee’s expertise 
level, skills-assessment metrics from the literature are used: 
total path length, motion smoothness [16]-[17] and VF force 
effect metrics proposed by the authors in [7]. Having the 
advantage of an expert-in-the-loop through the dual-user 
framework, the quantified skills metrics calculated for both 
the trainee and the expert can be used to derive a relative 
measurement for the trainee’s performance compared to that 
of the expert. For this purpose, a comparative measure 
introduced in [7] is used to derive the relative measure 
between the trainee’s and the expert’s performance as 
follows: 
	8

()=1?:
;


()?;


()
;


()+;


()
: (5) 
where ;


and ;


 refer to absolute skills-assessment metrics 
for the expert and the trainee, respectively. The absolute 
skills metrics,	;, could be any of the gold-standard metrics 
used in the literature [1618-192021], three of which are used in this 
paper: total path length, motion smoothness and VF force 
effect metrics. The FL scheme will utilizes a combination of 
the three metrics to decide on the proficiency level of the 
trainee. Note that the structure of the proposed FL scheme 
allows for replacing/adding other metrics, if desired.  
5903
 
The proficiency level of a user is categorized into 4 
divisions: 1) Beginner, 2) Intermediate, 3) Advanced, and 4) 
Skilled (BIAS). Moving from a beginner trainee to a skilled 
trainee, the FL scheme should increase the trainee’s 
(operator #2’s) authority level over the task, of course to a 
maximum level,	

<=%
	
, specified by the expert surgeon in 
the loop (operator #1). In addition, the FL scheme should 
provide a beginner trainee, compared to an 
intermediate/advanced trainee, with smaller VF 
boundaries,	!
 
, to constrain the trainee’s freedom and to 
guide him/her more firmly along the right path of the 
procedure. Moving more towards the upper bound of the 
proficiency level: “skilled”, the FL scheme should provide a 
smaller amount of VF to the trainee, while a skilled trainee 
should receive, rather than the haptic guidance cueing	
 
, 
haptic feedback 

 applied by the patient’s body to the 
instrument tool to train him/her on the range of forces at the 
slave side. 
Therefore, the inputs for the FL scheme will be the 
quantified skills metrics normalized by (5) into the range 
[0,1] and the output will be the trainee’s authority level and 
the appropriate training force level/mode for the trainee. In 
order to fulfill the desired requirements for the training 
system, the following fuzzy rules are proposed: 
 If the user is Beginner, then: 
 Decrease his/her authority over the task significantly 
 Decrease the VF’s boundaries significantly 
 If the user is Intermediate, then: 
 Slightly increase his/her authority over the task 
 Slightly increase the VF’s boundaries 
 If the user is Advanced, then: 
 Increase his/her authority over the task considerably 
 Increase the VF’s boundaries significantly, up to a 
level that does not interfere with his/her motions 
anymore.  
 If the user is Skilled, then: 
 Increase his/her authority over the task significantly, 
up to the max allowable level, 

<=%
	
, specified by the 
expert surgeon in the loop 
 Provide him/her with the haptic feedback from the 
slave side 
In order to design the FL scheme, the MATLAB Fuzzy 
Logic Toolbox is used. To fuzzify the relative measure for 
each of the three skills-assessment metrics, “generalized 
bell-shaped” and “Gaussian curve” membership functions 
are used. Note that using (5), the relative skills metrics will 
have the range [0-1], without regard to the values of the 
absolute skills metrics, total path length, motion smoothness 
and VF force effect. The Membership Function (MF) 
designed for the relative skills-assessment metrics is shown 
in Fig. 1. The FL uses the same MF for all three metrics. In 
addition, the “triangular-shaped” and “trapezoidal-shaped” 
membership functions are used for the purpose of 
defuzzification at the output. The resulting output surfaces 
corresponding to the inputs are shown in Fig. 2. It should be 
noted that, since the proposed Fuzzy Interface System (FIS) 
has three inputs, one of the inputs should be fixed for the 
purpose of 3D representation. Therefore, the output surfaces, 
shown in Fig. 2, are plotted with respect to two of the FIS 
inputs, while the third one is set to a fixed value. 
 
Fig. 1: Degree of membership with respect to the normalized skills 
metric for the trainee relative to that of the expert  
The MFs pattern at both the inputs and the outputs could 
be even more precisely designed, by comparing/evaluating 
the skills metrics based on real data acquired from a number 
of subjects with a wide range of expertise levels. However, 
this requires an extensive users study to collect and analyze 
data from a wide range of subjects, which is beyond the 
scope of this paper and will be the focus of future work.  
A major advantage of the proposed FIS is that, with an 
expert in the loop, it can specify the trainee’s proficiency 
level relative to that of the expert in real-time, and decide on 
the appropriate level/mode of the training required according 
to the trainee’s proficiency level. The relative skills 
assessment eliminates the need to have any a priori 
knowledge about the surgical path, to be used as the 
reference trajectory for the purpose of skills evaluation.

that since the FIS receives 3 inputs, one input should be set to a fixed value for the purpose of 3D representation of the output surfaces with respect 
to the inputs. TAL: Trainee’s Authority Level, VFR: Virtual Fixture Radius, EFF: Environment Force Factor, NMS: Normalized Motion

IV. CONTROL METHODOLOGY AND STABILITY ANALYSIS 
To satisfy the desired objectives given by (1)-(4) for the 
system, an impedance controller is used [22]. We define 
three impedance surfaces as the desired closed-loop system 
as given in (6); and an impedance controller is used to 
satisfy these impedance surfaces.

To investigate the stability of closed-loop teleoperated 
system, the small-gain theorem is used. The system stability 
is analyzed for the case of a constant communication delays 
between the slave robot and the master robots. In this paper, 
it is assumed that the expert and the trainee are located at the 
same site, communicating via a delay-free network.

V. EXPERIMENTS 
In order to evaluate the behavior of the proposed FL-based 
training framework, experiments were conducted. The 
experimental setup, shown in Fig. 4, consists of two 
customized Quanser Haptic Wands as the master robots, and 
one Mitsubishi PA10-7C robot with a da Vinci tool attached 
at the tip as the slave robot [26].

The conducted experiment consists of three phases, each 
focusing on a different scenario, to investigate various 
aspects of the framework. The master robots were 
manipulated by two operators, one as an expert and the other 
as a trainee. In the first phase, between 0 and 45 
sec, the expert, operator #1, was asked to execute a 
trajectory with his master robot. At the same time, in order 
to simulate a skillful performance for the trainee (operator 
#2), she was asked to replicate the hand trajectories 
generated by the expert. In the second phase of the 
experiment, between 45 and 100 , while the 
expert was accomplishing his task, the trainee was asked to 
keep her master robot firmly at a fixed position, without 
regarding the trajectories generated by the expert as well as 
the forces exerted on her hand by the VF. This allows 
simulating unskilled behavior for the trainee, as her 
performance is very different from the desired reference 
trajectory. Finally, in the third phase occurring from 
100 to 140, the trainee was asked to let the VF 
guide her hand through the desired trajectory generated in 
real-time by the expert in the loop, without giving her any 
knowledge about the desired path in advance.  
In this experiment, the VF was characterized by a spring 
with the stiffness 40d

. In addition, the maximum 
allowable authority level for the trainee, 

<=%
	
, was set to 1 
by the expert, permitting the trainee to receive full authority 
over the task if she is recognized by the FIS as skillful. The 
results are given in Fig. 5-Fig. 8. 
Fig. 5 shows the normalized skills metrics calculated for 
the trainee relative to those for the expert, where NTP: 
Normalized Total Path Length, NMS: Normalized Motions 
Smoothness, NVFE: Normalized VF Force Effect. As can be 
seen in this figure, all three metrics show a high level of 
expertise level for the trainee in the first phase of the 
experiment, where she behaved as a skilled trainee. In the 
second phase, as soon as the trainee started to deviate from 
the desired reference trajectory without paying any attention 
to the VF force cues provided to her, the skills metrics start 
to decrease and ultimately reach zero, referring to a fully 
unskilled trainee. In the third phase, where the trainee allows 
the VF to guide her along the desired reference trajectory, 
since the trainee is moving along a path with a similar 
profile to that of the expert, NTPL and NMS show an 
increase for the trainee’s skills level. However, the 
interesting point is that, although the trainee’s hand is 
travelling on the right path, NVFE does not show any 
improvement in her performance, compared to that in the 
second phase. The reason is that this metric evaluates the 
trainee’s performance according to the VF force guiding the 
trainee. As long as the trainee is not capable of generating 
the right path on her own, which results in the VF cueing to 
guide her, this metric refers to an inadequate level of 
expertise for her. Therefore, this metric is suitable for 
distinguishing between two “on-the-right-path” trajectories 
generated by the trainee to decide if the right trajectory has 
been the result of high proficiency level of the trainee or of 
the effect of VF guidance cueing. 
According to the normalized relative skills metrics, the 
FIS has specified the authority level of the trainee in real-
time, as shown in Fig. 6. As can be seen, in the first phase of 
the experiment, the trainee was given the maximum 
authority level by the FIS, as she behaved as a skillful 
trainee. However, in both the second and the third phases, 
she was specified as a novice, resulting in zero authority 
level for her over the slave robot.  
In addition to adjustment of the authority level for the 
trainee according to her level of expertise, the FIS also 
specifies the level/mode of the haptic-based training required 
for her. Fig. 7 shows, 


, the training force exerted on the 
trainee’s hand generated by the FIS; 

, the environment 
force at the slave side; and 
 
, the VF guidance force. As 
can be seen, in the first phase of the experiment, the trainee 
feels the environment force on her hand, i.e. 




, which 
resulted from the high level of expertise she showed. In the 
second and third phases, due to the inadequate proficiency 
level of the trainee, the VF cuing mode was activated. 
Therefore, the trainee was not able to feel the environment 
force anymore, but receiving the VF force on her hand to 
guide her along the right path. Comparing the VF force 
generated in the second and the third phases, an interesting 
point is the difference between the level of the VF forces. 
Although in both phases the trainee received the VF force, 
she received a considerable less amount of VF force on her 
hand in the third phase, compared to the second. The reason 
is that in the third phase she was letting the VF force guiding 
her, to generate less deviation from the desired trajectory, 
rather than resist the VF guidance as in the second phase.  
Finally Fig. 8 shows the trajectories travelled by the 
expert, 


; by the trainee, 


; and by the slave robot, 

. 
As can be seen, in phase II and III, the slave robot 
completely tracked the expert’s trajectory without regard to 
the trainee’s trajectory, as she was recognized by the system 
as a novice, setting her authority level to zero.
