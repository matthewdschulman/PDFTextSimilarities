Abstract— In this paper, a novel approach of SEM calibration
based on non-linear minimization process is presented. The
SEM calibration for the intrinsic parameters are achieved by
an iterative non-linear optimization algorithm which minimize
the registration error between the current estimated position
of the pattern and its observed position. The calibration can be
achieved by one image and multiple images of calibration pat-
tern. Perspective and parallel projection models are addressed
in this approach. The experimental results show the efﬁciency
and accuracy of the proposed method.
I. INTRODUCTION
Scanning electron microscope (SEM) is an electron mi-
croscope where a focused beam of electrons is used to scan
the surface of a specimen. This is an essential instrument
to display, measure and manipulate the micro and nano-
structure with a micrometers or nanometers accuracy. When
the task requires the computation of metric information from
the acquired 2D images, the calibration of the SEM is an
important issue to be considered.
Since the structure of a scanning electron microscope is
very different from the structure of an optical microscope,
it became apparent that novel image analysis, geometrical
projection models and calibration processes would be nec-
essary in order to extract accurate information from the
SEM images. In earlier studies, photogrammetric analysis
of SEM has been considered by several authors [1],[6]. The
projection model relates a three-dimensional (3D) point on
a specimen in the observed space to its projection in the
two-dimensional (2D) image. Previous studies consider that
at low magniﬁcation, perspective projection model can be
applied because the observed area and electron beam sweep
angle are both large. At higher magniﬁcation, the center
of projection is usually regarded at inﬁnity so the parallel
projection model is assumed. However, the practical limit
between the choice of perspective projection and parallel
projection model is not clear. Some experiments [4],[16]
show that parallel projection is assumed at magniﬁcation
of 1000 and higher. [9] have concluded that the use of
parallel projection depends on the desired accuracy for the
calculation of position of a point on the specimen. Another
important issue in calibration is distortion, which contains
spatial distortion (static distortion) and time-dependent drift
(temporally-varying distortion). The drift is mainly due to
the accumulation of electrons on the surface of the observed

specimen. In this paper, we assume that it is compensated
by [17]. Several papers [11],[16] ignore distortion and con-
sider only a pure projection model. A few authors [6],[8] con-
sider this with parametric models. Spatial distortion includ-
ing radial distortion and spiral distortion are introduced in
their geometric model. In [4], the distortion removal function
is determined before the calibration stage. In this method,
good guesses are required in the measurement to ensure the
accuracy. Recently, a landmark-based 3D calibration strategy
[15] is proposed applying a 3D micrometre-sized reference
structure with the shape of a cascade slope-step pyramid.
The fabrication of this special 3D reference structure is an
important issue. Since different scales of magniﬁcation are
needed in some applications, [13] considers the modeling
magniﬁcation-continuous parameters of the static distortion
and the projection of the SEM.
In this paper, we address the mentioned calibration prob-
lems of SEM: projection models and spatial distortions. A
novel approach of SEM calibration involving a full scale
non-linear optimization is proposed. The pose (ie, position
and orientation of the calibration pattern frame in the sensor
frame) computation and SEM calibration are considered
simultaneously. The formulation is simple and versatile. An
iterative algorithm has been developed to acquire accurate
results of calibration. The paper is organized as follows. First,
geometrical projection model is described in Section II. Sec-
tion III introduces the principle of calibration process. The
experimental results at various magniﬁcations that validate
the approach are shown in Section IV .
II. CONSIDERED PROJECTION MODEL FOR A SEM
In this paper we shall focus on the geometrical cali-
bration of the system projection model. Our ﬁnal goal is
to achieve visual servoing tasks for object positioning and
manipulation. Therefore for simplicity issues we decide to
consider classical projection models. Whereas such model as
a clear physical meaning when considering optical devices,
this is no longer the case with a SEM. Nevertheless, for the
targeted applications, considering classical projection model
has proved to be sufﬁcient [6] (such assertion may no longer
be true for, eg, structure characterization). It is however
important to determine the nature of the projection model
to be considered: parallel and perspective models.
The goal of the calibration process is to determine the
set of parameters which deﬁne the relationship between the
3D coordinates of an object point on the observed specimen
and its projection in the image plane (such parameters that
include, in an optical system, the focal length, the dimension

of pixel, the location of principle points on the image plan
are named intrinsic parameters).
Previous studies [8],[9] propose to consider two projec-
tion models: perspective projection (central projection) and
parallel projection (typically orthographic projection). The
perspective projection, where objects are projected towards
a point referred to as the center of projection, is widely
used in classical camera models, such as the pinhole camera
and the digital camera. The parallel projection corresponds
to a perspective projection with an inﬁnite focal length.
The projection rays and the image plane is perpendicular
in parallel projection model. We shall consider these two
models within a multi-image non-linear calibration process.

the observed object expressed in the sensor frame (located
on the projection center). x = (x;y; 1) is the coordinates
of its projection in the image plane expressed in normalized
coordinate (ie, in meter). We have [12]

allel. The coordinates of a 2D point x = (x;y) corresponds

C. Image distortion

distortion is radial distortion. Considering the distortion, the

. Usually, to
compensate for the radial distortion, one or two coefﬁcients
are enough. It has to be noted that in SEM image such
distortion appears to be very small.
Another issue that can be considered is the skewness
between the x- and y-axis. In this case we have:

III. NON-LINEAR CALIBRATION PROCESS
Calibration is an old research area that received much
attention since the early 70’s, ﬁrst in the photogramme-
try community (eg, [2]) then in the computer vision and
robotics communities (eg, [5], [18], [19], etc.). Most of the
approaches consider the calibration issue as a registration
problem that consists in determining the relationship between
3D coordinates of points and their 2D projections in the
image plane. These 3D features are usually a part of a
calibration pattern (sometime a 3D calibration rig) and the
position of these features in a world frame have to be known
with a very good accuracy. Performing the calibration leads
to the estimation of the intrinsic camera parameters (image
center, focal length, distortion) but also, as a by-product,
extrinsic camera parameters (ie, the pose).
Various techniques exist to achieve the calibration. Among
these techniques, full-scale non-linear optimization tech-
niques (introduced within the photogrammetry commu-
nity [2]) have proved to be very efﬁcient. They consist
in minimizing the error between the observation and the
back-projection of the model. Minimization is handled using
5192
numerical iterative algorithms such as Newton-Raphson or
Levenberg-Marquartd.
A. Calibration
As stated the goal is to minimize the error between points
extracted from the image x

p
and the projection of the model
of the calibration pattern for given model parameters (both
intrinsic parameters and pose) x
p
(r;).
We deﬁne the error  = e
>
e between the desired state of
image feature x

p
and the current state x
p
(r;):
e = x
p
(r;) x

p
(11)
wherex
p
(r;) is computed using equation (2) or (5). To min-
imize this cost function, we specify an exponential decrease
of the error:
_ e = e (12)
where is a proportional coefﬁcient. In (12), _ e can be simply
computed from the time variation of _ x
p
which is given by:
_ x
p

(13)
where r represent the (virtual) sensor position along the
minimization trajectory (translation and rotation), v =

dt
is the sensor velocity during the minimization. Rewrite (13):
_ x

where V =

is the image Jacobian, it is
given by:

Combining (14) and (12), we ﬁnally get:
V = J

) (16)
where J
+
p
is the pseudo inverse of matrix J
p
and V being
the parameters increment computed at each iteration of this
minimization process.
B. Multi-image calibration
In practice, the intrinsic parameters are usually obtained by
different viewpoints of the calibration pattern from the same
camera. The optimization scheme requires the computation
of the position of calibration pattern and a common set
of intrinsic parameters. In that case the global error to be
minimized is given by

C. Nonlinear optimization
In the nonlinear minimization process, the optimization
algorithm is an important issue. The general idea of min-
imizing a nonlinear function is to successively update the
parameters such that the value of cost function decreases
at each iteration as speciﬁed by equation (12). The Gauss-
Newton method is usually used in nonlinear optimization as
presented in equation (16).
Particularly, the measured values are small in the SEM
imaging (point coordinates are expressed in micrometer (m)
and nanometer (nm)). Several numerical problems are then
induced into the optimization algorithms. For example, these
tiny values causes rank deﬁciency of Jacobian matrix J
p
.
Sometimes the computation of equation (16) is impossible.
In this case, the Levenberg-Marquardt method is considered:
V = (J
>
p
J
p
+I)
 1
J
>
p
e (21)
where I is a identity matrix and  is a coefﬁcient whose
typical value ranges from 0.001 or 0.0001. With modifying
, the algorithm is set to adapt the input data and to avoid
numerical problems.

IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
The SEM microscope that has been used to validate the
developed calibration method is a Carl Zeiss AURIGA 60
(Fig. 1). It provides a wide magniﬁcation ranges from 12
to 1000k. Within the SEM a 6DoF platform is available,
including 360° continuous rotation and tilt from -15° to 70°.
A multi-scale planar calibration pattern (see Fig. 2) is used
in the calibration procedure. It is a hierarchy of chessboard

Fig. 3. Calibration images (a)800 with 20°rotation (b)1500 with 4°tilt
grids where size of each square are of 25m, 10m, 5m,
2m and 1m. Acquired image size is 1024768 pixels.
Several sets of calibration images (Fig. 3) have been ac-
quired within the SEM with different magniﬁcations ranging
300 up to 10k. Each group (with a given magniﬁcation)
contents 7 to 9 images of the pattern acquired from various
poses with rotation around Z axis ranging from 0° to 40°,
and tilt from 0° to 8°.
The proposed calibration procedure has been implemented
with the ViSP library [14]. Considering the chessboard
shape of our calibration pattern, we have used the OpenCV
chessboard corners detector in order to obtain a precise
localization of each corner. A linear algorithm has been
considered to have a ﬁrst approximation of the calibration
parameters [20]. The multi-image iterative non-linear mini-
mization method for calibration, using both perspective and
projection model, is then used. The intrinsic parameters are
then computed by minimizing the residual error between the
projection of the pattern for the current estimated pose and
the observed one.
A. Minimization process and algorithm behavior
To illustrate the behavior and performance of the proposed
algorithm, we consider here the calibration of the SEM using
a parallel projection model and without adding any distortion
parameters.
In this experiment, the SEM magniﬁcation has been set
to 2000, the size of each pattern square is of 5m. Eight
images of the calibration pattern have been acquired from
eight poses with rotation from 0° up to 20° and tilt from
0° up to 8° and used in the calibration process. The gain
 in equation (12) in the algorithm is set to 0.4. Fig. 4(a)
shows the residual error computed at each iteration of the
minimization process. The evolution of intrinsic parameters
p
x
and p
y
is shown in Fig. 4(b). The residual error and the
intrinsic parameters converge quickly even thought the value

set of extrinsic parameters (estimated sensor poses) during
the minimization process. It can be noted that, as expected,
motion along theZ axes is not observable using the parallel
projection model (in equation (26), the elements in the third
column of the interaction matrix which corresponds to the
Jacobian of translation on Z axis are indeed null).
B. Projection models
Another experiment aims to test two projection models
that can be possibly considered for the calibration of a
SEM. To compare the performance with different scales, four
magniﬁcations are considered: 500, 1000, 2000 and
5000. Note that it is suggested in the literature [4],[16] that
perspective projection can be applied for a magniﬁcation up
to 1000 whereas parallel projection should be considered
for higher magniﬁcation. Table I shows the estimated cali-
brated intrinsic parameters p
x
, p
y
, u
0
and v
0
, the estimated
distance Z
1
between sensor and calibration pattern (for the
ﬁrst image) and the residual errorkek in pixel. In all the
case the algorithm converges and the registration error is
less than 0.5 pixel per point which correspond to the noise
level in corner extraction. It is quite clear from the estimation
of parametersp
x
andp
y
that, with the perspective projection
model, intrinsic parameters are inconsistent. Nevertheless the
ratio p
x
=(Z
1
M) is almost constant (see Table II) which
conﬁrms the fact that the difference between p
x
(or p
y
) and
object depth is not observable. This motivates the choice
of the parallel projection model for future visual servoing
experiments despite the fact that depth motion are not
observable.
Table II shows the p

tion and p
(x;y)

approximately a constant value in the two projection models.

We have tested a wide range of magniﬁcations from
300 to 10k considering parallel projection model. Results
are shown in Table III. The intrinsic parameters through
magniﬁcations are shown in Fig. 6. The ratio between the
computed intrinsic parameters p

and magniﬁcation M
is almost constant: as expected a quasi linear relation exists

and magniﬁcation as shown in Fig. 6. It as to
be noted that the residual errorkek is slightly more important
for low magniﬁcation meaning that parallel projection model
is less appropriate at low magniﬁcation (300, 500) which
conﬁrms earlier report [16]. kek also increases at high
magniﬁcation but the reason is that at high magniﬁcation
the extraction of corner position on the calibration pattern
used in our experiment could not be as accurate as that at
low magniﬁcation.
C. Distortion issues
Finally, an experiment has been realized to test the poten-
tial effects of distortion. Three magniﬁcations are considered
in this experiments: 500, 2000 and 5000. To compare
the performance of calibration with and without distortion
parameters, all the factors (gain, coefﬁcient in Levenberg-
Marquardt optimization, etc.) in the algorithm are ﬁxed.

V. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, a simple and efﬁcient method of SEM
calibration has been addressed. A global multi-image non-
linear minimization process that minimizes the residual er-
ror between the projection of the calibration pattern and
its observation in the image was considered. The precise
intrinsic parameters as well as the position of the sensor with
respect to the pattern are computed. The choice of the parallel
projection model has been validated for SEM images. The
spatial distortion parameters (skewness, radial distortion and
spiral distortion) are such insigniﬁcant in our experiments
that can be eliminated.
