Abstract—Thispaperintroducesaposition-basedcompliance
control algorithm that can be implemented in a lower extremity
exoskeleton-supported paraplegia walking task, in which upper
body has to be utilized to maintain the overall balance. In
order to reduce the upper body effort required during the
task, the controller is designated to be capable of managing the
position/forcetrade-offinconjunctionwithanactiveadmittance
regulator scheme. In the case of no force errors, the controller
prioritizes position tracking in a way to achieve walking
support. Once the force error increases (e.g., ground reaction
force peaks, unexpected disturbances, stepping on an object,
etc.) the position reference is updated in accordance with
the force constraints and active admittance characteristics. By
the virtue of this strategy, the human-robot system exhibits
enhanced environmental interaction capabilities; therefore, the
subject can maintain the overall balance with relatively less
upper body effort while walking. Implementing the proposed
method, we conducted robot-assisted walking experiments on 4
able-bodied subjects with different body mass index levels and
genders. Subjects were instructed to be in passive mode. In
addition, walking with severe obstacles was also experimented
on a single able-bodied subject. In conclusion, the proposed
method enabled us to yield enhanced walking performance
comparing to classical rigid position control scheme; indicating
that it could potentially introduce a compliant locomotion

I. INTRODUCTION
Comparing to their wheeled counterparts, robotic lower
body exoskeletons possess clear advantages in improving the
health and life quality of non-ambulatory patients [1]. Indi-
viduals with wheeled assistive equipment are reported to be
prone to pressure sores and related diseases [2]. Furthermore,
such devices may not provide an overall ambulatory support
within the presence of uneven surfaces and narrow pathways.
In response to this matter, engineers from Ekso Bionics
(http://www.eksobionics.com) presented eLegs, which was
developed as an end-result of Kazerooni’s contributions [3].
Following a similar trend, researchers introduced ReWalk, an
electrically-actuated lower body exoskeleton with clinically
demonstrated assistive capabilities [4]. In another examples,
Kagawa and Uno proposed WPAL, a gait assist device that
can be single-handedly worn from a wheelchair [5]. Sankai
et al. engineered HAL, an intention-driven exoskeleton [6].

Most of these devices are experimented on individuals with
no inherent walking ability and they utilize the human-
wearer’s upper body motion via auxiliary tools, e.g., canes.
Above-mentioned devices appear to be successful attempts
for the paraplegia support and they are in the process of
commercial development. Considering the target task, they
naturally rely on stiff position tracking schemes. While
remarkably useful in its own right, this approach may not
provide a satisfactory and comfortable walking experience;
the human-wearer may face difﬁculties while the exoskeleton
system has noncompliant contact with the ground, e.g.,
touch-down of a swing leg or stepping on an uneven object.
Therefore, it is anticipated that a compliant exoskeleton may
provide a relatively more feasible support for a wearer.
Addressing these issues, Caldwell et al. underlined the
importance of compliance in their design and control proce-
dures [7]. Veneman et al. introduced LOPES, an impedance-
controlled exoskeleton [8]. Neuhaus et al. built an exoskele-
ton system, called Mina, powered via electrical actuators
that can be compliantly driven with a position/force control
strategy [9]; however, in-depth discussions regarding the
compliance control are not disclosed.
In the light of these contributions, we built an electrically-
actuated and actively-compliant whole body exoskeleton pro-
totype, named TTI-Exo, which shares the common ground
with [7]–[9], in terms of control philosophy. In our approach,
the motion generator ﬁrstly synthesizes target position refer-
ences in a physically-viable manner. Ground reaction force
references are also generated in accordance with the target
motion references. Utilizing the force measurements and
force references, the controller then generates joint displace-
ments that correspond to force error, via Jacobi transpose and
virtual admittance blocks. In addition to position constraints,
these joint displacements are fed-back to local servos, so
that the position/force trade-off is managed in a compliant
manner. As the result, exoskeleton-based paraplegia support
task can potentially be achieved more comfortably for the
wearer; he/she needs to exert comparatively less upper body
effort to maintain the overall balance while the human-robot
system is interacting with the environment.
The contributions of this paper can be categorized in
two fractions: i) An actively-compliant locomotion control
algorithm is proposed for the exoskeleton-based paraplegia
walking support task. The controller introduces the posi-
tion/force trade-off management in a compliant manner, and
therefore, hypothetically outperforms classical stiff position
control strategy in terms of reduced upper body effort. To
the authors’ knowledge, this paper reports one of the ﬁrst

these phases appear to be delay periods between sequential single support

this task, x-axis CoM position (X
c
), upper body pitch ori-
entation (), x-axis and z-axis foot trajectories (X
f
,Z
f
) are
synthesized via polynomial interpolation, in a way to create
smooth and continuous time-varying trajectories. These par-
ticular 4 inputs are determined to be convenient in our 4-DoF
system for the paraplegia walking support task. Boundary
conditions are carefully set by considering the desired stride
length, mean target forward velocity, single/double support
time periods. Likewise,X
f
andZ
f
trajectories are generated
to have zero velocity and acceleration at the moment of
touch-down to reduce possible impacts. The motion gener-
ator makes sure that single/double support phases are tied
seamlessly, so that trajectories are always continuous both in
position, velocity and acceleration levels. It is also possible
to alter motion generation parameters (stride length, mean
forward velocity, single/double support time periods) in real-
time, so as to make sure the human subject comfortably
receives walking support.
Since only static equilibrium is considered, it is the
human-wearer upper body motion that guarantees the overall
dynamic balance is maintained, in a similar manner as per-
formed in [3]–[5], [9]. Due to the inherent underactuation in
TTI-Exo, CoM height (Z
c
) and swing foot orientation could
not be imposed as inputs in our motion generator. Instead,
(X
c
,,X
f
,Z
f
) are analyzed to be relatively signiﬁcant and
selected as inputs for our 4-DoF system. They are indicated
on the CAD model in Fig. 2. Moreover, motion generation
parameters are carefully selected and trajectories are double-
conﬁrmed in kinematics simulations, so as to keep CoM
height within a small range and make sure the swing foot
leaves the ground with toe-off, then touches down with a ﬂat
orientation to avoid possible impacts (see Fig. 3).
GRF references are computed as below, where m is the
overall mass (the wearer+exoskeleton), g is the gravitational
acceleration. ref underscript refers to referential values; 1
and 2 additions in the underscripts respectively associate the
related parameters to left and right feet. Note that eqs. (2)
and (3) are arranged for left foot single support phase and
an identical approach can be followed for right foot single
support phase. Equation (4) stands for double support phase.

references are naturally set to zero (eq. (3)). During double
support phases, there is no horizontal motion. Because of this
reason, horizontal force references are set to zero. Vertical

v
does not necessarily associate active compliance with
a force feedback strategy. In V AC method, both position
and force constraints are simultaneously processed, so as
to automatically manage the position/force trade-off via
virtual admittance coefﬁcients. For instance, if the force error
suddenly gets bigger within the presence of a disturbance,
V AC generates q
v
term to decrease stiffness in a way to
reduce force error. As soon as the disturbance vanishes,
force error diminishes and q
v
converges to zero. In that
case, the joint turns back to its initial stiffness and continue
strict joint position tracking. In other words, the joint gets
softer if only force error appears; apart from this situation,
it always keeps its initial stiffness for strict position control
which is required for the task. The degree of getting softer,
i.e., position/force trade-off, is software-controlled via virtual
admittance coefﬁcients. Fig. 5 illustrates both stiff position
control and V AC strategies, in which touch-down impact is
particularly examined.
B. Compensation Schemes: Friction, Coriolis and Gravity
In the proposed method, coriolis & centrifugal and gravity
terms are computed via ﬂoating-base inverse dynamics and
added as feedforward torques only for the robot side (not for
the wearer). Furthermore, inherent joint friction hysteresis
(stiction and viscous friction) model is previously identiﬁed,
then corresponding friction compensation torque is also
added as feedforward terms [10]. 
cg
and 
fr
in Fig. 4(a)
refer to these terms. Partial dynamic compensation and fric-
tion compensation allow us to achieve position tracking with
comparatively lower servo PD gains, so that the inherent joint
stiffness could be reduced. This creates certain advantages in
terms of human-robot interaction and enhanced mechanical
performance.
V. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND EVALUATIONS
In order to gain insights regarding the efﬁciency of Virtual
Admittance Controller method over the conventional stiff po-
sition control strategy, we conduct robot-supported walking
experiments with the help of 4 able-bodied volunteer subjects
whose data are summarized in Table I. Experiments are con-
ducted on a treadmill and the participants are instructed to be

IMU sensor is ﬁrmly attached to the wearer’s chest to measure horizontal
acceleration and pitch axis torso angle rate change variation. Treadmill
handhold is covered with force sensing strips to measure the upper body
force exerted by the wearer’s arms. Refer to the multimedia attachment to
view the experiments [13]. Note that force sensing units at the feet soles

in passive mode. On this matter, we would like to highlight
the fact that subjects can neither alter nor withstand the
designated walking motion, as the exoskeleton is principally
position controlled in both V AC and conventional methods.
Two types of experiments are executed: i) Experiment #1:
Flat surface walking; ii) Experiment #2: Irregular surface
walking. In order to perform a solid comparison, both
Experiment #1 and Experiment #2 are executed twice; with
the proposed V AC method and with the conventional position
control method [3]–[5]. Refer to the multimedia attachment,
to view various additional scenes from the experiments
conducted with Subject #2 [13].
All experiments are conducted on a treadmill. Fig. 6
shows the hardware setup during the experimentation period
of Subject #2. As illustrated in Fig. 5, conventional stiff
position control scheme is unable to handle environmental
interactions adroitly, such as touch-down impacts. Walking
gaits that are controlled with the stiff control strategy is prone
to undesired torso angle ﬂuctuations and extra horizontal
movements; making the wearer exert more and more effort to
maintain the overall balance. Therefore, their arms may have
to generate larger forces. On the other hand, the proposed
V AC method overcomes this environmental interaction issue
in a compliant manner; aforementioned undesired motions
are observed in relatively fewer amounts.
To quantitatively corroborate our hypothesis, we collect
horizontal acceleration and pitch angle rate change from
each subjects’ upper body via an IMU unit. Furthermore,
treadmill handhold is covered with force sensing strips to
measure the upper body force exerted by the wearer’s arms.
Acquired data are low pass ﬁltered and trends are removed.
All the processed data give us certain clues to quantitatively
evaluate exoskeleton-based walking support performance. If
the wearer exerts relatively less force from his/her arms,
1358
and experiences less horizontal acceleration/pitch angle rate
variations, we may categorize that case as a favorable case.
Therefore, the proposed method, V AC, is compared with the
conventionally used [3]–[5] stiff position control, by using
the aforementioned upper body motion data.
Walking parameters are designated by considering the
subject’s leg lengths. For instance, single and double support
time, forward velocity and stride length parameters are
respectively designated as 1.2 [s], 0.12 [s], 0.7 [km/h] and
26 [cm] in the case of Subject #1. Having designated the
walking parameters for a speciﬁc subject, she/he performed
all the experiments with the same gait. In other words, gait
remains the same in all the experiments for a given subject.
A. Experiment #1: Flat Surface Walking
In accordance with the above methodology, this exper-
iment is conducted on 4 able-bodied subjects. Results on
Subject #1 is depicted in Fig. 7. Solid purple and green
lines symbolize variations, respectively associated with V AC
strategy and conventional stiff position control strategy.
In Fig. 7(a), arithmetic average of 5 consecutive right foot
GRF peaks are normalized via total weight and displayed
both for V AC (purple) and conventional (green) methods.
It may be observed that V AC method provides sufﬁcient
compliance while the exoskeleton is interacting with the
environment, so that GRF levels are greatly reduced for about
65%. Therefore, comparing to the conventional method,
V AC may provide exoskeleton-supported walking in a more
physically-viable manner.
With the help of compliant walking support, a V AC-based
controlled exoskeleton requires comparatively less upper
body motion effort. Keeping this in mind, horizontal torso
acceleration, torso pitch angle rate, and total force exerted by
arms variations are displayed in Fig. 7(b)-(c)-(d) to defend
this hypothesis. Examining these ﬁgures, such quantities
show certain amount of decreases while V AC is applied.
Table II sums up the complete results, in which percentage
decreases are given in terms of RMS (Root Mean Square).
As previously discussed, the proposed V AC method au-
tomatically manages the position/force trade-off; within the
presence of large force errors, it sacriﬁces joint tracking
through a period, until the disturbance that introduced force
error vanishes. Fig. 7(e) exhibits right leg knee joint tracking
performances. Analyzing this ﬁgure, we obtained perfect
joint tracking while the conventional method is used. V AC
method also provides a feasible tracking performance, except
touch-down instants which are indicated with blue circles.
During those instants, joint tracking error follows a trend
around 6 degrees. This appears to be the price to be paid for
compliant walking support. On the other hand, this is a very
affordable price; such tracking performance does not cause
any problem during walking. In the multimedia attachment,
we display both walking performances simultaneously, thus,
one can conﬁrm that possible motion differences between 2
walking experiments (with V AC and with conventional) are
completely negligible [13].

ﬁnds himself in an obligation to step on these blocks. Since
this experiment is rather risky, only Subject #2 is asked to
perform. Results are presented in Fig. 8, in which solid
purple and green lines point out the data afﬁliated with
V AC method and conventional method, respectively. Due
to space limitation, only horizontal torso acceleration, torso
pitch angle rate and total force exerted by arms are provided.

efﬁcient within the presence of irregularities on the surface.
Comparing to conventional position control, we obtained
%64 decrease in horizontal torso acceleration, %57 decrease
in torso pitch angle rate, and %43 decrease in total force
exerted by the subject’s arms. Judging by these results,
V AC method is able to provide physically viable walking
support even the subject has to step on obstacles. While the
exoskeleton is run on conventional method, the able-bodied
subject experiences severe difﬁculties when he is stepping
on wooden obstacles; he has to force himself in an utmost
level to retrieve the overall dynamic balance.
VI. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS
To conclude, we propose a motion generation method and
a controller scheme, which are uniﬁed on an active lower
body exoskeleton system for the robot-assisted paraplegia
walking support task. It is shown that the motion generator is
able to synthesize smooth, continuous and time-varying po-
sition references that are required for the task. The proposed
controller, Virtual Admittance Controller, is also validated to
be efﬁcient, as it introduces virtual admittance in each joint to
enhance environmental interaction capability. The controller
simultaneously processes both position and force constraints
while automatically managing the position/force trade-off.
Implementing the proposed method, exoskeleton-based
bipedal walking support experiments are conducted with
the help of 4 able-bodied human subjects. As the result,
the controller is able to handle external forces in a more
compliant and physically-viable manner, comparing to con-
ventional stiff position control. Additionally, irregular surface
walking experiments are conducted; an important case that is
not heavily investigated in the literature. The results of this
experiment also evaluated to be promising, indicating that
V AC has potentials to be utilized for the paraplegia walking
support task within the presence of obstacles on the surface.
In our future work, we conduct more experiments on
numerous able-bodied subjects with different BMI levels, so
as to cogently validate that the incorporation of compliance
minimizes the upper body effort in the exoskeleton-supported
walking task. Subsequently, clinical trials will be planned.
