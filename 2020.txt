Abstract - Whirligig beetle, claimed in the literature to be 
one of the highest measured for a thrust-generating apparatus 
within the animal kingdom, has evolved a series of propulsion 
strategies that may serve as a source of inspiration for 
designing highly efficient propulsive systems. First, a robotic 
platform was developed to test an energy-efficient propulsion 
mechanism inspired by the whirligig beetle. Second, a 
mathematical model for the robot was proposed to account for 
the fluid dynamics generated by the robotic swimming. Third, 
an optimal problem was formulated and solved for the 
propulsor and beating pattern design. The results indicated 
that soft middle, stiff end propulsor, and alternating, 
asymmetrical beating pattern will improve the propulsion 
efficiency for a swimming robot with four propulsors. Finally, 
simulation and experiments were conducted to further analyze 
the effect of beating pattern to the robotic propulsion efficiency. 
It was found that the oscillated body movement and S-shaped 
trajectory introduced by the optimal beating pattern would 
improve the propulsion efficiency for the designed robot.
    
 
?. INTRODUCTION 
Walking, flying, and swimming animals have long been 
an important source of inspiration for robotics[1]. What 
makes the swimming organisms a unique source for 
bio-inspiration is their effective propulsive mechanisms [2, 
3]. In this paper, we will propose an energy-efficient 
propulsion mechanism inspired by whirligig beetles, which 
were claimed in the literature to possess one of the most 
efficient thrust-generating apparatus within the animal 
kingdom [4]. Our group first discovered that the whirligig 
beetles' curved swimming trajectories gained energy 
efficiency over linear trajectories by alternating the ways the 
propulsors propelled [5]. Previous studies have concluded 
that whirligig beetles can swim at speeds of up to 44.5 body 
lengths/s with a maximum turning rate of 4428°/s and a 
maximum centripetal acceleration of 2.86 g [6]. In addition 
to the incredible speed, the insect is able to achieve a turning 
radius as small as 24% of the body length, and typically 84%

of energy devoted to swimming can be transformed into 
forward propulsion [7, 8]. Additionally, it has been found 
that whirligig beetles are able to attain high swimming 
speeds, while reducing drag due to their unique propulsor 
structures, morphology, and beating patterns [7, 9]. 
This paper will focus on bioinspired propulsor design 
and optimal beating pattern regulation to achieve efficient 
propulsion. To achieve these objectives, two optimization 
approaches for developing an energy-efficient propulsor and 
beating patterns were proposed and validated using a robotic 
platform designed and fabricated in our lab. A compliant 
propulsor with flexural rigidity determined by the stroke 
direction was proposed to realize a large area ratio between 
the power and recovery stroke and efficient utilization of 
fluid force. Finally, an energy efficient propulsion method 
was identified through beating pattern optimization and 
validated through simulation and experimental studies. 
?. BIOINSPIRATION FOR ENERGYEFFICIENT 
PROPULSION 
A. Inspiration from the Whirligig Beetle 
Three significant morphological characteristics of the 
whirligig beetle related to its propulsion efficiency are (a) 
propulsor’s joint active actuation, (b) moving hairs, and (c) 
beating pattern regulation [5].  
1) Micro/Nano-scale Morphologies of the Whirligig 
Beetle Propulsor 
Through changing the propulsor’s joint angles, whirligig 
beetles are able to control the propulsion and increase thrust. 
Fig.1(a) shows multiple joints, which are actuated to reach 
the desired positions for greater utilization of fluid force [4]. 
Based on this observation, we proposed a passively 
oscillated propulsor design actuated proximally. With proper 
flexural rigidity along the propulsor, it is feasible to regulate 
the compliant propulsor as the whirligig beetle does, and 
produced more thrust with the given actuation.

swimming; (c) Normalized efficiency for the six beating patterns in (a). 
Efficiency was defined as: travelled distance/number of stroke.

Additionally, the moving hairs attached to the whirligig 
beetle propulsors increases the contact area with the fluid 
and allow a larger thrust [10]. Inspired from this, we 
designed a propulsor with stiff and soft flexural rigidity for 
the power and recovery stroke sides, respectively [11]. 
2) Propulsor’s Beating Patterns  
Whirligig beetles are able to regulate the beating of their 
propulsors in different situations to achieve high swimming 
efficiency [7]. Six beating patterns were selected [5, 7], and 
quantitatively analyzed for an efficient propulsion method 
development. With the results plotted in Fig.1 (c), we found 
the synchronized (Fig.1(b)-Pattern D) and alternating 
(Fig.1(b)-Pattern C) beating of the hind propulsors were 
more efficient than the others. Based on this observation, we 
proposed an optimization method to determine an energy 
efficient beating pattern. 
B. Whirligig Beetle Inspired Swimming Robot 
Inspired by the energy-efficient propulsion system of the 
whirligig beetle, we have developed a robotic platform 
(Fig.2) to realize efficient swimming. Dimensions of the 
robot body were scaled up proportionally about 35 times 
from the whirligig beetle. Propulsors were fabricated with 
flexible material and independently actuated by Hitec 
HS-5086WP waterproof servo motors. The servos can rotate 
at a speed of 60°/0.15s when powered by a TENERGY 
6V/2000mAh battery. The mbed NXP LPC1768 
microcontroller is connected to a laptop by a Bluetooth radio. 
In addition, acceleration, orientation and energy 
consumption are monitored real-time by a MPU-9150 and a 
custom power monitoring circuit. All the components are 
mounted on the custom designed PCB, and the total weight 
of the assembled robot is 817 g.

DESIGN OPTIMIZATION OF EFFICIENT PROPULSION 
Based on the whirligig beetle inspired swimming robot 
in Section?-C, a kinematics model of ellipsoid body with

locomotion. Fig.3 (b) shows the robot body parameters. The

A. Propulsor Flexural Rigidity Optimization 
In order to realize the propulsor flexural rigidity 
optimization, the propulsor was isolated from the body 
(superscript k used to distinguish propulsors can be 
neglected for all variables in Section III-A) and the flexural 
rigidity on the power stroke side was set large enough to 
guarantee thrust production. On the recovery stroke side, the 
flexural rigidity was set as

The optimal beating pattern can be obtained by solving 
the boundary value problem (26) (28) and (29), with the 
boundary conditions (25). This optimization problem can be 
solved using the bvp5c solver provided by MATLAB [14]. 
?. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
In order to validate the proposed optimization methods, 
we tested the swimming robot using the results from 
simulations and experiments. Parameters used in the 
simulations and experiments are listed in Tab.1.

A. Compliant Propulsor Flexural Rigidity Optimization 
Through flexural rigidity optimization, we found that 
stiff ends and soft middle on the recovery stroke side (Fig.5 
(a)) allowed the propulsor to achieve larger thrust. 
Fig.5 Flexural rigidity optimization (a) and propulsor fabrication (b). With 
the selected silicone (Young’s Modulus is 1.31?105 Pa for mint green 
silicone, and 2.78?105 Pa for red silicone), the mould was designed based 
on the optimized propulsor using 3D drawing software (Solidworks 2012). 
The mould was fabricated by STRATASYS FORTUS 250mc 3D printer. 
To validate the optimized flexural rigidity, the swimming 
robot was tested with an arbitrary selected flexural rigidity 
(70% of the optimized value) for the propulsors. The results 
in Fig.6 indicated that the optimized propulsor achieved a 
larger acceleration when compared to the arbitrary propulsor, 
especially during the recovery stroke (i.e., 0.8s~1.50s).

B. Beating Pattern Optimization 
1) Propulsor Beating Sequence 
Using the optimization method proposed in Section III-B, 
the efficient beating pattern (Fig.7 (a)) was identified. Fig.7 
(b) shows that the robot makes a sinusoidal-like oscillation 
when propelled by the optimized beating pattern. The three 
swimming periods in Fig.7 (c) accurately correspond to the 
optimized beating pattern, further illustrating that alternating 
beating of propulsors improves the propulsion efficiency.

swimming periods. 
2) Optimal Beating Pattern For the Robot 
It was difficult to test the robot with the optimized torque 
due to the actuation limitations from the servos. The 
experimental torque was obtained for the robot tested by 
guaranteeing the robot propulsors following the optimized 
beating pattern. The body orientation in Fig.8 (a) and (b) 
showed that the robot only rotated during the power stroke 
(i.e., 0s-0.8s) and kept the same posture during the recovery 
stroke (i.e., 0.8s-1.5s). This helped the robot maintain a 
stable motion for high speed coasting.

simulated and experimental (d) robot trajectory. 
Fig.8 (c) and (d) show that propelled by the optimized 
beating pattern, the robot made a small S-shape path while 
swimming, with a speed of 0.11m/s. Similar locomotion 
habits have been observed for whirligig beetles. 
3) Beating Pattern Comparison 
In order to validate the efficiency of the optimized 
beating pattern, three groups of tests were conducted, 
including 1) simultaneous beating of four propulsors 
(hr+hl+mr+ml), 2) alternating, symmetric beating of the 
hind and middle propulsors (hr+hlmr+ml), and 3) the 
optimized asymmetric, alternating beating pattern 
(hlmr+hrml). Both the travelling distance (Fig.9) and 
efficiency comparisons (Tab.2) indicated that the optimized 
2467
asymmetric, alternating beating was the most efficient.

the three beating patterns. Trajectories were extracted using image 
processing method by recognizing feature points [15]. 
Comparing the optimized pattern to the other cases further 
illustrates how the beating pattern can be adjusted to 
improve the propulsion efficiency. First, as compared to the 
hr+hl+mr+ml pattern, we noticed the alternating propulsor 
beating helps to increase the propulsion ability, and the 
efficiency was lifted from 0.18/0.18 to 0.35/0.20 after 
implementing the optimized pattern. Second, the comparison 
to the hr+hlmr+ml pattern indicated that asymmetric 
beating contributes to the swimming efficiency, as shown by 
the symmetric beating of different side propulsors being 
33%/15% less than the efficiency created by the asymmetric 
beating, where the Common/Bolded, Italic font formats 
represent the simulation/experimental data respectively. 
TABLE 2. PROPULSION EFFICIENCY COMPARISONS 
 
Furthermore, it can be seen that only the optimized 
beating pattern causes the sinusoidal-like oscillation, and 
S-shaped trajectory. This confirmed the observation from 
our previous study that the S-shaped swimming is more 
energy efficient for the whirligig beetle [5]. 
?. CONCLUSION 
In this paper, we have developed a bio-inspired energy 
efficient propulsion mechanism, and validated the design 
using a whirligig beetle inspired swimming robot. Using the 
optimized flexural rigidity and beating pattern, the whirligig 
beetle inspired swimming robot has demonstrated all key 
features observed in whirligig beetles, such as extending the 
surface area during the power stroke, alternating asymmetric 
beating, and oscillation of the body orientation to generate 
the S-shaped trajectory.
