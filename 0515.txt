Abstract— To ensure safe and reliable operation in a robotic
oil drilling system, it is essential to detect contact events such as
impacts and slips between end-effectors and workpieces. In this
challenging application, where high forces are used to manipu-
late heavy metal pipes in noisy environments, acoustic emissions
(AE) sensors offer a promising contact sensing solution. Real-
time AE signal features are used to create a multinomial contact
event classiﬁer. The sensitivity of signal features to a variety of
contact events including two types of slip is presented. Results
indicate that the classiﬁer is able to robustly and dynamically
classify contact events with >90% accuracy using a small set
of AE signal features.

I. INTRODUCTION
Robotic drilling has become an increasingly desirable goal
as the oil industry seeks to enhance operator safety and
reduce costs. Robotic Drilling Systems AS (RDS) has devel-
oped an autonomous rig for unmanned exploration drilling
in harsh environments. Contact and slip event detection is
an important capability for reliable robotic manipulation, en-
abling quick and appropriate reaction to unanticipated events.
This paper addresses unintentional slips between robotic end
effectors (grippers and roughnecks) and their payloads: large,
heavy metal pipes (Fig. 1). This is a challenging new robotics
application for which no prior solutions exist.
Numerous robotic slip detection methods exist, many of
which rely on detecting minute displacements between an
end effector and payload using mechanical, optical, magnetic
or even thermal transducers. Bio-inspired methods often
measure the vibrations or rapid changes in contact stress
that accompany incipient slips. These dynamic sensing ap-
proaches have the advantage of allowing response before
noticeable movement occurs [1,2]. Recent reviews of contact
and slip sensing are found in [3]–[5].
For robotic drilling applications, sensor placement at the
contact interface is impossible due to hazardous conditions
including high temperatures and pressures as well as ex-
plosion risks. The presented scheme demonstrates the abil-
ity to identify contact events using non-colocated acoustic
emissions (AE) sensing. Early investigations [6,7] indicated
that AE is sensitive to slip between metal grippers and
workpieces, inspiring the approach presented here. Unlike
conventional robotic tactile sensors, AE transducers can be
easily packaged to withstand harsh environments. In addition,
AE signals typically occur at frequencies over 100 kHz, well
above common low-frequency noise sources.
This paper describes the application of AE signal analysis
to detect and distinguish various contact events such as
slips and impacts. The next section reviews AE sensing,
focusing on signal features likely to be effective for such a
classiﬁcation problem. The subsequent section describes the
signal processing method and event classiﬁcation scheme.
Experiments, initially using a benchtop apparatus and ulti-
mately the full-scale RDS robotic gripper, are described and
results presented, followed by conclusions and further work.

II. ACOUSTIC EMISSIONS SENSING
A. AE Generation and Detection
The interaction of steel components generates stress waves
called accoustic emissions (AE). Asperity contact is the pri-
mary source [8] with contributions from plastic deformation,
fracture, impulsive shock, and micro-vibration [9,10]. AE
signal analysis is an established tool for monitoring metal-
working processes and the structural health of metal assem-
blies [9,10]. Advantages of AE include a direct correlation
with the amount of metal deformation or fracture and a high
signal to noise ratio [9,11,12].

As AE waves travel through a structure, material hetero-
geneities and component interfaces attenuate the signal [9,
11,13]. Thus, AE is typically measured using collocated
piezoelectric transducers mounted near the source of plastic
deformation [7,14]. A vibration couplant grease is often
applied between the AE sensor and its mount to improve
transmission. Measured AE signals consist of “hits”, or
bursts of activity for which the signal magnitude is above
some threshold.
In the present application, contact events among grippers,
pipes, and external objects all generate AE. A single event
can generate many AE hits, each of which has signal features
that may be extracted for pattern classiﬁcation. Contact
conditions signiﬁcantly affect AE signals [7,11,14,15], a
feature exploited here to distinguish between contact events.
B. Event Classiﬁcation Techniques
Various supervised and unsupervised pattern recognition
techniques have been applied to AE signals for manufac-
turing and structural monitoring applications [16,17]. Super-
vised learning methods range from simple classiﬁers such
as k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) [18] to more sophisiticated
back-propagation neural networks [19] and support vector
machines (SVM) [20,21]. If prior knowledge regarding event
classes is unavailable, unsupervised classiﬁers can be used
to perform event classiﬁcation. Some methods proposed for
AE data analysis include max-min distance, cluster seeking,
k-means, and isodata [22,23]. In both supervised and unsu-
pervised cases, prior work has demonstrated the ability to
distinguish between different types of AE events [24]. To
the authors’ knowledge, such real-time AE features have not
previously been used for classifying robotic contact events.

Fig. 2: Contact events classes for the robotic gripper and
roughneck. Labels 1 and 2 represent sensor placement loca-
tions on the robotic gripper setup detailed in Section IV-B
The system manipulates pipes with a robotic gripper
and a roughneck (Fig. 1). Both the gripper and roughneck
grasp steel pipes with hardened steel dies. Contact events
(including impacts, slips, and other unspeciﬁed sources of
noise) may occur at either site.
The robotic gripper’s primary function is to transfer pipes
and move them into or out of the roughneck. During pipe
transfer and placement, slips may occur along the pipe’s
axis. However, rotational slips about the pipe’s long axis are
unlikely. Contact event classes for the gripper are: (I) linear
slip, (V) impact, and (VI) noise (Fig. 2).
The roughneck has two sets of jaws that grip pipes in
a manner similar to a lathe chuck. Its primary function is
to connect sections of pipe by screwing or threading them
together. Pipe threading has two stages: spin-in and make-
up. During spin-in, the rotating upper jaw grips the upper
pipe and spins at 100 RPM, applying torques ranging from 2-
3 kNm, while the lower jaws hold the bottom pipe stationary.
If spin-in is successful, the pipe mating process culminates
with a make-up operation, slowly rotating the upper pipe a
bit further with a torque of 20-60 kNm. Slips are possible at
the upper and lower jaw contacts. In addition, intentional
slips occur between the threads of the upper and lower
pipes during spin-in and make-up. Both the intentional and
unintentional slips involve plastic deformation and generate
AE signals. However, it is important to differentiate them be-
cause unintentional slips represent a process failure. External
impact events are also possible during this process, therefore
the contact events for the roughneck are: (II) rotational slip,
(III) spin-in threading, (IV) make-up threading, (V) impact,
and (VI) noise.
B. Sensor Features Implementation
1) Data Acquisition and Postprocessing: Two wideband
integral preampliﬁer sensors (MISTRAS, Model WDI-AST)
with gains of 40dB and response frequencies 200-900 kHz
were used to capture AE signals at a hit length of 1.28 ms.
A PCI-2 Based AE System (MISTRAS) was used to sample
the signals. In practice, the sensors also captured signals in
the 50-100 kHz range.

Data from both sensors were used for the event classiﬁer.
Feature selection is key to successful pattern recognition
methodology. As noted in Section II, prior work has shown
correlations between AE features and various contact phe-
nomena. Based on these ﬁndings, 7 of the 19 software-
generated features were selected for event classiﬁcation (see
Table I). Performance results are presented in Section V.
C. Contact Event Classiﬁer
The contact event sets for the classiﬁer are modeled as
multinomial distributions [29] with nominal labels assigned
to each event class. Model ﬁtting on AE features was per-
formed using WEKA 3.7 [30], and the response model was
calculated in MATLAB. Although prior art has demonstrated
good multi-class event classiﬁcation results using Gaussian
discriminant analysis (GDA) [16]. GDA was developed for
normally distributed explanatory variables and is appropriate
when normality assumptions are fulﬁlled. However, here the
predictor data distribution is unknown, making a multinomial
logistic regression the more robust choice because the latter
makes fewer assumptions regarding underlying data [31].
The multinomial logistic regression model is given below.

Each AE hit is classiﬁed as the event with the highest
probability value. The algorithm was trained and tested using
70/30 holdout on both the benchtop and RDS robotic gripper
devices. Parameters for the robotic gripper and the roughneck
event sets were trained separately.
IV. EXPERIMENTS
A. Benchtop Setup (Stanford, CA)
1) Apparatus: The benchtop setup (Fig. 4) has a 25.4 mm
steel pipe gripped by a bench yoke vise (RIDGID) mounted
to an aluminum frame. The vise jaws have three hardened-
steel dies with standard oil-drilling proﬁles. A 7 kN thrust,
linear actuator (ServoCity) was mounted to the frame. On
RDS’s robotic gripper, the AE sensors cannot be mounted
directly to the pipes, dies, or gripper jaws. In order to
mimic this constraint, in the benchtop setup the AE sensors
were mounted on steel plates mounted between the bottom
dies and the vise body, with couplant grease applied at all
interfaces between sensors, plates, and dies. A force load cell
was mounted between the top die and the vise yoke, and a
witness LVDT sensor was aligned with the actuator.

2) Procedure: 32 experiments were used to generate AE
data: 6 trials of (I) linear slip, 3 of (II) rotational slip, 3
of (III) spin-in, 2 of (IV) make-up, 12 of (V) impact, and
6 of (VI) noise. The linear actuator produced linear slip by
pushing the pipe through the clamped vise jaws. All other
contact events were performed manually. Impacts involved
striking the pipe, vise, or frame with a dead blow mallet
or a metal hammer. Low-frequency noise was introduced by
attaching vibration motors to various parts of the system.
Note that although the linear actuator produces a controlled
linear motion, the slip phenomenon we are attempting to
detect are uncontrollable by deﬁnition. So long as there is

steel-on-steel interaction, AE signals can be recorded and
further characterized based on signal features and not the
means by which the signals are produced. The LVDT tracked
linear pipe displacement, and the load cell collected grip
force levels. Note that on this setup, the grip force is not
actively maintained throughout each trial, it is set only by the
initial tightening of the vise. Grip forces during slip ranged
from 600 N to 1.5 kN. Data were sampled at 1 MHz and
processed with AE threshold set at 30 dB. AE magnitudes
are similar to those obtained on gripper as noted in the next
section.
B. Robotic Gripper (Sandnes, Norway)
1) Apparatus: RDS’s apparatus has a hydraulic linear ac-
tuator and a robotic gripper capable of 25.8 kN of grip force
with three sets of steel dies. Experiments were performed
using a 253 mm pipe. The same AE sensors were attached to
various locations on the gripper, with couplant grease at the
interface (Fig. 6). Grip force was held constant throughout
each trial via closed-loop control.

2) Procedure: The same gripper contact events (I) lin-
ear slip, (V) impact, and (VI) noise (Fig. 2) were tested.
Linear slip and impact trial protocols were unchanged with
respect to the benchtop apparatus. Noise was introduced via
hydraulic servo valves mounted on the system’s frame. Two
locations were tested (Fig. 6): location 1 is analogous to
the benchtop setup in terms of AE coupling, location 2 is
RDS’s desired sensor placement location, as location 1 is
within a hazardous “red zone”. At each location, three trials
were conducted for impact, noise, and linear slip at two force
levels (2.7 kN and 8.1 kN). These trials were used to train and
test the classiﬁer.
Additional multi-event sequence trials at the two grip force
levels were also conducted. These tests involved a sequence
of continuous contact events. For these experiments, AE
threshold was raised to 35 dB due to baseline noise levels.
V. RESULTS
A. Benchtop Results
1) Sensor Feature Visualization: Visualization of three
features (frequency centroid, normalized AMP, normalized
ASL) demonstrates qualitatively the separation of event
classes into distinct populations (Fig. 5). While gripper
events have excellent separation among event classes, rough-
neck events show good distinction for (II) rotational slip, (V)
impact, and (VI) noise while (III) spin-in and (IV) make-up
overlap. Plotting three other features visually distinguishes
(III) and (IV) (Fig. 5c).
2) Event Classiﬁer Performance: For hold-out validation,
the algorithm is accurate and robust (Tables II and III) for
accuracy (acc), speciﬁcity (spec), and sensitivity (sens). For
robotic drilling applications, sensitivity is crucial because it
reﬂects false negative rates (FNR). A false negative indicates
slip occurred but was not accurately identiﬁed as such. High
sensitivity is indicative of low FNR. The robotic gripper
classiﬁer demonstrated accuracy above 97%, and FNR was
highest for impact. The roughneck classiﬁer demonstrated
accuracy above 90%, and FNR was again highest for impact.
Note that each event class contains AE data from multiple
experimental trials.

B. RDS Robotic Gripper Results
1) Sensor Feature Visualization: Visualizing the same
three features for the RDS robotic gripper also shows ex-
cellent event separation at locations 1 and 2. Normalized
amplitude levels for (I) linear slip are lower at location 2 than
location 1, while the overall distributions at both locations
are similar to the distribution for the same event class on the
benchtop setup.
2) Event Classiﬁer Performance: For hold-out validation,
the algorithm is still accurate and robust (Tables IV and V).
Location 2 is particularly important because it is the ideal
sensor location in practice, although location 1 is more
analogous to the benchtop setup and closest to the slip
source. At location 1, the classiﬁer demonstrated accuracy
above 97%, and FNR was again highest for impact. The
location 2 classiﬁer also demonstrated accuracy above 97%,
but FNR was highest for linear slip. This difference may be
attributed to signal attenuation due to remote sensor location.

3) Performance on Multi-event Sequences: Fig. 8 demon-
strates classiﬁer performance over a ﬁnite time period during
which various contact events were performed. The algorithm
successfully detected all events and performed a classiﬁca-
tion. Each event had numerous associated hits, and the vast
majority of each event’s hits were correctly classiﬁed. During
the test sequence shown in Fig. 8a, the system was impacted
at 0 s, and two long slip events occurred at 16 and 26 s.
For this sequence, classiﬁer accuracy was 93.1%. The test
sequence in Fig. 8b consists of three short slip events at
5, 12, and 15 s followed by impacts at 18 and 27 s. For
this sequence, classiﬁer accuracy was 95.8%. Performance
is visualized in Fig. 8.
C. Witness Sensor Slip Validation
To validate linear slip conditions on the benchtop setup, a
LVDT sensor served as a witness sensor for linear displace-
ment. As expected, plastic deformation of steel increases
with slip and generates increasing numbers of AE hits. On
average, eight AE hits were detected and classiﬁed within
1 mm of displacement. For robotic oil drilling, slips of less
than 2 mm are not signiﬁcant.
VI. DISCUSSION
A. Contact Event Classiﬁer
The choice of reference class k in the multinomial re-
gression is important for performance as the probability
constraint on the multinomial regression classiﬁer calculates
weights only for the ﬁrst k   1 events. Here, classiﬁer
performance was best when (VI) noise was the reference
event. Normalization of certain AE sensor features such
as amplitude and ASL was found to improve classiﬁcation
accuracy over non-normalized features, primarily due to
numerical precision when calculating feature weights 
j
.
In addition to high accuracy and robustness, the classiﬁer
demonstrates the potential for realtime implementation (with
ofﬂine model parameter ﬁtting). Using the MATLAB proﬁler
(5000 executions, 1ms clock precision, 2 GHz clock speed)
on standard Windows 7 OS without any code optimization,
our classiﬁer executes in 1ms per AE hit on average.
B. Validated AE Conditions
Results demonstrate the utility of AE signal analysis as
a contact event detection tool for robotic manipulation. The
classiﬁer demonstrates high performance for both a benchtop
setup and RDS’s robotic gripper for oil drilling. Differences
between the two setups include physical scale, noise sources
(and consequent AE threshold), associated system artifacts,
magnitude of grip forces, and the number of mechanical
interfaces between the slip location and the sensor.
Prior art in AE sensing primarily uses direct coupling,
which is impossible to achieve for this application. On both
setups, results indicate the ability to detect contact events
using non-collocated AE sensors mounted a few mechanical
connections away from the source of AE signals. The bench-
top setup had couplant grease at all interfaces for vibrational
coupling while the robotic gripper setup only had couplant
grease at the sensor mounting location. Enhanced vibrational
coupling in the robotic gripper could increase performance.
Knowledge of known noise sources at sensor resonance
aids classiﬁer performance. RDS requires sensor placement
at location 2 (Fig. 6). Initially, servo valves were attached
to the frame and introduced high magnitude noise (80 dB)
at the AE sensor resonance (125 kHz). Because this noise
source was located much closer to location 2 than location
1, the noise overwhelmed slip signals at location 2 and led
to poor classiﬁer performance. Classiﬁer performance was
excellent when the valves were relocated. To mitigate such
effects in practice, ﬁltering via software or using narrow-
band AE sensors could also sufﬁce.
VII. CONCLUSIONS
An accurate and robust method has been presented for
detecting contact events between grippers and workpieces
for robotic oil drilling. The method uses acoustic emissions
(AE) and, for each burst or “hit” of AE signal, uses features
of the AE signal to determine probabilities for each of a set
of possible contact events. This is a new approach to contact
event sensing and classiﬁcation in an environment that most
other robotic tactile sensors cannot survive.
Traditional AE sensing applications mount a sensor on
or immediately adjacent to a workpiece. However, in oil
drilling it is infeasible to attach sensors directly to the pipes
or even to the jaws of the grippers that handle them. Results

presented here indicate that coupling the AE sensors close
to the location of interest, but not directly at the source of
contact, nonetheless allows accurate identiﬁcation of multiple
contact events.
VIII. FUTURE WORK
This work is part of a broader goal to develop a state
monitoring system for robotic oil drilling. The goal of such
a system is to determine whether the suite of sensor infor-
mation at each instant is consistent with normal programmed
operation.
Use of multiple sensors may aid event identiﬁcation
through source location. For example, signal coherence
among neighboring sensors may allow the discrimination of
incipient slip occurring at different contact interfaces [32].
Identiﬁcation of additional contact events is also possible if
their AE signal features are distinct, a condition satisﬁed if
the contact conditions are also distinct.
Utilizing contextual information may improve the clas-
siﬁer robustness [33]. Contextual information captures a
priori system knowledge and may logically exclude events or
raise/lower the conﬁdence that a particular event is occurring.
Examples of contextual information that may exclude certain
events include pipe presence and sensor location; if a pipe is
absent, slip events (I-IV) cannot occur. Contextual features
with more complex distributions may incorporate visual
or audible sensor information, human feedback, or grip
force information. Implementation would involve assigning a
conﬁdence distribution function to these context features and
evaluating them for each contact event. Each contact event
probability the multinomial regression produces would then
be multiplied by these values.
Using time history may also prove beneﬁcial. A single
contact event typically generates multiple AE hits. In this
work, each hit is classiﬁed individually because the number
of hits per event has not been investigated. However, if a
particular event type has been assigned to a series of hits,
the probability of the same event increases for subsequent
hits within a short time period.
