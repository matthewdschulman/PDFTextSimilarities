poses in a coordinated manner and the coordination is referred 
to as a postural synergy. Using postural synergies, dexterous 
grasping tasks could be accomplished on a prosthetic hand via 
only a few (usually two) control inputs. Instead of implementing 
postural synergies digitally, this paper presents the design of a 
simple continuum mechanism for implementing the postural 
synergies mechanically. The design, fabrication and assembly of 
a prosthetic hand are firstly presented, followed by the synthesis 
of postural synergies from various grasping poses. Referring to 
the extracted postural synergies, structural parameters of the 
continuum mechanism are calculated based on a kinematics 
model. Experimental verifications are also presented to 
demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed idea. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
UILDING an anthropomorphic versatile prosthetic hand 
is a challenging task. The design should be dexterous 
enough for various daily tasks and controllable through a 
bio-signal interface, such as EMG (electro-myography) or 
EEG (electro-encephalography). However the bandwidth of 
these interfaces is too limited to allow individual control of 
each joint on a fully actuated robotic hand. 
Findings in neurology showed that CNS (Central Nervous 
System) controls hand muscles in a coordinated manner. This 
coordination is referred to as a postural synergy [1]. Each 
postural synergy represents the flexion or extension statuses 
of a group of muscles. CNS combines the postural synergies 
to realize various hand motions by adjusting each synergy’s 
weight. Combination of the two primary postural synergies 
accounts for 84% of the variance of dozens of different 
grasping poses [2]. Furthermore, CNS switches between 
different sets of postural synergies for distinct grasping tasks 
[3].  
These findings enabled the control of a fully-actuated 
robotic hands via a few (usually two to three) inputs, 
potentially allowing the state-of-the-art ones [4-7] to be

applied as prostheses. These inputs could be decoded from an 
amputee’s bio-signal interface and act as coefficients while 
combining the postural synergies. For example, two synergies 
are used to control 12 motors of the DLR II Hand for various 
grasping tasks [8], whereas two synergies are used to drive 20 
actuators of the UB Hand IV [9]. Three synergies are used to 
control 13 motors of the SAH hand [10], whereas two and 
three postural synergies are used to control 24 motors of the 
ACT hand for writing and piano playing [11, 12].  
The concept of postural synergies provides an alternative 
understanding of hand motion atlas to the discrete grasp 
taxonomy as in [13-15].  What’s more, grasping planning 
could also be facilitated as shown in a milestone work by 
Ciocarlie and Allen [16].  
A popular approach adopted by many designs [8-12] is to 
design a fully-actuated robotic hand and implement postural 
synergies digitally in the controller. This approach is 
convenient for implementing and switching between several 
groups of synergies. But the hand would be complex and 
expensive with multiple sets of miniature servomotors with 
amplifiers, feedback sensors and the controller. If postural 
synergies could be mechanically implemented, such a 
prosthetic hand could potentially be more affordable. 
Mechanical implementation of the postural synergies was 
attempted by Brown and Asada using differential pulleys [17] 
and by Xu et al. [18, 19] using planetary gears. Both options 
are feasible in terms of realizing the synergies. But neither 
option can be easily further miniaturized for practical uses. 
This paper proposes to use a simple continuum structure for 
the mechanical implementation of the postural synergies. The 
proof-of-concept prototype is shown in Fig. 1. The sparse 
arrangement of the structural members in the continuum 
mechanism leaves us a possibility for further miniaturization.

The main contribution of this paper is the proposal of using 
continuum mechanisms for mechanical implementation of the 
postural synergies. The minor contribution is a specific 
design of such a continuum mechanism which realizes the 
combination of two postural synergies. The future goal is to 
design a continuum mechanism, which can be completely 
imbedded in a palm, for the synergy implementations. 
The paper is organized as follows. Section II presents the 
design of a prosthetic hand and the synthesis of the postural 
synergies. Section III presents the kinematics of the simple 
continuum mechanism and the dimension synthesis for the 
synergy implementation. Section IV presents experimental 
validations with the conclusions and the future work followed 
in Section V. 
II. HAND DESIGN AND SYNERGY SYNTHESIS 
Postural synergy synthesis involves the extraction of the 
principle components of various grasping poses. Instead of 
inviting 5 to 10 human subjects, asking them to perform the 
desired grasping tasks, recording and analyzing the human 
hand motions using fancy systems such as CyberGlove
TM
 or 
Vicon
TM
 cameras, this paper proposes to extract postural 
synergies directly from the grasping poses of a fabricated 
prosthetic hand. This idea was also practiced in [8]. 
The design, fabrication and assembly of an underactuated 
prosthetic hand are presented in Section II.A, whereas Section 
II.B presents the synergy synthesis. 
A. Descriptions of the prosthetic hand 
As shown in Fig. 2, the underactuated prosthetic hand has 
16 joints, including 4 joints for the thumb and 3 joints for each 
finger. As indicated in Fig.2(a), Letters T and I before the 
underscore indicate the joints for the thumb and the index 
finger. Abbreviations of rot, mcp, ip, abd, pip and dip indicate 
the rotation joint, the metacarpophalangeal joint, the 
interphalangeal joint, the abduction joint, the proximal and 
the distal interphalangeal joint respectively.  
 
Fig. 2. Design of the underactuated prosthetic hand: (a) the assembly and 
(b) the hand with six screw micrometers as push-pull actuators 
The 16 joints are actuated by 6 NiTi (nickel-titanium alloy) 
super-elastic thin rods. Diameter of the NiTi rod is 0.7mm.  
Each finger is actuated by one NiTi rod. As shown in Fig. 3, 
the NiTi rod is attached to the distal phalange of the index 
finger. Then the NiTi rod is routed through the channels in the 
intermediate phalange and the proximal phalange towards the 
palm. The rod is passed through a PTFE guiding cannulae 
(outer diameter 3.0mm and inner diameter 1.0mm) all the 
way to a screw micrometer as shown in Fig. 2(b).  
By manually rotating the screw micrometer, the NiTi rod 
would be pulled or pushed to close or open the index finger. 
Torsional springs are included for the I_pip, the I_mcp and 
the I_dip joints to allow approximately equal rotation angles 
of the three coupled joints when the NiTi rod is pulled.  
The middle, the ring and the little fingers have structures 
and actuation schemes similar to those of the index finger.  
The thumb is actuated by two NiTi rods. One NiTi rod 
actuates the T_rot joint while the other actuates the T_abd, the 
T_mcp and the T_ip joints. The NiTi rods are again routed 
through PTFE guiding cannulae to the screw micrometers for 
the actuation of the thumb.

B. Postural synergy synthesis 
Postural synergies are usually extracted as the first a few 
(usually two) principal components from the recorded joint 
angles of a hand under various grasping poses.  
Instead of recording individual joint angles, this paper 
proposes to directly record the push-pull actuation lengths for 
synergy synthesis. The synergy values with a unit of length 
could be directly used for dimension determination of the 
continuum mechanism as described in Section III.B 
The six screw micrometers are manually driven to push or 
pull the NiTi rods to let the hand form various grasping poses. 
The measured actuation lengths for the ten poses are listed in 
Table I. The values in the T_rot column means the actuation 
lengths for the T_rot joint, whereas the values in the Thumb 
column means the actuation lengths for the coupled T_abd, 
T_mcp and T_ip joints. The rest columns list actuation lengths 
for the index, the middle, the ring and the little fingers. A zero 
mm of these actuation lengths corresponds to the fully 
extended pose of the hand. Some poses are shown in Fig. 4.  
Each pose can be written as a pose vector 
61 i ?
?? p 
( ,, , i12 10 = ? ), whose elements are corresponding actuation 
lengths. The ten poses can be put side to side to form a pose 
matrix P . Singular value decomposition can be performed on 
this pose matrix:

III. SYNERGY IMPLEMENTATION USING A  
CONTINUUM MECHANISM 
This paper proposes to implement the postural synergy 
mechanically. In other words, a mechanical system shall be 
designed to realize linear combination of the two postural 
synergies under different weights (or called synergy inputs). 
Mechanical implementation of the postural synergies was 
previously attempted by Brown and Asada using differential 
pulleys [17] and by Xu et al. [18, 19] using planetary gears. 
This paper proposes to use a simple continuum mechanism 
to implement the postural synergies. Structure of the 
continuum mechanism is shown in Fig. 5. It consists of an end 
disk, several secondary backbones, a few spacer disks and a 
base disk. All the backbones are made from thin NiTi 
super-elastic rods. The secondary backbones are only 
attached to the end disk and can slide in holes of the spacer 
disks and the base disk. A virtual primary backbone is 
assumed to be at the center and it characterizes length and 
shape of the continuum mechanism. 
Among the secondary backbones in Fig. 5, four driving 
backbones are arranged at the outermost positions in the 
mechanism and several driven backbones are arranged at 
various inside positions. Push-pull actuations of the driving 
backbones will actively bend the continuum mechanism. 
Bending of the mechanism will lead to translational outputs 
from the driven backbones. 
Kinematics of this mechanism will be derived in Section 
III.A and dimension determination according to the specific 
postural synergy values are presented in Section III.B.

IV. EXPERIMENTAL VERIFICATIONS 
A series of experiments were carried out to demonstrate the 
effectiveness of the mechanical synergy implementation. The 
experimental setup is shown in Fig. 7.  
The prosthetic hand has six NiTi rods for push-pull 
actuation. These actuation rods are routed through guiding 
cannulae made from PTFE to the continuum mechanism. The 
six actuation rods are connected to the driven backbones of 
the continuum mechanism via six locking blocks. These NiTi 
rod locking blocks also allow the adjustments of the lengths 
of the NiTi rods. Adjusting the lengths of the NiTi rods is 
equivalent to adjust the average pose of the prosthetic hand. 
The four driving backbones of the continuum mechanism 
will be pushed and pulled according to the actuation 
kinematics as in Eq. (8). According to the 
i
? ( ,, i1,234 = ) 
values listed in Table III, there is a π difference between 
1
? 
and 
3
? , as well as between 
2
? and 
4
? . Hence the actuation 
length 
1
q is opposite to 
3
q , while 
2
q is opposite to 
4
q . Two 
pinions (each meshed with two racks) are driven by two 
stepper motors to push and pull the driving backbones 
according to the actuation kinematics in Eq. (8). Driving 
backbones are routed from the racks to the continuum 
mechanism through rigid stainless steel channels, preventing 
buckling of the driving backbones. 
The two stepper motors firstly stopped at the original 
positions (
1
0 g = and 
2
0 g = ). At the original positions, the 
hand is in its average pose.  
The motor 
1
g was firstly commanded to move between 
-24.7 mm and +21.2 mm with the motor 
2
g at zero position. 
The corresponding hand poses are shown in Fig. 8 and in the 
multimedia extension. Then the motor 
2
g was commanded 
to move between -9.4 mm and +12.5 mm with the motor 
1
g 
at zero position. The corresponding hand poses are also 
shown in Fig. 8 and in the multimedia extension.

The

g values from Table I were then used to 
drive the two stepper motors to realize the push-pull 
actuations of the driving backbones. The grasping poses were 
successfully regenerated, grasping the same objects as shown 
in Fig. 9 and in the multimedia extension.

Instead of using multiple servomotors and implementing 
the postural synergies digitally in a controller, this paper 
proposes to implement the synergies mechanically using a 
simple continuum mechanism in order to eventually make 
such a synergy-based prosthetic hand more affordable. 
Details about the hand design, the synergy synthesis and 
the continuum mechanism design are presented. Using the 
continuum mechanism, two independent translational inputs 
are scaled and combined to generate six translational outputs 
to drive the prosthetic hand. A series of experiments validated 
the proposed idea.  
Future work would mainly be directed to explore other 
mechanism topologies to miniaturize the current continuum 
mechanism, in order to eventually embed two motors and the 
mechanical synergy implementation completely in hand.
