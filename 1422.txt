Robust Pose Graph Optimization Using Stochastic Gradient Descent
John Wang and Edwin Olson
AbstractÑ Robust SLAM methods can allow robots to re-
cover correct maps even in the presence of incorrect loop
closures. While these approaches improve robustness to outliers,
they are susceptible to getting caught in local minima, a problem
which is exacerbated by poor initial estimates.
In this paper, we describe a stochastic gradient descent
optimization approach that exhibits greater robustness to poor
initial estimates. Our approach can either be used as a stand-
alone optimization system or in conjunction with existing
methods such as Gauss-Newton solvers. Using a combination
of synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that our
proposed approach is able to recover correct pose graphs
signiÞcantly more frequently than other methods when large
initialization errors are present.
I. INTRODUCTION
Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) systems
must overcome two major problems with real-world data.
First is the problem of noise, particularly noise in odometry
sensors. While noise may be overcome by fusing redundant
observations, extreme noise can lead to poor initial estimates
from which it is impossible to recover the robotÕs true trajec-
tory. Second is the problem of incorrect data associations, or
loop closures. A robot may use visual similarities or laser-
scan matching to determine whether it has visited a place
before. Perceptual aliasing, which occurs when two distinct
places appear the same, can lead to incorrect loop closures.
To date, much work in SLAM has centered around
solving the Þrst problem of correcting for positional error,
sidestepping the second difÞculty by assuming perfect data
association. Many such SLAM algorithms are incapable of
dealing with erroneous loop closures, and even a single
false loop closure can introduce unrecoverable errors into
the robotÕs inferred trajectory. Conventionally, the data as-
sociation problem has been addressed by building Òfront-
endsÓ to Þlter out poor associations. Although this approach
greatly improves the quality of SLAM-generated maps, these
methods alone are inadequate. In a long-running system,
even an extremely low error rate can result in loop closure
errors, which will accumulate over time to cause errors in
the inferred trajectory and the resulting map.
Recent work in SLAM has explicitly modeled the possibil-
ity of incorrect data associations inside the Òback-endÓ solver
[1]Ð[3]. Some of these robust back-ends use extensions to
the pose graph model, such as switchable constraints or
max-mixture constraints. These robust constraints introduce

many local minima into the optimization problem. This can
be illustrated intuitively: suppose a loop closure constraint
is modeled as a Gaussian mixture with a Ònull hypothesisÓ
component (a very high covariance Gaussian) that represents
discarding that loop closure. A solution which discards a
correct loop closure may actually decrease the 
2
error
(eq. 3), since the Ònull hypothesisÓ may contribute very
little 
2
error to the graph. A local minimum occurs if
the graph is in a state where activating any correct loop
closure would increase the 
2
error. These local minima in
the 
2
error function make the max-mixtures optimization
problem difÞcult. Optimization problems with local minima
are more sensitive to the initial values of the variables,
making them less robust to odometry noise. This creates
a trade-off between robustness to loop closure errors and
robustness to initialization error.
Building upon this body of previous work, we present
a robust SLAM optimization algorithm that is resilient to
both poor initial estimates and incorrect data associations.
Our formulation uses a combination of the Gaussian max-
mixtures model and the stochastic gradient descent solver,
which is capable of quickly escaping local minima and often
Þnding the global minimum. The main contributions of this

II. PRIOR WORK
In non-robust pose graph SLAM, Gauss-Newton methods
that rely on factorizing the information matrix are often
used to solve the resulting non-linear optimization problem.
Such methods are sensitive to initial conditions, and a poor
initialization can prevent the algorithm from converging
upon the true solution. A stochastic gradient descent method
has been shown to increase convergence from poor initial
estimates in non-mixture pose graphs [4].
Previous methods to increase robustness involved front-
end validation of loop closures. Such methods include AtlasÕs
nearest-neighbor feature matching [5], Joint Compatibility
Branch and Bound (JCBB) [6], and graph consistency ap-
proaches such as CCDA [7], SCGP [8], and spectral cluster-
ing [9].
Robust SLAM formulations are also not new. Latif, Ca-
dena, and Neira developed the Realizing, Reversing, Recov-
ering (RRR) algorithm [1] to check the consistency between
clusters of edges in a graph. This algorithm is based on the
observation that correct loop closures are mutually consis-
tent, while incorrect loop closures are often outliers. It bears
the most resemblance to conventional front-end veriÞcation
systems, and could be considered an online extension of the
joint compatibility test, where loop closure hypotheses can
be reexamined for consistency in the future.
Sunderhauf and Protzel introduce the concept of switch-
able constraints [3]. By adding a switch variable for each
loop closure, which takes on a real value between 0 and
1, each edge can be turned on, off, or partially on by
having the switch variable take on a value between 0 and
1. These variables essentially modify the shape of the pose
graph, allowing the optimization to turn off false loop closure
constraints.
Relative constraints have been used in existing SLAM
techniques. Olson et al. showed its usefulness for pose graph
optimization [4], which was later extended by Grisetti et al.
to use a spanning tree parameterization [10]. Relative bundle
adjustment techniques have been shown to efÞciently solve
the general SLAM problem, which includes both poses and
landmarks [11], [12].
Olson and Agarwal described the Gaussian max-mixtures
SLAM model [2], on which this work is based. This formula-
tion makes the edge constraints themselves more expressive,
allowing multimodal distributions to be used as edge con-
straints. In particular, loop closure edges can use a robust
cost function which incorporates a high-covariance Ònull
hypothesisÓ component. This work introduces the Cholesky-
MM algorithm, which uses a Gauss-Newton solver to solve
max-mixtures SLAM problems.
III. BACKGROUND
This work focuses on a special case of SLAM that only
considers pose-to-pose constraints. Such a problem arises
naturally from pose matching methods, but can also be
obtained by marginalizing out landmarks. Landmarks can
alternatively be included directly in the state vector, but our
experiments only consist of pose-to-pose links.
Initial state estimates have a signiÞcant effect on the
quality of the Þnal solution. Two common approaches are
using only the odometry information and computing a min-
imum spanning tree (MST) using all available edges. In our
approach, we use odometry as the initial pose estimate. The
goal is to optimize over the state vector x, representing a
series of robot poses, given our observations z. Making the
usual assumption that individual observations are condition-
ally independent, we can factor this probability distribution.

A. Max-Mixtures Model
The max-mixtures model represents each edge distribution
P (z
i
jx) as a mixture of Gaussians based on a max operator.
A mixture model allows us to represent more complex distri-
butions. In our application, we represent the uncertainty of a
loop closure as a Gaussian component (the Ònull hypothesisÓ)
with a very large covariance.

to be Òpushed insideÓ the max (eq. 2). Minimizing this
quantity results in a maximum likelihood estimator that
selects the most probable Gaussian component for each edge

B. Stochastic Gradient Descent
The stochastic gradient descent (SGD) solver optimizes
over a single edge constrainti at a time. This allows it to both
explore and escape from poor local minima, since different
edges will pull the graph in different directions. The cost

C. Incremental State Space
The stochastic gradient descent method lends itself to an
alternative state space representation. Many SLAM imple-
mentations use a global state space, storing an (x;y;) pose
for each node. This representation preserves sparsity in the
information matrix, which is important for computational
efÞciency, since each edge directly affects only two pose
nodes. This overlooks an important property of this problem:
a robotÕs trajectory is cumulative. Intuitively, this means that
if a single pose needs some amount of correction, then it is
likely that the following poses also need similar correction.
In this method, we use the incremental state space as
described in [13]. Instead of using a global state vector
x = (x

Note that the Jacobian for k  a has non-zero values.
SpeciÞcally, any rotation of node a will cause an error with
respect to the rigid-body transformation T . However, these
terms can have very large magnitudes and can cause the
optimization to diverge. Thus, following our earlier work,
we set these terms to zero. This approximation has good
empirical performance, and can be justiÞed intuitively, since
a rigid body link between a and b should not have a major
effect on nodes prior to a.
IV. METHOD
We now present the SGD-MM (Stochastic Gradient
Descent-Max Mixtures) algorithm, along with a description
of some practical implementation details. We also present
the hybrid SGD-Cholesky-MM algorithm, which further ex-
plores the search space and improves performance on graphs
with ÒstrongÓ false local minima.
A. SGD-MM
For a given edge between nodes a and b, the correction
x is distributed amongb a nodes, so the total corrections
is scaled byb a. Correction is distributed according to the
information matrix J
T

 1
J, so that less conÞdent nodes
(smaller information matrix entries) get more correction,
while more conÞdent nodes get less correction. Since it
would be computationally expensive to build the information
matrix, we instead approximate it using a diagonal matrix
M, as shown in the Þrst part of Algorithm 1. The diagonal
terms of each W are summed so that M
j
approximates the
j
th
diagonal block of J
T

 1
J. This can be viewed as a
preconditioning step to improve the convergence of gradient
descent, where M is a diagonal preconditioning matrix.
This implementation introduces a different scaling term

, which scales the correction by the largest value of

, the Hessian term in the Gauss-Newton algo-
rithm. This scaling ensures that high conÞdence measure-
ments with small covariances will not cause extremely large
corrections. Finally, the magnitude ofs is clamped according
to the observation T
ab
. Since we can calculate the value
of s that will exactly satisfy the constraint, we can prevent
gradient descent from drastically overshooting.
B. Learning Rate
The learning rate  has a signiÞcant effect on the per-
formance of stochastic gradient descent. When  is high,
the solver takes large steps through the search space and
is more likely to jump between different local minima. We
ensure convergence by using a learning rate schedule that
decays over time. SpeciÞcally we use the harmonic series
 =
0
=t, where t is the iteration number, as suggested by
Robbins and Monro [14].
This leaves the initial learning rate
0
as a free parameter.
In a sense, this parameter captures how much exploration
will be performed on a pose graph. This is not a computable
quantity, but we can characterize some of the variables that
make a graph more complex: the amount of initialization
noise, the total path length, and the covariances of the edge
constraints. We experimentally found an initial learning rate
that worked well for the majority of our datasets, but it is
difÞcult to generally prescribe a way of choosing 
0
.
Other learning rate schedules include ÒSearch Then Con-
vergeÓ [15], which formalizes the intuitive notion of separate
exploration and convergence phases. However, since the
harmonic learning rate schedule seemed to work for a variety
of graphs, we did not attempt to use more sophisticated rate
schedules.
C. Implementation and Running Time
Although useful for the derivation above, in practice we do
not need to store the individual values as ( _ x
i
; _ y
i
;
_

i
). Instead,
we store the pose normally as (x;y;) and use an error-
distribution tree [13]. The error-distribution tree efÞciently
distributes correction among a contiguous range of states,
achieving the same effect as the incremental representation
while storing poses in the more useful global representation.
Suppose we have a pose graph withN nodes andE edges.
The asymptotic complexity of each iteration is determined
by the loops which iterate over each edge (lines 8-14 and
22-29), since E N in a pose graph. Inside both of these
loops, some amount of correction is added to a contiguous
block of nodes from a + 1 to b (lines 11-13 and 28). The
error distribution tree allows us to accomplish this operation
in (logN) time. Each pose can also be computed from the
error distribution tree in (logN) time. Therefore, the run-
ning time of each SGD step (lines 23-28) is still (logN),
and the running time of each iteration is (E logN).
D. SGD-Cholesky-MM
For many pose graphs, SGD-MM produces useful so-
lutions on its own. It may also be used to bootstrap the
Cholesky-MM solver, a Gauss-Newton based method. The
SGD-MM optimization procedure is good at performing
a rough alignment of poses, while the Cholesky solverÕs
quadratic convergence is ideal for quickly Þnding the nearest
local minimum. At a Þxed interval, it takes the graph
produced by SGD and runs Cholesky until convergence (or
divergence). Our algorithm repeatedly runs this procedure,
keeping the reÞned graph with the lowest
2
error. This best-
so-far policy allows us to compensate for SGDÕs tendency
to jump between local minima.
Since the Þrst solution is exactly the same solution re-
turned by Cholesky-MM, its worst-case performance is no
worse than Cholesky-MM. We will later show that this
procedure produces signiÞcantly better graphs than either
SGD-MM or Cholesky-MM, and will offer some reasons
based on an analysis of the failure cases.
V. RESULTS
Our results come from synthetically-generated ÒManhat-
tanÓ worlds as well as real-world data from the Intel dataset.
Our primary claim is that our method increases robustness to

graphs where this is not true, so the bulk of our analysis is
based on large numbers of random graphs so that we can
statistically characterize the beneÞts of our approach.
A. Manhattan Worlds
In the Manhattan world experiment, we evaluated both
variants of SGD against Cholesky-MM and switchable con-
straints on a 1000-graph dataset. (To evaluate switchable
constraints, we used the authorsÕ original implementation in
the g2o framework [16].) Each graph was corrupted with
increasing amounts of odometry noise. Fig. 1 shows the
result of one of these experiments.
Fig. 2 shows the result of this test for 1000 randomly-
generated graphs at increasing noise levels. Mean squared
distance error (MSE) compared to ground truth was used
to evaluate the map quality. SGD-MM was run until con-
vergence, which we deÞned as when the map changed an
average ofjxj < 0:001 over 500 iterations. A threshold
of MSE < 10 was used to designate a graph as correctly
solved. This corresponds to a map which is usable but not
necessarily metrically perfect.
An analysis of the performance gap between SGD-MM
and SGD-Cholesky-MM reveals a speciÞc weakness of both
iterative MM solutions, SGD and Cholesky. In many of the

failure case where the incorrect solution has a larger basin of

Cholesky-MM converge upon this incorrect solution most
often from a variety of poor initializations.
SGD-Cholesky-MM (Algorithm 2) is designed to improve
performance on such graphs by using SGD to generate
initializations for Cholesky-MM. Stochastic gradient descent
has the tendency to jump in and out of local minima.
Running Cholesky-MM to convergence fully explores these
local minima. Selecting the graph with lowest

error gives
preference to ÒbetterÓ local minima, even if its basin of
convergence is not as large. This is responsible for the
improvement over either Cholesky-MM and SGD-MM alone.
B. Intel Dataset
Our test run on the Intel dataset demonstrates the ap-
plicability of our method to real-world data. SGD-MM is
able to Þnd the true solution and achieve the precision
necessary to generate a map (Fig. 4). Since SGD-Cholesky-
MM solution converges faster upon the true minimum, it
produces a somewhat more reÞned map.
C. Ring and Ring City Datasets
The Ring and Ring City datasets introduced in [17]
illustrate an extreme example where the true solution has
a minimal basin of convergence. In this case, we expect
Cholesky-MM to fail since its initial position is already in
a strong local minimum. SGD methods are more willing to

Cholesky-MM fails because the graphs start in a stable local
minimum. Because SGD methods are more willing to depart
from local minima, they are more robust to ring-type failures.

SGD-MM has reduced the initial error by about 80% before
Cholesky-MM has Þnished its Þrst iteration. (SGD-MM takes

depart from local minima and explore the search space, as
shown in Fig. 5. SGD-Cholesky-MM is able to correctly
close the loop for the Ring dataset. The Ring City dataset
is even more challenging since the true solution requires
closing many such ring-type loops, and SGD-Cholesky-MM
is not able to close all the loops. However, SGD-based
methods show increased robustness to ring-type failures,
a speciÞc case of graphs with strong local minima that
Cholesky-MM cannot solve.
D. CSW Dataset
We use the CSW dataset [4] to evaluate the running time of
our algorithm. CSW is a Manhattan graph with 3500 nodes
and 5600 edges. We expect Cholesky-MM to slow down
considerably, since the false loop closures cause increased
Þll-in of the information matrix. SGD-MM is unaffected by
Þll-in, since its runtime grows as (E logN) without regard
to the sparsity of the information matrix. As shown in Fig. 6,
SGD-MM reduces error more quickly than Cholesky-MM.
VI. CONCLUSION
We have presented two variants of an SGD solver for
robust max-mixture pose graphs that performs well even
from poor initializations. SGD-MM can stand alone as a
computationally efÞcient solver for graphs with low initial
error. SGD-Cholesky-MM greatly extends the effectiveness
of the max-mixtures model on graphs with difÞcult local
minima. Our evaluation characterizes the performance of
these two methods and provides some insight into the struc-
ture of max-mixtures graph optimization problems.
