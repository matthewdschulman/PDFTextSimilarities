Time-Based RRT Algorithm for Rendezvous Planning of Two Dynamic
Systems
Avishai Sintov and Amir Shapiro
AbstractÑThe work presented in this paper proposes a new
method for time based motion planning of a dynamic system
to reach a dynamical goal within a speciÞed time. The method
enables trajectory planning based on the dynamics of the system
with time constraint. Moreover, this method allows rendezvous
planning of two dynamic systems where only one is controlled.
To reach this objective, we introduce a new concept termed
Time-Based RRT (TB-RRT) which is an extended version of
the Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT). The concept of the
TB-RRT is to add time parameters to the nodes in the tree such
that each node denotes a speciÞc state in a speciÞc time. The
algorithm was implemented in two applications to demonstrate
the approach and validate its feasibility; The Þrst application
is a one degree of freedom bat hitting a ball and the second
application is a three degrees of freedom manipulator catching
a moving object. Simulation results show the system accurately
following the planned trajectory and the robot catching the
object in time.
I. INTRODUCTION
Many applications in robotics demand not only motion
planning of a feasible trajectory for a robot to move from
one state (conÞguration and velocity) to another, but demand
also that it should be completed within a speciÞc time.
Such applications range from industrial and civil areas to
military ones. In industrial production lines, robotic arms
could regrasp parts by tossing them in the air and catching
them in a desired conÞguration. Flying drones could be
catchedinairinsteadofperforminglandingtoavoidstructure
damage due to the landing shocks. Performing car passing
on road by an autonomous car should be done within a set
time range to avoid collision. All of these applications and
moredemandthatthetrajectorywilltakeintoaccountanother
uncontrolled dynamic system (referred in this paper as the
dynamic goal) in a speciÞc time.
To deal with the presented problem, two main aspects are to
be considered; the Þrst is the time-based trajectory planning

problem of the uncontrolled dynamic goal to estimate its
trajectory. In this work we focus on the Þrst aspect and
assumefullknowledgeofthegoalstrajectory,thatis,accurate
measurement and prediction of the objects position and
velocity at all times.
The trajectory planning problem has been widely researched.
The most common methods for time based trajectory plan-
ning are the point to point polynomial trajectories and cubic
splines [1]. However, these methods do not take the dynamics
and constraints of the system into account. PotentialÞelds are
also a known method for path planning [2]. However, speciÞc
time constraints are not taken into account. Many other works
presents trajectory planning under cost minimization such as
jerk [3] or time [4]. Another method is the Rapidly-exploring
Random Tree (RRT) [5] which is a probabilistic method
for trajectory planning in a complex environment taking the
dynamics of the system into account. The RRT approach is
the base approach of this work.
Another problem dealt in this paper is rendezvous planning
of two dynamic systems where only one is controlled. Many
solutions to this problem were presented; The proportional
navigation algorithm [6], [7] is a commonly used method to
account for a moving object such as a UAV or a missile. The
algorithm is shown to be complete as it will intercept the
object in Þnite time, however not in a speciÞc desired time.
Many other rendezvous algorithms for optimal trajectories
werepresented[8],[9]toÞndthebesttrajectoryinadynamic
environment.
In the presented work we wish to address two main problems.
The Þrst problem is trajectory planning to reach a goal in
a speciÞc desired time. To solve this problem we present
the Time-Based RRT (TB-RRT) method which incorporates
the advantages of the known RRT with time constraint. The
other problem is the rendezvous planning of a controlled
dynamic system with an uncontrolled one. To solve the
second problem we use the TB-RRT and sample the goals
trajectory into the trees space.
The paper is organized as follows. Section II deÞnes the
problem discussed in this paper. Section III reviews the RRT
algorithm. In Section IV we present our algorithm forÞnding
a trajectory to a dynamic goal using a time based RRT
algorithm. In Section V we present some applications for
the method with two simulations of a bat hitting a ball and
a manipulator catching a moving object. We conclude and
suggest some future work in Section VI.

III. RRT BACKGROUND
The basic RRT algorithm wasÞrstly introduced by LaValle
[5] as a stochastic approach for trajectory planning to reach a
goal state from an initial state under a differential constraint
(such as in eq. (1)). The advantage of this method is in
its simplicity of applying multiple constraints and avoiding
obstacles.
The basics of the simple RRT algorithm is by sampling
random states and extending the RRT toward them. In every
iterationk, a random statex
rand
?X is sampled. Then,
a nearest-neighbor search Þnds the closest statex
k
in the
tree to the random point according to a deÞned metric?.
By applying an input|u

discretized and integrated here with a Þrst-order approxima-
tion. For better accuracy one can use an higher order method
such as the fourth-order Runge-Kutta. The new statex

could be terminated under two approaches; An upper bound
on the number of iterations will terminate the algorithm and
the best solution be taken based on some optimality criteria.
The second approach is a greedy one where the Þrst solution
found is taken. According to LaValle, the exploration rapidly
and uniformly covers the space and converge in a Þnite time.

IV. DYNAMIC MOTION PLANNING
In the previous section we presented the basic RRT
approach for kinodynamic planning. We now present the
Time-Based RRT (TB-RRT) to impose a time constraint for
reaching a dynamic goal.
A. State-Time Space
We expand the notion of the state space to contain varying
time. That is, we deÞne the State-Time Spacetobeaspace
where a time coordinate is added to the state coordinates of
the system. Therefore, a state-time vector is constructed as
÷ x=

x
T
t

T
(5)
where÷ x? R
n+1
. A state-time vector indicates the conÞg-
uration and velocity of a system at timet ? [0,°).The
state-time space is now denoted as
ö
X?R
n+1
.
With the new state-time vector we can now modify eq. (4)
to be
÷ x
k+1
=÷ x
k
+

f(÷ x
k
,u


?t. (6)
That is, the next node ÷ x
k+1
in the tree is updated to its
new time by adding ?t relative to its parent node ö x
k
.
Moreover, we constrain the new node in the tree to be in
the allowed state-time space, i.e.,÷ x
k+1
?
÷
X
free
. The region
of
÷
X

?
÷
X is acquired straight forward fromX
free
with
additional limitations on the time. Meaning, we can limit the
nodes in the tree to a time frame. Moreover,
÷
X
free
could be
used to model dynamic obstacles as it varies in time.
This representation of a state-time vector enables growing a
tree where each node has knowledge of its state at a speciÞc
time. Therefore, a goal state-time could be deÞned and a
trajectory could be planned by growing a tree, searching
for a node close enough to the goal state-time. A node is
considered to be close enough to a goal state if a predeÞned
metric?
?
(to be deÞned) is smaller than a speciÞed overall
tolerance. The tolerance must incorporate an allowed time
tolerance. Such method enables trajectory planning reaching
a goal in a desired time with the time tolerance accuracy.

B. State-Time of the Dynamic Goal
We now need to refer to the matter of the dynamic goal. As
mentioned, we assume full knowledge of the goals dynamics.
That is,q(t)?X?t?[0,t

] could be fully predicted. The
basic idea is to sample the goals trajectory in?t

C. Time-Based RRT
In the previous subsections we have deÞned the state-time
space and the sampling strategy for the dynamic goal. We
presenthowtheTB-RRTisgrown.Thealgorithmproposedis
a greedy one which stops once a solution is found. However,
it could be expanded to Þnd an optimized one by Þnding all
solutions inK iterations and choosing the one which best
minimizes some optimization criteria.
Algorithm 1 presents the main steps in expansion of the TB-
RRT and searching for a trajectory from initial state-time÷ x
o
to any goal state-time÷ q
i
?
÷
X
goal
. Similar to the original
RRT algorithm, the treeT is initialized with the start state-
time (step 1). The FOR loop (steps 2-15) is set to run a
predeÞned number of iterationsK. This enables the user to
limit the run in terms of runtime or memory usage. However,
the FOR loop could be replaced by an inÞnite loop as there
is a stoping condition to terminate the run once a solution
is found. The algorithm samples a random state-time vector
÷ x
rand
(step 3) within
÷
X and Þnds its nearest node÷ x
i
?T
to it (step 4). An inputu
i
is selected to impose motion from
÷ x
i
towards÷ x
rand
(step 5). That is, by applying the chosen
inputu
i
on the differential constraint of eq.(6), we obtain a
new node÷ x
i+1
. The control inputu
i
will be chosen such
that÷ x

direction and magnitude is feasible (steps 7-14). Therefore,
we check if the new node÷ x

the new node to the tree and stores connection between÷ x

the algorithm continues to a new iteration.

considered as the same. Most implementation of the RRT use
the simple Euclidean metric between two vectors. However,
such metric does not take into account the unit difference in
the state-time vector components. It is problematic to treat
angle units and time units with the same weight. Therefore,
our criterion for two vectors to be considered to the same is if
they are both within an hyper-rectangle (inn+1 dimension).
The size of the hyper-rectangle is deÞned by the allowed
tolerance vector. Each components unit in respectively
correspond to the state-time vectorö x.WedeÞne our metric

If the above condition is true, a node in the tree was
found which is close enough to a state-time vector in

Therefore, theÞnal step will be toÞnd a path in the tree from
its root (the initial state-time) to the goal node (step 11). This
could be done with any tree search algorithms such asA
?
,
DFS, BFS, etc [10].
Figure 3 presents a TB-RRT of a pendulum and its trajectory
toward a static goal. A funnel shape tree could be seen
starting from the initial state-time. For each node, its siblings
could only be in direction where time increases. That is, the
tree is constructed such that the system can reach many states
in the tree and time will always increase. The box at the goal
state-time illustrates the allowed tolerance of the algorithm.

The next section provides some example applications for the
algorithm and presents simulations validating the method.
V. APPLICATIONS AND SIMULATIONS
In this section we present two applications and simulations
of the method: the Þrst is a simple one degree of freedom
bat hitting a moving ball, the second is a motion planning
of a three degrees of freedom manipulator to catch a moving
object. A performance analysis is then presented.
A. One degree bat hitting a ball
The Þrst simulation we conducted was applying the TB-
RRT method to a one degree of freedom bat rotating on an
horizontal plane. The bat with massm=2kg and length
l=0.2m has the following equation of motion:

. The motor at the axis of the
bat can only apply torque up to|u

|=2Nm.
The batÕs goal is to hit a planar ball moving on a straight
line with constant velocity. That is, the goals differential

sentation should be transformed to a state-time space with
reference to the bat. The position of the ball is transformed
to polar coordinates where the angle denotes the angle the bat
should have in order to hit the ball. The state-time tolerance

T
. For demonstration purpose
and to demonstrate a full state goal, we set a constraint that at
encounter, the bat will have the linear velocity at the contact
point opposite but equal to the balls velocity component
perpendicular to the bat. The offset of bat relative to the
balls center due to the balls radius was taken into account.
The motion of the ball was sampled only where it is located
in the quarter circle representing the bats work space.
Under these properties and constraints, the algorithm was
simulated and after 1,726 iterations outputted the TB-RRT
shown in Figure 4. The green circles mark the sampled state-
time vectors of the ball. The red curve presents the path
solution from the initial state time to the goal one.
The algorithm outputted a set of discrete states in time and a
set of control inputs. We may use the control inputs directly
for the motor with no feedback control on the trajectory
position. However, for overcoming disturbances and errors
there is a need for feedback control. Therefore, we use the
set of discrete states in time as the reference trajectory to a
closed loop PD controller as seen in Figure 5. The TB-RRT
planner outputs the desired trajectory from the initial state-
timetotheÞnal.Thereferencesignalisthenfedintoasimple

closed loop control input to the dynamic system. Figure 6
presents the trajectory of the bat. The dashed curve is the
trajectory from the TB-RRT planner. The continues curve

ballÕs trajectory could also be seen as the dotted curve. The
ballÕs curve starts at 0.46s because only then it enters the
workspace of the bat. Rendezvous between the curves show

B. Manipulator catching a moving object
In the second simulation we used a more complex dynam-
ics. A vertical planar three degrees of freedom manipulator
was chosen. Its dynamics is given by the following equation
of motion

wherez(t)=[?

is the joint conÞguration,M(z)
is the inertia matrix,C(z,úz) is the matrix of coriolis and

the control input vector. The masses of the links arem

we perform order reduction such thatx

The manipulators goal is to catch a moving object such that
at the moment of rendezvous the end-effector will have the
same velocity (magnitude and direction) as the object. The
object was given an arbitrary polynomial trajectory given by

is the objects state. This polynomial
representation can be used to simulate the dynamics of
a free ßying object with the inßuence of gravitation and
air drag damping. The goal objects differential constraint
should be transformed to the state-time space as described.
However, the manipulator state space is represented based
on the joint angles and the object is based on its cartesian
position. Therefore, the objects state space is transformed to
the manipulators state space using the inverse kinematics of
the manipulator. That is, the new sampled state spaceq

sition to the joints conÞguration andJ is the Jacobian matrix

space.
Figure 8 presents a simulated trajectory of the manipulator
to grasp the moving object. The trajectory was calculated
with the TB-RRT algorithm and generated this solution
after 21,988 iterations. In this case, after 0.4 seconds the
manipulator was able to reach the object with the same
velocity. Figure 9 presents snapshots of the manipulators
motion to catch the moving object. It should be mentioned
that a method to avoid collisions of the manipulators links
were not implemented but could be done in the future by
excluding parts of the state-time space from

C. Analysis
Table I shows some performance results of the presented
simulations. Runtime and iteration number statistics is shown
after 10 simulation runs. Runtime is increased as well as
the number of iterations when the state space dimension

increases. The simulation for the bat was done with time
tolerance of ±0.04 seconds. Figure 10 demonstrates the
sensitivity of the algorithm with reference to time toler-
ance increase. Here, decrease in the runtime and number
of iterations can be seen as the time tolerance grow. As
expected, with larger tolerances more solutions could be
found, however, with less accuracy.
VI. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper we have presented an approach for trajectory
planning under speciÞc time constraint. Moreover, we have
extended the approach for rendezvous planning between a
controlled dynamic system and an uncontrolled one. The

TB-RRT approach was presented building a probabilistic
tree in the deÞned state-time space, taking the dynamics of
the systems into account. Simulations of typical applications
were shown to demonstrate and validate the method.
Further work on this approach should deal with computa-
tion time of expanding the tree to enable real-time planning.
Such work should address decreasing the complexity of
nearest neighbor search algorithms. Another approach could
be real-time expansion of the existing TB-RRT based on
feedback data only in regions which are relevant to the
systems motion.
