Abstract— In the past we achieved to use a rat-like robot
and a single rat to develop Animal Models of Mental Disorder
(AMMDs) through stress exposure. However, to simulate the
real social environment, we use a rat-like robot composed of
multiple links to chase a speciﬁc rat (target) in a group of
rats (outside observers). In this paper, we aim to develop a
real-time control system for a multi-link robot surrounded
by multiple rats. A virtual impedance model was adopted to
generate posture and trajectory for a multi-link robot named
WR-5. With the analysis of virtual forces/moments acting on
WR-5 based on the model, corresponding dynamic equations
can be obtained to control the motion of WR-5. Simulation
results show that the head of WR-5 can accurately direct a
target object in the following test. After conducting experiments
with three rat subjects (a target rat, two outside observers),
the output results suggest that the head and body gesture of
WR-5 achieves to follow the target in real-time. Meanwhile, the
control system allows real-time avoidance of the moving outside
observers during interaction.
I. INTRODUCTION
Recently, bio-inspired robots have been greatly contribut-
ing to studies on animal behavior in ethology, animal psy-
chology, and behavioral biology [1]. Actually, biorobotics
provides tools for biologists studying animal behavior and
test beds for the study and evaluation of biological algorithms
for potential engineering applications. Speciﬁcally, use of
these bio-inspired robots offers novel methodologies to study
response of an animal to the stimulus from the same species
or other species. For instance, these bio-inspired robots are
used to understand decision making of an individual or a
group of animals such as insects [2], [3], [4], [5], birds [6],
ﬁshes [7], and rodents [8].
On the other hands, experiments on animal behavior have
been playing a very important role in psychic medicine [9],
[10], [11], [12], [13]. All psychotropic drugs have been
evaluated in experiments with Animal Models of Mental
The experimental protocol was discussed and agreed in advance with
the Ethical Committee of Waseda University and with the other institutions
involved. This work was in part supported by the grants of MEXT (Grant-in-
Aid for Young Scientists (B) 25730161 and Global COE Program “Global

Disorder (AMMDs) before used in clinical practice [9].
These experiments are called drug screening test. AMMDs
are living animals that represent phenotypes of human pa-
tients with mental disorders. In general, they are produced
based on genetic manipulation [14], nerve surgery [15],
or stressful environment [16]. In a drug screening test,
a newly developed drug is administered into an animal
model, and its effect is then evaluated through behavior
observation. Rodents such as rats and mice are commonly
selected as experimental subjects in these tests due to their
genetic consistency and similarity with human beings in their
reaction to drugs. Recently, several new psychotropic drugs
are developed through these tests [12], [13]. However, some
researchers have mentioned the limitations of conventional
AMMDs because of low predictive validity (performance
in the test predicts performance in the condition being
modeled), face validity (phenomenological similarity) and
construct validity (theoretical rationale) [17]. We proposed to
use robot technology to break through these limitations in the
drug screening test [18], [19]. In this method, animal models
of depression can be developed by exposing continuous
attack from a robot in immature period and interactive attack
in mature period. This method is conﬁrmed to be able to
develop AMMDs with construct validity and face validity.
In our previous research, the stress exposure tests are per-
formed with one robot and one rat. However, rats are social
animals, gaining much enjoyment and stimulation from each
other’s company [20]. They live in large family groups in
the wild. So rats may interact with the robot in a more
natural way if kept with more companions. As proposed in
this paper, we put a robot together with multiple rats. In this
novel stress exposure system, the robot continuously attacks
a speciﬁc rat (we call it as a target rat). The other rats are
considered as outside observers, which should be avoided
by the robot during the experiment. Therefore the motion
planning of the robot can be regarded as chasing the target
rat and simultaneously avoiding outside observers. There
are many examples in the ﬁeld of self-collision avoidance
control [21], [22], [23]. Especially some algorithms were
able to generate optimal trajectory for a small mobile robot,
for instance, potential ﬁeld method (PFM) [22], voronoi
diagram method (VDM) [23]. However, the computational
cost of PFM is very high in case of avoiding multiple
dynamic obstacles, resulting in severe delay. VDM can be
implemented very fast though, it is not suitable to control
the posture of a rat-like robot consisting of multiple links.
To solve these above-mentioned shortcomings, we adopt

a virtual impedance model ([24], [25]) to build a real-time
control system for a rat-like robot to interact with multiple
rats. With the analysis of virtual forces/moments acting on
WR-5 based on the model, corresponding dynamic equations
can be obtained to control the motion of WR-5, acting with
optimal posture and trajectory. Simulation results showed
that the head of WR-5 can accurately towards a target object
in the following test. Furthermore, we put WR-5 together
with three rat subjects (a target rat, two outside observers) to
validate this model. Experimental results suggest that WR-5
achieves to adjust its posture to chase the target rat in real-
time. Meanwhile, the implementation of this control system
allows real-time avoidance of the moving outside observers
during interaction.
This paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we
present a description of the robotic platform and virtual
impedance model based control method. In Section III, we
experimentally and analytically study the control system, and
perform experiments and analysis of robot-rat interaction.
Finally, conclusions and future work are summarized in
Section IV .
II. MATERIALS AND METHODS
A. Robot Agent
Building on the experiences gained from previous robot
prototypes, we developed a novel rat-like robot named WR-
5 as shown in Fig.1 (size: 7024090 mm, weight: 0.8 kg)
[26]. The body framework and DOF conﬁguration of WR-
5 was determined with analysis of X-ray structure of rat
behavior. The skeleton structure of WR-5 is represented by
the DOF arrangement as depicted in Fig.2: 13 active DOFs
and 2 passive DOFs in the paws. Performance evaluation
conﬁrmed that WR-5 could perform both rearing and ro-
tating actions faster than live mature rats, which endowed
WR-5 with almost the same motion performance as rats.
The interaction experiments between WR-5 and mature rats
have been conducted strictly following psychological rules.
Experimental results showed that rats were more active and
had fewer frequencies of body grooming and rearing actions
when WR-5 performed mounting action periodically. The rat-
like robot was therefore able to make the anxiety level of rats
high by means of performing mounting action.

described in Section.II-B. (See also Fig.3)
Besides, to recognize and analyze rat behavior automati-
cally, we furnished the robot with a recognition system [27]
based on image processing and classiﬁcation techniques. In
the recognition system, basic image processing algorithms
as Labeling and Contour Finding were employed to extract
feature parameters such as body area, circularity, rotational
angle and speed to discriminate rat behavior. These feature
parameters served as the input vector of Support Vector Ma-
chine (SVM) for classiﬁcation. Experimental results revealed
that the rearing, body grooming and rotating actions could be
classiﬁed with more than 90% accuracy by this recognition
system, which was sufﬁcient for the analysis of rat behavior.
B. Virtual Impedance Model
As shown in Fig.2, there are 3 DOFs in the yaw direction.
WR-5 can therefore be divided into four links (l
1
0
: head-
neck, l
2
1
and l
3
2
: waist, l
4
3
: hip). A virtual impedance model
is adopted to generate posture and trajectory for WR-5.
The model deﬁnes virtual masses, springs, dampers between
the links l
i+1
i
of WR-5 (Fig.3). The model determines the
motion of each link by means of virtual force. It consists of
three parts: the force generated between the robot and the
target rat, the force generated between two links, the force
generated between a link and a outside observer. To better
understand this model, ﬁrst we explain a simple case: the
robot put together with one outside observer and one target
rat. The outside observer generates repulsive forces F
r
i
to
all the joints, while the target rat only generates attractive
force F
a
to the head. As shown in the following equations,
the virtual forces are determined by the distance between rat
subjects and the robot.

Finally, regarding the hip part, a virtual spring-damper

However, when the robot head goes very near to the target

introduced to stop the robot. Here we assume that v

III. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION AND
EXPERIMENTS
A. Performance Evaluation
We developed a simple simulated environment: a four-
link robot and a circle target surrounded by a 700700 mm
open ﬁeld. The target moves in a circle path at a speed
of 0.3 m/s, while the robot is simulated to continuously
follow it. The posture and trajectory of the simulated robot
is generated based on the virtual impedance model. We
tracked the position data of the simluated robot and the
target (the blue line in Fig.7(a)), and the angle of hip part
with x-axis 
x
w
(the blue line in Fig.7(b)). These results
show that the simulated robot was able to closely chase the
978
Fig. 9. Screenshot of the robot-rat interaction experiment. The multi-link robot WR-5 is able to adjust its posture to directly towards the
direction of the green rat (target). In the meantime, WR-5 can adjust its posture to avoid the cyan and red rats (outside observers).
target. Additionally, we conducted similar experiments by
putting WR-5 in a real 700700 mm open ﬁeld. WR-5 was
controlled to follow a virtual target moving in a circle path,
its trajectory and rotational angle
x
w
were measured as well
(the red line in Fig.7). The trajectory of WR-5 is quite similar
to the simulated robot, conﬁrming the effectiveness of this
control method.
To verify the effectiveness of proposed control method,
the WR-5 was used to chase real rats as well. We used
three 9-week old F344/Jcl male rats in this experiment. The
experimental arena referred to as the open-ﬁeld which is
a ﬂat 700700 mm, surrounded by a wooden wall with
a height of 600 mm (Fig.8). The three rats were colored
with red, cyan and green respectively for classiﬁcation. Based
on image processing, positions of the rats and WR-5 could
be detected by a CCD camera (resolution:640320 pixels)
installed at the top of the open ﬁeld. Receiving generated
posture and trajectory from a external control PC, WR-5
could autonomously chase a speciﬁc rat (the target that is
colored with green here).
As shown in Fig.9, for each test WR-5 was continuously
chasing the green rat in the open ﬁeld. Simultaneously, WR-
5 was trying to avoid the cyan and red rats. The tests were
repeatedly conducted 6 times in total. Based on the positions
of the rats and WR-5, we calculated their distances in each
one-minute interval (Fig.10). For the mean distance to WR-
5, the green rat had the lowest value in every minute, which
was ranged from 25.5 cm to 40.9 cm. Whereas that of the
red and cyan rats was from 49.1 cm to 70.3 cm, and from
55.3 cm to 66.9 cm, respectively.
In summary, both simulation and actual following tests
demonstrate that the virtual impedance model based control
system allows the robot to keep on chasing a speciﬁc target
in real-time. In particular, the posture of the robot head
was controlled to aim at the target rat all the time, greatly
improving the similarity with the posture of real rats. It
therefore gives the possibility that our method can be used
to control the posture and trajectory of the rat-like robot
to better mimic real rats. The control method also enables
the robot to avoid other outside observers in real time.
Especially, during the experiment we found that the robot
can adjust its posture to avoid dynamic obstacles (moving
outside observers). Thus this control system can be used for
the control of the posture and trajectory of a rat-like robot
consisting of multiple links. Besides, during following test
the outside observers felt fear to the robot at the beginning.
However, they might show interest to the robot when they
were aware of not being attacked. As shown in Fig.11, the
gradually reduced distance between the outside observers
(red and cyan rats) and WR-5 improves this possibility.
Conversely, the target rat seemed to feel helpless during the
chasing process. Compared with the AMMDs developed in
a environment with one robot and one rat [18], much more
stress might be induced in the rat receiving such kind of
chasing. The idea that exposing stress to a speciﬁc rat in
a group of rats promises to be a more effective method to
develop AMMDs. Thus it can be further used for application
in screening of psychotropic drugs.
IV. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORKS
To imitate the social environment for rats, we proposed to
use multiple rats to interact with a rat-like robot. Based on

a virtual impedance model, a real-time control system was
developed to generate the posture and trajectory for a rat-
like robot composed of multiple links. With the analysis of
virtual forces/moments acting on WR-5 based on the model,
corresponding dynamic equations can be obtained to control
the motion of WR-5. Simulation results show that the head
of WR-5 can accurately towards a target object during the
following test. Furthermore, WR-5 was put together with
three real rats (a target rat, two outside observers) to validate
this model. Experimental results demonstrate that WR-5 can
adjust its head and body gesture to follow the target rat in
real time. Meanwhile, the control system allows real-time
avoidance of the moving outside observers during interaction.
However, current robot system is still improvable espe-
cially in the following aspects. First, the control method
should be optimized to allow the robot to act more sim-
ilarly to a real rat. Furthermore, we need to evaluate the
effectiveness of the motion similarity to real rats. When
the effectiveness of motion similarity is conﬁrmed, we can
then perform the robot-rat interaction in a more natural way.
For the future realistic application, we can output agonistic
behavior to interact with multiple rats to develop AMMDs.
