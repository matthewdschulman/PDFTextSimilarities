Abstract— This paper presents a novel visual servoing con-
troller for a satellite mounted dual-arm space robot. The con-
troller is designed to complete the task of servoing the robot’s
endeffectors to the desired pose, while regulating orientation
of the base-satellite. Task redundancy approach is utilized to
coordinate the servoing process and attitude of the base satellite.
The visual task is deﬁned as a primary task, while regulating
attitude of the base satellite to zero is deﬁned as a secondary
task. The secondary task is formulated as an optimization
problem in such a way that it does not affect the primary
task, and simultaneously minimizes its cost function. A set of
numerical experiments are carried out on a dual-arm space
robot showing efﬁcacy of the proposed control methodology.
I. INTRODUCTION
One of the major areas in space science that demands for
immediate attention and commercial drive is the On Orbit
Services (OSS) [1], e.g., orbital detritus management, refur-
bishment and refuelling of orbiting satellites, construction
in space, etc. The OSS can be divided into rendezvous,
proximity operations, and servicing. Use of robots boosts
reliability, safety and ease of execution of operations during
or after proximity operations [2]. It is highly desired that
the closing over manoeuvre of the robot is carried out
autonomously due to communication time delay between
the service satellite and ground station [3]. This calls for
a control technique which makes use of the on-board ma-
chine vision facility for successfully completing OOS in an
autonomous manner. Visual servoing is one such vision-
based technique commonly used for control of the earth-
based robots, and have made many recent progresses [4], [5],
[6], [7]. In this work, we attempt to solve a visual servoing
problem for a satellite mounted space robot.
Visual servoing is inevitable for the space robots due
to communication time delay [3]. Moreover, variable light
conditions, absence of marker, and limited computing power
make visual servoing further challenging [8]. Visual servoing
was demonstrated for autonomous satellite capture in [3].
Later, they [8] showed visual servoing under limited avail-
ability of computing power and severe lighting conditions.
Earth-based experimental evaluation for robotic capture of a
helium airship using visual servoing was illustrated in [9].
There, the objective was to emulate capture of a free-ﬂoating
object without emphasizing on effect of the robot’s motion

on the satellite. In the above works [3], [8], [9], satellite
is either assumed to be controlled or operated in the free-
ﬂoating mode. Use of attitude controller will consume fuel
which is reserved mainly for orbital manoeuvres.
Robot’s operation in the free-ﬂoating mode using the
Generalized Jacobian Matrix (GJM) [10] is an another alter-
native. This although helps in reducing fuel consumption but
causes change in the orientation of the base satellite. This
may destabilise the satellite, cause damage to its internal
hardware, and result in loss of communication with data
relay satellite or ground station. Regulating attitude of the
base satellite to zero in the free-ﬂoating mode is another
objective of this work along with visual servoing.
In this regard, several researchers have focused on robotic
manipulation with minimum attitude disturbance of the base
satellite. This is also known as reactionless manipulation
of robotic arm. This not only helps in keeping attitude
disturbances minimum but also results into fuel saving. In
this regard, the disturbance maps were proposed [11] to
minimise change in the base attitude, but were not able to
completely eliminate it. A Reaction Null Space (RNS) based
formulation was also proposed in [12] which led to zero
attitude disturbances of the base satellite. Recently, strategies
for reactionless capture of tumbling objects using a dual-
arm robot were proposed in [13]. These works, however,
stressed on reactionless path planning without emphasizing
on vision-based control. In this work, we introduce a vision-
based control for reactionless manipulation of a dual-arm
robot. In our proposal, both visual servoing and reaction-
less manipulation are treated as different tasks. Multi-task
approach was presented in [14] for visual servoing of an
earth-based Cartesian robot with joint-limit and singularity
avoidance as the additional tasks using gradient projection
method. Success of such approach depends on proper tuning
of a parameter that decides amplitude of secondary task.
In order to overcome this disadvantage, an iterative scheme
was presented for joint limit avoidance as a secondary task
in [15]. Both the above methods required free degrees-of-
freedom (DOF) for secondary task. An improved task func-
tion approach was illustrated in [16], where the secondary
task exploits DOF constrained by the main task in addition
to the redundant DOF for faster completion of the task. The
success of task functional approach on the earth-based robots
inspired to use it for space robot.
However, implementation of visual servoing as the primary
task and reactionless manipulation as the secondary task
is a non-trivial problem for space robot mainly due to,
1) dynamic coupling between two arms and satellite, and
2) nonholonomic nature of the constraints for reactionless

manipulation. In this work, a solution is proposed for the ﬁrst
two problems, which form the fundamental contributions of
this work. The efﬁcacy of the proposed approach is illustrated
using a 6-DOF planar dual-arm robotic system mounted on
a service satellite.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: The Gen-
eralized Jacobian for a dual-arm space robot is presented
in Section II. Visual servoing using the GJM is presented in
Section III, whereas reactionless visual servoing is discussed
in Section IV , Section V presents results and discussion.
Finally, conclusions are given in Section VI.
II. THE GENERALIZED JACOBIAN MATRIX (GJM)
In the proposed visual servoing, the base satellite is
assumed to be free ﬂoating, and hence, it is very important
to obtain the Jacobian that maps joint velocities into the
end-effectors’ velocities by incorporating motion of the base
satellite. For an n-DOF dual-arm robotic system mounted
on a ﬂoating-base with 2-end-effectors, as shown in Fig. 1,
the end-effectors’ velocities (t

dual-arm space robot in the subsequent sections.

III. VISUAL SERVOING OF A DUAL-ARM SPACE ROBOT
In contrast to the earth-based dual-arm robot, the dual-
arm space robot has coupled motion of arms and base
satellite. This is evident from (4) where mapping between
end-effectors’ velocity and joint rates is no more function of
mere kinematic parameters. Therefore, this section empha-
sizes on visual servoing of a dual-arm space robot without
reactionless manipulation.
Visual servoing uses signals extracted from visual infor-
mation as a feedback to close the control loop [17]. The
dual-arm robot carries one camera each on both arms, hence,
the visual servoing control law can be deﬁned as

is the twist

feature velocities in terms of joint velocities as the actuators
are placed at the joints.
For the dual-arm space robot, it is not possible to decouple
motion of the arms, and obtain two independent Jacobians.
As discussed in Section 2, the joint velocities of the space
robot can be mapped into end-effector velocities using the
GJM,J
g
, as given in (4). Therefore, (5) can be rewritten in
terms of joint velocities of arm-1 and arm-2 using (4) as

As there is no control on the motion of the base satellite,
this can result into attitude disturbance as will be shown in
Section V .
IV. REACTIONLESS VISUAL SERVOING CONTROL
As discussed in the previous section, the GJM-based visual
servoing in (7) leads to attitude disturbances. In this section,
a solution based on task function approach is proposed to
overcome the above disadvantage.
A. Task Function Approach for Reactionless Visual Servoing
Task function approach uses some DOFs for completion
of visual servoing task whereas redundant DOFs are used
for completion of additional tasks. In (6),e is designed as a
visual servoing task for the dual-arm robot. This is referred
to as the primary task. On the other hand regulating the
base attitude disturbance to zero is treated as the secondary
task and denoted as e
s
. Using the task function approach
[18], regulation of the primary and secondary robotic tasks
is formulated as
e
t
=J
+
1
e+(I
n
 J
+
1
J
1
)e
s
; (9)
where e
t
is the total robotic task. The projection operator
(I
n
 J
+
1
J
1
) ensures that the realization of the secondary
task,e
s
, does not affect the main task,e. In fact, the columns
of the operator (I
n
 J
+
1
J
1
) belongs to the null space
of J
1
. In (9), the value of  is critical and needs to be
accurately tuned [15]. Large value of will result into some
oscillations, while too small values may cause a steady state
error in the end effector velocity. The proposed solution to
the reactionless visual servoing takes care of tuning of .
It is done automatically within the optimization framework
that deﬁnes the secondary task. Finally, the visual servoing
control law in terms of joint velocities is obtained as
_
 = e
t

B. Deﬁning the Secondary Task
The secondary task is traditionally used in the robotic
literature to satisfy a set of constraints in addition to the main
task to be completed. These constraints are represented using
a cost function whose value is null when these constraints
are satisﬁed. Hence, the gradient of the cost function is used
as a secondary task to be regulated to zero during the main
task, i.e., the servoing task [15]. For the satellite mounted
dual-arm robot under study, the objective is to perform the
servoing without any base reaction moment. Hence, it will
be referred to as reactionless visual servoing. It is assumed
that the satellite is free to move along Cartesian axes. In
order to obtain constraints for reactionless manipulation, (2)
is ﬁrst rewritten only in terms of!
0
. Note that matricesI

andI

in (2) have the following block representation:

is referred to as coupling angular momentum.
It is clear from (15) that for a dual-arm robot, it is sum
of the coupling angular momenta of both arms, not of the
individual arms, has to be zero for reactionless manipulation.
Hence, the secondary cost function is taken as
h

.
Classical way to deﬁne the secondary task is the gradient
of the cost function, i.e.e
s
=@hs=@. However, here,h
s
is
nonholonomic and function of
_
, which is also the output of
visual servoing controller (10). Hence, the gradient cannot
be derived in terms of.
There are many alternatives to avoid the direct analytical
computation of the gradient [19]. For example, the gradient
can be locally estimated using numerical methods. Another
method is to consider the secondary task as a design variable
~ e
s
. This variable is estimated in such a way that it minimizes
the cost function h
s
. i.e.,
~ e
s
= argmin
es
(h

Using (9), (16) and (10), (17) can be rewritten as follows:

where e

parameter. The local optimization estimates both of them
as the parameter ~ e

that minimize the cost function h

. As
mentioned earlier, the parameter  is critical since it affects
the behaviour of the visual servoing control law. In this work,
no special procedure is required to estimated value of .

serving of a 6-DOF planar dual-arm robot is illustrated in
the next section.

V. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
In order to illustrate the proposed reactionless visual
servoing, a 6-DOF planar dual-arm robotic system mounted
on a service satellite is considered, as shown in Fig. 2.
The model parameters of the dual-arm and satellite are
shown in Table I. Each manipulator has 3-DOF and three
links connected by the revolute joints. The dual-arm is
placed in XY-plane, and the relative joint angles for both
arms are shown in Fig. 2. The end-effector of each arm
is mounted with a camera. Two points to be tracked are
placed at ( 0:5m;2m; 0:1m) and ( 0:5m;2m;0:1m).
The cameras observe the point features and the image co-
ordinates are extracted for the purpose of visual servoing.
The desired features are calculated based on the desired pose
of camera-1 and camera-2 as( 0:14m;1:78m;2:56rad) and
( 0:7m;;1:57m;1:04rad), respectively. In order to validate
the formulation developed in Sections III-IV , the following
numerical experiments were carried out:
 Case A: Visual servoing with the GJM-based control.
 Case B: Reactionless visual servoing with the aug-
mented GJM-based control and task function approach.
Results are obtained using space robot module of Recursive
Dynamics Simulator (ReDySim) [20], and elaborated in the

A. Case A: Visual servoing with the GJM-based control
In order to validate theory developed in Section III, and
to highlight the problems that needs to be mitigated in the
reactionless visual servoing, the GJM-based visual servoing
of the dual-arm robot is presented in this section. Here, the
attitude controller is assumed to be shut-off, and the base
satellite works in the free-ﬂoating mode. Next, the GJM-
based control law derived in (7) is applied. Since there is
no external force acting on the satellite, the total linear and
angular momenta are conserved. Therefore, any reaction due
to motion of the dual-arm causes change in the orientation
of the base satellite which is evident from Fig. 3, where the
maximum change in the orientation is 0:13rad, which is not
desired. Figure 4, however, shows successful visual servoing
where both norm of pixel error and joint rates for arm-1
converge to zero. Moreover, observed features (in blue) move
towards the desired features (in red) as depicted in Fig. 5.

In order to validate the results of numerical experiment, the
linear and angular momenta are plotted in Fig. 6. It can be
seen that they are of order 10
 4
. This conﬁrms correctness
of the simulation results as momentum is conserved.
B. Case B: Reactionless Visual Servoing
The problem of base attitude disturbance with the GJM-
based visual servoing has been brought forward through
the experiment illustrated in the previous section. In order
to overcome this disadvantage, the task function approach
proposed in Section IV is implemented for reactionless visual
servoing. For this, optimal control law derived in (18), which
ensures that the motion of the dual-arm does not affect the
base attitude, is used. It is worth noting that the modiﬁed
image JacobianJ
1
2R
86
has maximum rank equals to 6.
Here, as the two feature points are along vertical line in the
image plane, and the robot moves in a plane perpendicular
to the vertical line, the rank of J
1
is reduced by two, i.e.,
rank(J
1
) = 4. Hence, there exits a null space, dimension
of which is 2. This is utilized in designing the secondary
task. Figure 7 shows that the change in the orientation
of the base satellite is 1:2210
 6
rad using the proposed
method. This shows signiﬁcant improvement in comparison
to the previous subsection where the change in attitude of
the base satellite was 0:13rad. It can also be seen from
Fig. 8 that the norm of pixel error showing the performance
of primary task, and joint rates reduce to zero proving
successful visual servoing. This is also depicted in Fig. 9
where the observed feature (in blue) approached the desired
feature (in red). Cost of secondary task, i.e., coupling angular
momentum (
~
I
bm
_
), is also plotted in Fig. 10 with dashed line
and compared with the same for Case A, discussed in the
previous subsection. It can be seen that the maximum value
of
~
I
bm
_
 was 160:55Nm:s in the case of mere GJM-based
control (Case A) on the other hand it was reduced to only
1:710
 4
Nm:s in the case of reactionless visual servoing
(Case B). This shows efﬁcacy of the proposed control.
C. Performance Evaluation of the Proposed Algorithm
In order to evaluate performance of the proposed reac-
tionless visual servoing (Case B) in minimizing the base
attitude disturbance, six more numerical experiments have
been carried out with different initial conﬁgurations and

II. Note that the ﬁrst experiment is the one discussed in the
previous two subsections.
Table II clearly shows that for Case B, the end result
of primary task, i.e., pixel error, is not inﬂuenced by both
presence of the secondary task and variation of initial condi-
tions. This shows robustness of the method in completing the
primary task. It can also be seen that in Case A the maximum
value of coupling angular momentum was 1414:6Nm:s
(Experiment 5), where as the same for case B was 251.52

Nm:s. This shows effectiveness of the proposed
approach in successful completion of the secondary task in
all the seven experiments. This fact is also evident from
the values of maximum change in the attitude of the base
satellite, which was limited to0:5rad in Case A, whereas the

VI. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper a reactionless visual servoing has been
proposed for a dual-arm robotic system mounted on a
service satellite. Alignment of the robot’s endeffectors is
very important while performing any On Orbit Services
(OSS). This is done through visual servoing to overcome
any communication delay between the earth-based station
and the satellite. The importance of the attitude control of
the base satellite is emphasised in detail, and the problem
is solved using the augmented Generalized Jacobian Matrix
(GJM) based control and task function approach. For this,
visual servoing is considered as a primary task, whereas
minimization of the attitude disturbance is assumed as a
secondary task. Cost function for the secondary task is
formulated using conservation of angular momentum. As the
cost function is nonholonomic, it is included in task function
approach by formulating an optimization problem.
Effectiveness of the proposed methodology is demon-
strated using a set of numerical experiments. The results are
compared with the one obtained from the GJM-based visual
servoing, and it was found that the proposed approach helped
in reducing the attitude disturbance to zero. The correctness
of the simulations is backed by plotting conservation of
momentum. Finally, a set of experiments with different initial
conﬁguration and location of the features were carried out
which showed performance of the algorithm in completing
both the primary and secondary tasks successfully.
The proposed approach lends utility in reactionless visual
servoing of under water robots and earth-based robots with
ﬂexible-base. The method can also be useful in designing
a control law for mobile manipulator with lighter base for
faster operation. As the proposed method uses task func-
tion approach, it yields results when there exists degree-of-
redundancy to accommodate for secondary task or modiﬁed
image Jacobian (J
1
) looses its rank. Other limitation is
that the method does not take into account collision and
singularity avoidances which will be taken up in future. It is
also planned to validate the proposed method using an earth-
based prototype of a planar dual-arm robot mounted on an
air-bearing table.
