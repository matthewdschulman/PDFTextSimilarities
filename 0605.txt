Abstract—Sandy terrains are widely distributed on this
planet and include desert, beach, and area affected by volcanic
eruptionwherecoveredwithash.Currently,theseenvironments
still present a challenge for mobile robots due to their poor
trafﬁcability. One of the most essential requirements on such
terrains for mobile robots is to generate enough drawbar pull
with a small amount of slippage. For this purpose, protrusions
or convex patterns called lugs (i.e. grousers) are attached on
the wheels. However, oscillational drawbar pull generated by
lugs results vibration of the robot body and therefore disturb
the stability of the robot. In this paper, we aim to reduce
the oscillation of the drawbar pull by proposing a novel
wheeled mechanism integrated with an actively actuated lug.
The drawbar pull on the sandy terrain in fabricated testbed is
ﬁrstlymeasuredonaprototypemechanism.Basedonmeasured
force, a strategy of tuning sinkage length of the active lug for
generating stable drawbar pull is proposed. This method has
the advantage of that it requires neither prior knowledge on
terramechanic models nor physical properties of the terrain.
The performance of the proposed method is ﬁnally veriﬁed by
comparing the generated drawbar pull with that of a wheel
with a ﬁxed lug.
I. INTRODUCTION
Wheeled robots have played a signiﬁcant role in sandy
environments for rescue or geological investigations. In such
conditions, they easily slip or become mired in loose soil,
even to the point of mission failure. Recently, especially
with the developments of Mars/Moon exploration, signiﬁcant
efforts have been made for improving the traveling perfor-
mance of wheeled robots on challenge terrains.
Attaching lugs to the wheel surface is an effective method
for improving the traction performance of wheeled robots.
For ease of turning, special tires with spiral ﬁns were used
on Micro5 [1]. The wheels of the Apollo lunar rover were
studded with titanium chevrons to provide traction [2]. In
addition to the pattern, the height of the lugs has an obvious
inﬂuence on the driving performance of a wheel. Increasing
the lug height can increase the amplitude of drawbar pull
of the wheel, but simultaneously brings larger oscillation in
it [3]. Sutoh et al. modelled the linear traveling speed of
a wheel rover with grousers, and discussed the suitable lug
interval on a wheel to weaken the oscillation for achieving
stable linear velocity [4].
Many new mechanisms have been developed to overcome
the limitations of conventional wheels studded with ﬁxed
lugs. Chen et al. introduced the concept of movable lugs

for the driving wheel of a boat tractor [5]. Better pull
and lift forces of the lugs could be obtained from this
approach by setting the lug plates at an appropriate angle to
producethenecessaryforces.Experimentswereconductedto
observe and evaluate the lug forces acting on single movable
lug [6]. The Intelligent Vehicle Group of Jilin University
has developed a compound walking wheel having retractile
laminas that can be extend and drawn back [7]. This wheel
can passively adjust the protruded length of the laminas
to provide traction for adopting environments. With the
adjustment of the inclination angle or sinkage length of the
lug, these new types of wheels displayed the effect of lug
trajectory on soil-lug interaction forces. However, the lug
trajectories achieved by these wheels are limited owing to
the limitation of the degree of freedom of their mechanisms.
In addition to experimental investigation, many models
have been proposed to model the wheel-soil interaction
mechanics. Their principle was previously investigated by
Bekker [8] and Wong [9]. Although, existing terramechanic
models have been successfully applied to predict the wheel-
soil interaction forces for smooth wheel, they can not inher-
ently capture the ﬂuctuations caused by lugs. To solve this
problem, the discrete elements methods (DEM) have been
applied to estimate the effect of the lugs [10]. Moreover,
Iraniet al. proposed a dynamic model to capture the dynamic
oscillations observed for a wheel with lugs [11]. However,
it is still intrinsically difﬁcult to model the forces generating
by the wheel having lugs, since their motion behavior of the
wheel and lugs signiﬁcantly affect each other.
In this paper, we measure the effect of lug sinkage length
by using developed wheel with an actively actuated lug and
further highlight the advantages of planning the lug sinkage
length for improving the traction performance on a sandy
terrain. The paper is organized as follows. A novel wheel
towards accessing sandy terrain is presented in Section II.
The measurement methodology is introduced in Section III.
In Section IV, we measure the effect of lug sinkage length
with the fabricated prototype and propose a strategy to adjust
lug sinkage length for achieving stable drawbar pull. Finally,
the conclusion and plans for future studies are presented in
Section V.

The wheel, carrier, and sun gear are driven by three

via timing belts. Their angular positions are measured by
three absolute encoders (RE22, RLS, Slovenia). Most of the
components of the wheel module employed in this study
were fabricated from polyoxymethylene (POM) using a laser
cutter. This method signiﬁcantly reduces the complexity,
weight, and fabrication time and cost for prototyping. Fig. 1

soil; it is expressed by the slip ratio s, that is deﬁned as

1) Tip’s Moving Direction Angle: For a wheel rolling
forward on soft terrain at constant slip ratio s and wheel
sinkage h, the world coordinate system is established, as
shown in Fig. 3. The horizontal and vertical directions
are denoted by x

2) Lug Sinkage Length: The sinkage length determines
the contact area between the lug and the soil. Before the lug
completely sinks into the soil, its rear part is above the soil
surface (Fig. 4 (a)), and thus, the sinkage length l
s
is smaller
than protruded length l
p
. According to terramechanics, the
soil-lug reaction force is generated as a result of the cohesion
force and friction force at slip line TBCD (Fig. 4 (b)), which
starts from the lug tip till an intersection point at the soil

D. Drawbar Pull
As the wheel rolls forward on a soft terrain, the drawbar
pull is the sum of the forces acting on the wheel rim and the
lug.
The common method for modelling the drawbar pull
acting on the smooth wheel is by integrating the normal
and shear stresses acting on the contacting surface of the
wheel (Fig. 5 (a)). The normal stress and shear stress are
calculated based on the Bekker’s formula and Janosi -
Hanamoto equation, respectively [9]. Its validity was veriﬁed
by experiments in many reports.
The passive pressure theory is generally adopted to esti-
mate the effect of the lug. According to equation (11), in
addition to soil parameters (soil cohesion c, internal friction
angle ? and soil density ?), the passive stress acting on a
point belong to the lug, ?
p
, is determined by its depth z and
the surcharge q, as shown in Fig. 5 (b) [13].

It is however difﬁcult to model their resultant effect of the
wheel and the lug, since their motion behavior signiﬁcantly
affect each other. As shown in Fig. 5 (c), the wheel provides
a normal stress q acting on the soil free surface that is as
a surcharge to enhance the lug-soil interaction forces than
single lug does. On the other hand, the normal and shear
stresses acting on the wheel rim are changed by the motion
of the lug that digs and changes the soil structure beneath
the wheel. In this study, we conduct the experiments to
measure the relationship of the drawbar pull and the lug
sinkage length. Based on the measured results, we propose a
strategy to achieve stable drawbar pull by adjusting the lug
sinkage length during the wheel rotation without applying
the terramechanic models.
III. DRAWBAR PULL MEASUREMENT TESTBED
The measurements were conducted in a testbed (Fig. 6)
havingalengthof1700mm,awidthof500mmandaheight
of 800 mm. The testbed comprises both a conveyance unit
and a wheel-driving unit. The conveyance is actuated along
two slide guides at desired speed by DC brushed servo mo-
tor via ball-bearing screw. An incremental encoder (E6A2-
CWZ3E, OMRON, Japan) was used to feedback the angular
positionofthescrew.Thethreemotors(RE25integratedwith
gearbox (GP26B), Maxon Motor, Switzerland) in the wheel
module were controlled by a dsPIC33FJ128MC804-based
controller (Microchip, USA) developed in our laboratory.
The angular positions of the three joints was collected by
three absolute encoders (RE22, RLS, Slovenia). The signals
from one incremental encoder and three absolute encoders
were sampled at a rate of 200 Hz via a digital input/output
board (NI-6001, National Instrument, USA) on a PC running
a Windows XP operating system. On basis of the data from
the encoders, we can obtain the real trajectory of the lug.
The wheel module and the conveyance unit were connected
by a six-axis force/torque sensor (Mini 8/40, BL Autotec,
Japan) that measures the drawbar pull of the wheel. The
forcesignalsweresampledbyanA/Dboard(AD12-16(PCI),
Contec, Japan) at the same sample rate as used in digital data
acquisition for encoders.
The dry sand was used in the experiments, whose physical
and mechanical properties are listed in Table II.

IV. TUNING DRAWBAR PULL BY SINKAGE
LENGTH OF THE LUG
A. Lug-soil Interaction Process
Wheel slips and sinks as rolling on soft terrain. To avoid
suchslippageandsinkage,weconsidertocontrolthesinkage
length of the active lug at each angular position of the
wheel to gain additional drawbar pull. A complete lug-soil
interaction process is divided into three phases. In phase I,
thelugpenetratesthesoil;andthenitisdriventomovealong
a desired trajectory in phase II. Lastly, the lug is retracted
from the soil in phase III.
B. Effect of Lug Sinkage Length
Experiments were conducted to investigate the effect of
the lug sinkage length on the drawbar pull. We measured
the drawbar pull with lug sinkage lengths varied from 18 to
24 mm at an interval of 2 mm. In all experiments, the wheel
sinkage was 5 mm; the wheel was rotating from 0 to 180
deg at constant angular velocity of 30 deg/s; the traveling
velocity was 20 mm/s, thus the slip ratio was 0.3. In total,
10 trails were repeated in each conﬁguration.
1) Lug Trajectory: In the ﬁrst step, we summarize the
procedure to determine the trajectory of the lug in phase II.
As shown in Fig. 7, to isolate the effect of inclination angle,
? is kept as 70 deg within this phase. Because the wheel
sinkage and lug sinkage length are constant, the lug performs
a translational motion with a moving direction angle of 180
degandthusthetrajectoryoflugshaftformsahorizontalline

trajectory of the lug shaft and its workspace boundary.
The lug shaft is initially positioned at S

starts to rotate. In phase I, as the wheel rotates from 0 in
constant angular velocity, the lug is forced by the hinge to
penetrate the soil and then starts to push the soil backward.

2) Experimental Results and Discussion: The mean val-
ues of drawbar pull over 10 trails for each conﬁguration are
plotted in Fig. 8. After the contact between the lug and the
soil, the drawbar pull increased in phase I. There existed a
slightdecreaseofthedrawbarpullwhenthewheelisshifting
from the Phase I to Phase II around 22 deg. The reason is
that the velocity of the lug tip is discontinuous as the motion
of the lug switches from phase I to phase II.
After a sharp increase during the ﬁrst part of the Phase II,
the drawbar pull slowly increased to its peak value at wheel
rotational angle about 67 deg. Then, the force signiﬁcantly
dropped to a small value in rear period of phase II and
phase III. It is deduced that as the lug is bulldozing the
soil, the ground behind the lug trends to swell. However, the
wheel inhibits this swell while applying a surcharge on the
ground, thus it enhances the lug reaction forces as described
in equation (11). As the lug moves backward further, more
and more of the soil ﬂow and swell behind the wheel and
thus the effect of the wheel gradually disappears. As a result,
the reaction force will decrease in this period.
Moreover, it can be seen that the wheel with larger
sinkage length of the lug can generate larger drawbar pull.
This phenomenon is easy to be explained based on existing
terramechanic model as equation (11). Larger sinkage length
can provide larger contacting area between the lug and soil.
C. Decrease of Oscillation in Drawbar Pull
1) Strategy: According to aforementioned experimental
results, the force is not stable even though all the motion
parameters (inclination angle, lug sinkage length and tip’s
moving direction angle of the lug) were kept constant. Based
on the drawbar pull characteristics, a simple strategy to
control the lug sinkage length to achieve stable drawbar pull
is proposed in this study.
For example, if a desired drawbar pull of 3.5 N was
given, we can draw a horizontal line on the Fig. 8, the
leftmost interaction point, A (l
s
=24 mm, ?=35 deg), and the
rightmost interaction point, B (l
s
=18 mm, ?=67 deg), were
subsequently obtained. Therefore, the lug sinkage length in
phaseIIwasasfollow:thelugwasdriveninconstantsinkage
length of 24 mm as the wheel rotates from 22 deg to 35 deg;
and then the lug sinkage length linearly decreased from 24
mm to 18 mm as the wheel rotates from 35 deg to 67 deg;
Lastly, it was kept as 18 mm until the end of phase II. The
motionoftheluginphaseIandIIIwasassameasmentioned
previously (Fig. 9 (a)).
2) Experimental Results and Discussion: As shown in
Fig.10,althoughthedrawbarpullisapproximatelystabilized
about 5 N in the range of [41 deg,72 deg] of wheel rotation
angle,thevalueishoweverlargerthandesiredvalueof3.5N.
ThecurvesinFig.8andtheresultsinFig.10werederivedby
adoptingconstantandvariedlugsinkagelength,respectively.
The different behavior caused the difference between the
desired and actual values, since the wheel/lug interaction
forces are signiﬁcantly affected by accumulated deformation
of soil that forms based on previous interaction procedure.
The other example is given in trajectory ii) as shown in
Fig. 9 (b). It also can achieve stable drawbar pull within
the range [41 deg, 70 deg] of wheel rotation angle. The
stable value (about 4.2 N) is smaller than it generated in
trajectory i). Therefore, it is possible to achieve force control
by adjusting the lug sinkage length to make the wheel move
with small amount of slippage. It is noteworthy that even
though the stable range is small, using multiple controllable
lugs and making them insert into the sand one by one could
generate more wider range and more stable drawbar pull.

of the lug further, the drawbar pull generated by using wheel
with ﬁxed lug of 18 mm height (Fig. 9 (c)) is plotted in Fig.
10. Before the lug contact the ground, slight drawbar pull
was contributed by interaction of the smooth wheel and the
ground. Then, after the lug reached the soil, drawbar pull
rapidly increased to its peak value when the wheel rotated
at 70 deg. After reaching that peak value, the drawbar pull
rapidly decreased. The rapid increasing and decreasing of
the drawbar pull on such a short period leads ﬂuctuation in
the traveling velocity of the wheel, and therefore reduce the
stability of the robot. Comparing to the ﬁxed lugged wheel,
we ﬁnd that the wheel with active lug is able to insert the
lug into the soil earlier and depart from the soil later and
generate a stable drawbar pull in a wider range.
In this study, we did not apply any terramechanic model.
The strategy for controlling the lug sinkage length is based
on the measurement of the drawbar pull generated by our
developed wheel mechanism in Fig. 8. Therefore, the experi-
mentalstudyinthispaperhaspotentialtoavoidthelimitation
in existing terramechanic model and to be applied in more
kinds of soft terrains. It is also possible to adjust the drawbar
pull on-line by controlling the lug sinkage length.
V. CONCLUSIONS
Inthispaper,wehavedevelopedanewformofwheelwith
a controllable lug and proposed a strategy to adjust the lug
sinkage length to achieve stable drawbar pull. Its validity has
beenveriﬁedbyexperimentallycomparingwithconventional
wheel with ﬁxed lug. It is possible to achieve drawbar pull
control by adjusting the lug sinkage length. Moreover, the
proposed strategy did not based on any terramechanic model,
thus it is expected to be applied in a wide range of soft
terrains. In the coming studies, the effect of lug inclination
angle will be studied to enhance the traction and ﬂotation
performance of our developed wheel module.
