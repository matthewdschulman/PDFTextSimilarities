Experimental Characterization of Bowden Cable Friction
Dongyang Chen, Youngmok Yun and Ashish D. Deshpande
Abstract— This paper presents a systematic method for
experimental characterization of Bowden cable friction. A novel
tension measurement method using a motion capture system
and a spring is introduced. With the tension measurement
method, the effects of nine variables on friction are investigated.
Experimental results show that i) a combination of 7x19 FEP-
coated stainless steel cable and double-sheaths has the highest
force transmission efﬁciency; ii) smaller coefﬁcient of friction
material, smaller cable moving speed, shorter cable length,
longer clamp distance, stiffer cable/sheath all help to increase
the force transmission efﬁciency; and iii) the static friction
pretension ratio only decreases as the coefﬁcient of friction of
cable/sheath decreases or as cable/sheath stiffness increases. We
have generated guidelines for the Bowden cable performance
which may help robotics researchers in choosing materials for
the Bowden cables and designing control systems for actuation.
I. INTRODUCTION
A Bowden cable is a type of ﬂexible cable used to
transmit mechanical force or energy by the movement of
an inner cable relative to a hollow outer sheath. It has been
widely used in complex and space-constrained environments,
typically in car and bike brake systems. Recently, many
robotic researchers, particularly those who design wearable
robots and medical devices, have introduced Bowden cables
into robot applications [1–6]. We also plan to use Bowden
cable actuation in a novel hand exoskeleton [7].
Bowden cables have several advantages which make them
attractive for robot applications. The ﬁrst one is remote
actuation. Many robot systems suffer from the mass/moment
of inertia of actuators and transmission systems because
they change the dynamic properties of the system. The
mass/moment of inertia especially degrade the transparency
of wearable robots. By using a Bowden cable, the actuators
can be placed away from the end-effectors, which helps to
reduce the weight and increase the power density. The second
advantage is ﬂexibility. Most of mechanical transmission
systems such as gear trains, torsion bars and levers are
rigid, which restricts the conﬁguration and range of motion
of the system. Since a Bowden cable is only clamped at
the ends, it is a essentially a routing-free solution which
makes it ﬂexible. Third, the routing path of a Bowden cable
can be freely changed without reaction forces while other

transmission systems need reaction forces to change the path
of transmission. For example, a cable driven system needs
reaction forces from pulleys to change its routing path, which
affects robot dynamics. And the location where reaction
force is exerted on robot systems can be changed by using
Bowden cables. In theory, Bowden cables can isolate load
actuators without reaction forces, as will be described in later
section.
However, a critical weakness of a Bowden cable is the high
friction, which is generated between the inner cable and outer
sheath and degrades the performance of the transmission sys-
tem. [8] report that their robot consumes 90% of the energy
to overcome the friction. Despite the signiﬁcant inﬂuence
of the friction, most robot researchers have regarded it as a
disturbance in their control scheme [2][9][10] because it is
hard to compensate for it due to its non-linearity and multi-
variable dependency.
There have been a limited number of studies on Bowden
cable friction. Lawrence et al. [11] used a simple model to
express the force relationships at both extremities of a Bow-
den cable, which only considered the coefﬁcient of friction
and wrapping angle as inﬂuencing factors. Goiriena et al.
[12] only partially showed the inﬂuence of some variables
on friction using only steel cables and one sheath. There
is no systematic method for characterizing the performance
of Bowden cables, leading to difﬁculty in the selection of
proper Bowden cables and in designing control systems for
Bowden cable actuated robots.
This paper presents a systematic experimental method
for the characterization of friction for small-sized Bowden
cable systems. Since friction depends on many variables
including material properties, length, conﬁguration etc, we
choose not to develop a theoretical model. The paper ﬁrst
introduces a friction measurement method with a novel ten-
sion measurement technique using a motion capture system
and springs. Second, the best combination of inner cable and
outer sheath is determined after exploring ﬁfteen different
candidates through comprehensive experiments. Finally the
inﬂuence of a number of variables including cable speed,
pretension, cable length, clamp distance and clamp orienta-
tion on friction is investigated.
Our study may help robotics researchers in design of
hardware and controller. The selection of actuator size is
an important design decision and the estimation of external
disturbance inﬂuences controls greatly. We provide guide-
lines for the selection of Bowden cable conﬁgurations, and
the range of friction for the given condition based on the
experimental analysis.

II. EXPERIMENT DESIGN
A. Theoretical Background
So far the only theoretical model for describing Bowden
cable friction is the Capstan formula [11, 12] as follows:
T

=T
2
e

(1)
where  is the kinetic coefﬁcient of friction between the
cable and sheath,  is the total wrapping angle, T
1
is the
input force and T
2
is the output force (Fig. 1). Numerous
factors affect the performance of a Bowden cable, but this
model only considers two factors and. Hence it is limited
in describing the actual behaviour. Given the complexity of
friction behaviour, we propose to characterize Bowden cable
friction through experiments.
The buckling effect of Bowden cables is also an important
factor for studying friction. Fig. 2 shows a typical bike brake
system. For situation (a), it only uses a cable, and thus
the whole structure tends to move to the right when the
external force is applied on the cable because there is no
reaction force to counteract the external force. However when
a Bowden cable is used as in situation (b), since the sheath
is clamped at both ends, it will apply a reaction force to the
structure and make it isolated. This is one of the advantages
of Bowden cables as mentioned in Introduction. However
this brings forth the buckling problem, which causes the
deformation of the sheath and makes the other inﬂuencing
factors, especially the wrapping angle, indeterministic. To
account for such effects, we include the stiffness of cables
and sheaths as variables for our experiments.
B. Experiment Methodology
1) Variables selection and experiment procedure: The
friction of a Bowden cable is determined by measuring the
difference in tension before and after the Bowden cable.
Instead of using a force sensor, we propose a novel tension
measurement method using a motion capture system and
springs. This new method is described and evaluated in
Section III.
(a) Use only cable (b) Use Bowden cable
Fig. 2: Illustration of a Bowden cable used in a brake system.
By using a Bowden cable, the reaction force generated by
the sheath counteracts the external force and helps to isolate
the system.
Among the possible factors inﬂuencing static and kinetic
friction, we chose and investigated nine variables for our
experiment: stiffness of cable and sheath, material of cable
and sheath, cable length, clamp orientation, clamp distance,
pretension and cable speed. To reduce the number of un-
necessary experiments, we divided the experiments into two
steps. First we determined the optimal combination of cable
and sheath, which will be shown in Section IV . Then in
Section V , we investigated the inﬂuences of other variables
on friction by experimenting with the best combinations of
cable and sheath as determined in the previous step.
2) Evaluation Criteria: In this paper, we use force trans-
mission efﬁciency deﬁned by (2) and static friction preten-
sion ratio deﬁned by (3) as the criteria to compare exper-
imental results of different cases. The force transmission
efﬁciency is equal to the quotient of the tension in the cable
after the sheath,T
2
divided by that before the sheath,T
1
. And
the static friction pretension ratio is equal to the quotient of
the maximum static friction, f
SM
divided by the pretension
in the cable after the sheath, T
0
2
. The force transmission
efﬁciency reﬂects kinetic friction, while the static friction
pretension ratio reﬂects static friction. High force transmis-
sion efﬁciency and low static friction pretension ratio is
desired in a Bowden cable system.

Except for the stiffness and material type of cable and sheath,
all the other variables have little effect on static friction
pretension ratio. Therefore, only in the stiffness and material
sections of Section IV , the effects on static friction pretension
ratio will be discussed. And the maximum static friction is
used to evaluate the effect of pretension because it is the
only factor inﬂuenced by pretension.
III. CALIBRATION AND VERIFICATION OF FORCE
MEASUREMENT SYSTEM
The usual way to measure force or tension is to use a
load cell or force gauge. However the main drawback of a
force sensor is that its weight is usually not negligible for
the original system. The inclusion of the mass may change
5928
the dynamic characteristics of the system and in turn affect
the force measurement accuracy.
We introduce a new way of force measurement using a
motion capture system (PhaseSpace Inc.) with springs. The
idea is to attach markers to both ends of a spring, and
insert the spring at any point where force is to be measured
as shown in Fig. 3(a). Eight cameras are hung around the
markers to capture the 3D motion of each marker. The
deﬂection of the spring is recorded by the motion capture
system, and the force is calculated using spring constant.

the novel measurement method. (b) The force measurement
system is calibrated using a set of weights. The ﬁtted line has
a correlation coefﬁcient of 0.9998 which shows the spring
calibrated has linear behaviour. (c) The force measured by
the new method and the force gauge are compared, the
average error between the two sets of data is 0.01 N.
Since the mass of a spring is usually small, it has little effect
on the dynamics of the original system.
To validate the performance of the novel tension mea-
surement system, we ﬁrst calibrated the spring and the
experimental results show that the chosen spring has linear
behaviour (Fig. 3(b)). Then we connected a motor, a string
with the calibrated spring in series with a force gauge
(Fig. 3(a)). We applied a sinusoidal force with a motor and
measured it with both methods. The sampling rate of the
force gauge is at 1000 Hz, while the new measurement
system runs at 480 Hz. Results show that the novel force
measurement method is accurate in a dynamic setting. The
two curves in Fig. 3(c) are almost the same except for some
data noises and the average error between the data from these
two methods is around 0.01 N.
IV. DETERMINATION OF THE BEST COMBINATION OF
CABLE AND SHEATH
A. Experiment Methodology
There are many possibilities for cables and sheaths and
selecting the right type of cable and sheath is crucial for all
Bowden cable applications. Cables and sheaths can both be
speciﬁed in terms of three major factors, namely stiffness,
material and diameter. Generally the diameter of cables and
sheaths is restricted by the application requirement such as
load or size. Therefore, we focus on studying the inﬂuence of
stiffness and material of cables and sheaths. For consistency,
all the different types of cables we used have the same outer
diameter of 0.635 mm, while all the sheaths have the same
inner diameter of 1.016 mm.
According to the factors mentioned above, we used
three types of sheaths for our experiment, Nylon sheath,
PTFE (Polytetraﬂuoroethene) sheath and double-sheaths.
The double-sheaths is made by inserting a PTFE sheath
into an MFA (modiﬁed ﬂuoroalkoxy) sheath and it becomes
stiffer than a single PTFE sheath, while its inner material
remains the same. Therefore, by comparing the experimental
results of Nylon and PTFE sheaths, the effect of sheath
material can be understood and by comparing the results
of PTFE and double-sheaths, we can determine the effect of
sheath stiffness.
We used ﬁve types of cables for our experiment, 1x7,
7x3 and 7x19 stainless steel cables, 7x19 Nylon-coated and
7x19 FEP (Fluorinated ethylene propylene)-coated cables.
The stiffness of a cable is determined by the number of its
strands and wires per strand (Fig. 4), which is indicated by
their name (For example, a 7x19 cable consists of seven
strand, each made with nineteen wires). And for the cables
we used, 1x7 cables are the most stiff ones, while 7x19
cables are the most compliant ones, and the stiffness of
7x3 cables falls in between. Therefore, by comparing the
experimental results of 1x7, 7x3 and 7x19 stainless cables,
the effect of cable stiffness can be seen and by comparing
the results of 7x19 stainless steel, 7x19 Nylon-coated and
7x19 FEP-coated cables, we can determine the the effect of
cable materials.

example an 1x7 cable consists of one strand, each made with
seven wires. The construction mainly determines the stiffness
of a cable. 1x7 cables have the largest stiffness, 7x19 cables
have the smallest stiffness, and the stiffness of 7x3 cables
falls in between.

TABLE I: Variables selected for the experiments. There are
nine variables in total, including the stiffness of cable and
sheath, material of cable and sheath, pretension, cable speed
and geometrical factors such as cable length, clamp distance
and clamp orientation. The different values used for each
variable are shown in the table.

In summary, we study three kinds of sheaths and ﬁve
kinds of cables in all. Fig. 5 and Table I show all the cables
and sheaths used in our experiments. Based on the number
of types of cables and sheaths, there are ﬁfteen different
combinations in total. For all combinations, three different
speeds and three different pretensions are tested. All the
geometrical variables are controlled and maintained the same

different speeds but starts from the same initial position so
that we can check the effect of cable speed on friction, then
it runs at a constant speed but with three different initial
positions so that the effect of pretension on friction can
be checked. And under every situation, the experiment is
conducted for three times and the results are averaged.
After the experiments, the tensions in the cables are
calculated, and the output force T
2
is plotted versus the
input force T
1
. Fig. 7 shows a representative plot for one
experiment. The curve can be divided into 6 segments and
their meaning is:
1) A-B: This segment corresponds to the initial stationery
phase of one cycle. The coordinates of point A reﬂect the
pretension in the cables before and after the sheath. From
point A to B, T
1
increases but T
2
remains the same, which
means the cable has not started moving yet and point B is
the moment when the maximum static friction is reached,
thus the static friction pretension ratio is calculated at this
point.
2) B-C: This segment corresponds to the forward static-
to-kinetic transition phase. The difference between T
1
and
T
2
becomes larger than the maximum static friction, and
the cable starts moving. Because it takes some time for the
cable to reach the predetermined constant speed from zero,
the transition segment has some curvature.
3) C-D: This segment corresponds to the forward stable
phase. The slope of this segment is the forward force
transmission efﬁciency.
4) D-E: This segment corresponds to the forward kinetic-
to-static transition phase. Because the motor stops much
faster than the cable, the cable is still moving forward with
a decreasing speed and T
2
increases while T
1
decreases till
the cable stops moving.
5) E-H: These segments are the same phases as the ones
stated before, the only difference is the direction of friction
is changed.

The slope of the forward stable segment, which corresponds
to the force transmission efﬁciency, decreases as the cable
speed increases. (b) The slope of the forward stable phase
remains the same as pretension varies. Therefore the force
transmission efﬁciency is not affected by pretension.
B. Results and Discussion
1) Cable speed: The larger the cable speed is, the less the
force transmission efﬁciency is. Fig. 8(a) shows the effects of
various cable speeds. As can be seen, the slope of the forward
stable segment, which is the force transmission efﬁciency,
decreases as speed increases. Same conclusions can be drawn
by looking at Table II, for all different combinations of cables
and sheaths, the efﬁciency decreases as speed increases. One
reason for this is that Bowden cable friction includes some
viscous friction. Another reason is that the coefﬁcients of
friction of the materials may increase with velocity.
2) Pretension: The larger the pretension is, the larger
the maximum static friction is, but the force transmission
efﬁciency remains the same. As can be seen in Fig. 8(b), the
slopes of the forward stable segments are the same for all
three pretensions, i.e. the efﬁciency is the same. This can be
further observed by looking at Table II, where the efﬁciency
values are very close to each other for the three different
pretensions in all cases.
On the other hand, according to Fig. 8(b) and Table III,
the increase in the pretension leads to the increase of the
maximum static friction. The reason for this is that the
increased pretension results in larger normal forces between
the cable and sheath, and thus the maximum static friction
TABLE II: Force transmission efﬁciencies for the experi-
ments to determine the best combination of cable and sheath.
For the same kinds of sheath, stiffer cables and those with
smaller coefﬁcient of friction have larger force transmission
efﬁciency. For the same kinds of cables, stiffer sheath and
those with smaller coefﬁcient of friction have larger force
transmission efﬁciency. The efﬁciency decreases as cable
speed increases, and it does not change as pretension varies.

increases. Note that we can not compare the values of
the maximum static friction among different combinations
because their pretensions are not controlled to be same.
3) Sheath and cable stiffness: The larger the sheath
stiffness is, the larger the force transmission efﬁciency is.
As can be seen in Table II, when paired with all kinds
of cables, double-sheaths always has higher efﬁciency than
the single PTFE sheath. For 7x3 and 7x19 stainless steel
cables, the efﬁciency is increased by 10 percent when using
a double-sheath instead of a single sheath. This is because
under the same compressive force, a stiffer sheath has
smaller deformation and wrapping angle than a compliant
sheath, which results in higher efﬁciency according to the
Capstan formula (1) and the experimental results of clamp
orientation (Table VI(a)) shown in Section V . Cable stiffness
has the same effect on force transmission efﬁciency as sheath
stiffness does. As shown in Table II, 1x7 cable has the best
performance among all stainless steel cables in all situations.
As regard to the static friction pretension ratio (Table
IV), the increase of cable stiffness helps to lower the ratio
and improves the Bowden cable performance. However, by
comparing the results of PTFE sheath and double-sheaths, it
can be seen that there is only small change in the ratio as
sheath stiffness varies.
4) Sheath and cable material: The smaller the coefﬁcient
of friction between the sheath and cable is, the larger
the force transmission efﬁciency and the smaller the static
friction pretension ratio is. As shown in Table V, in terms
of sheath material, PTFE has smaller coefﬁcients of friction
than Nylon for all cases. And for cable materials, FEP has
the smallest coefﬁcient of friction. This is consistent with our
experimental results (Table II), i.e. PTFE sheath has larger
efﬁciency than Nylon ones and FEP-coated cables have the
largest efﬁciency.
There is one case where the coefﬁcient of friction shows
different results than the experiment results. When paired
with PTFE sheath, Nylon cables are supposed to have larger
coefﬁcient of friction than stainless steel ones, however in
Table II, 7x19 Nylon cables have larger efﬁciency than 7x19
stainless steel cables. The possible reason for this is that the
coefﬁcient of friction given in Table V is under the premise
that the surface of both materials is smooth. However since
the stainless steel cable is braided with multiple strands, the
surface of the cable is relatively rough, which results in less
efﬁciency.
Our results show that, overall the best combination from
force transmission efﬁciency and static friction pretension
ratio standpoints is 7x19 FEP-coated cable and double-
sheaths.
V. INVESTIGATION OF EFFECTS OF GEOMETRICAL
VARIABLES
A. Experiment Methodology
Here we study the effects of geometrical variables, as
shown in Fig. 6, where l is the cable length,  is the clamp
orientation and d is the clamp distance. For the sake of
space, we present results from experiments with only the best
combination of cable and sheath: 7x19 FEP-coated cables
and double-sheaths.
To determine the effects of clamp orientation, we ran the
experiments at three different orientations (45

, 90

, 180

)
with the following conditions: 400 mm cable length, 400
mm clamp distance, 0:046 m/s cable speed. To determine

Other factors except for cable and sheath, do not have
signiﬁcant effect on static friction pretension ratio. The ratio
decreases as the stiffness of cable and sheath increases and
smaller coefﬁcient of friction also helps to reduce the ratio,
which means better performance.

B. Results and Discussion
1) Clamp orientation: The larger the clamp orientation
angle is, the lower the force transmission efﬁciency is. As
shown in Table VI, as increases, the efﬁciency drops from
about 80 percent to 67 percent. This is consistent with the
Capstan model, because the total wrapping angle of the cable
around the sheath increases as  increases.
2) Clamp distance and cable length: The longer the cable
and the shorter the clamp distance is, the lower the force
transmission efﬁciency is. For the same clamp distance, the
efﬁciency drops as cable length increases (Table VI). And
for the same cable length, the efﬁciency drops as clamp
distance decreases (Table VI). This is because when the
clamp distance decreases or the cable length increases, larger
and larger part of the cable will lose the constraint from the
clamps which leads to the increase in wrapping angle and
even buckling.
VI. LIMITATION AND CONCLUSION
One limitation of the study is that there may be potential
correlations among the nine factors which was not inves-
tigated. Another limitation is that Bowden cables are not
only used for force transmission but for motion transmission
in some cases as well. The elongation and deformation
of Bowden cables should be considered when controlling
positions. These limitations are part of future work. Finally,
this paper only studies the characteristics of small Bowden
cables. While they are smaller than bike cables, they are
often used in robotic applications. The experimental results
show that the characteristics of small Bowden cables may
hold for larger ones as well.
We present a systematic experimental method for the char-
acterization of Bowden cable friction. We have introduced a
novel force measurement method based on a motion capture
system and a spring and have validated its performance.
Through the comprehensive experiments results, the best
combination of cable and sheath having the highest force
transmission efﬁciency is determined, which is: 7x19 FEP-
coated cable and double-sheaths. We have investigated the
effects of nine variables, including material and stiffness of
cables and sheaths, cable speed, pretension, clamp distance,
clamp orientation and cable length on the force transmis-
sion efﬁciency and static friction pretension ratio. We have
generated guidelines for the Bowden cable performance,
and depending on the need of their applications, robotics
researchers could beneﬁt from these results when choosing
Bowden cables and designing control systems.
