Study of Limit Cycle in Antagonistically Coupled Magneto-Rheological
Actuators
Peyman Yadmellat and Mehrdad R. Kermani
Abstract— In this paper, the presence of limit cycles in the
behavior of antagonistically coupled Magneto-Rheological (MR)
actuators is investigated. The actuator considered in this paper
was developed and described in [1] and [2]. This actuator offers
high torque-to-mass and torque-to-inertia ratios, for inherent
safe actuation. While the antagonistic arrangement is beneﬁcial
in improving the actuator performance and eliminating back-
lash, it may result in limit cycles when the actuator operates in
a position control loop. The occurrence of limit cycle depends
on the parameters of the actuator as well as the controller.
An in-depth analysis is carried out in this paper to establish a
connection between the system parameters and the limit cycle
occurrence. Moreover, sufﬁcient conditions for avoiding limit
cycle are derived speciﬁcally for a Proportional-Derivative (PD)
controller. Simulations and experimental results validate the
analysis and provide insights into the limit cycle observed in
the operation of antagonistic MR actuators.
I. INTRODUCTION
Limit cycles are self-excited oscillations in nonlinear sys-
tems, the characteristics of which are irrespective to initial
conditions. Such a periodic solution emerges as a closed
trajectory in the phase portrait of a nonlinear system. In par-
ticular, the limit cycle oscillation is an undesirable response
to positioning control systems that can cause mechanical
failure. As experimentally observed, antagonistic actuation
based on Magneto-Rheological (MR) ﬂuids can give rise to
limit cycles in position control loops. This paper aims at
establishing the dependency of limit cycle occurrence on the
parameters of MR actuators.
MR ﬂuids are non-homogenous suspensions of
micrometer-sized ferromagnetic particles in a carrier
ﬂuid. The apparent viscosity of MR ﬂuids can be adjusted
by an external magnetic ﬁeld. The suspended particles in
the ﬂuid form columns (chains) aligned to the direction of
the applied ﬁeld that results in shearing or ﬂow resistance
in the ﬂuid. The degree of the resistive force is related
to the strength of the magnetic ﬁeld, resulting in a ﬁeld
dependent yield stress in MR ﬂuids [3], [4]. In the absence
of a magnetic ﬁeld, MR ﬂuids act as Newtonian ﬂuids
whose viscosity change proportional to the shear rate.
Controllability and fast response of MR ﬂuids to external
magnetic ﬁeld have made them an attractive technology
for a broad range of applications from civil engineering
to automotive, robotics, and rehabilitation applications (e.g.

see [5]–[7]). Particularly, in robotics, MR actuators can be
employed in series with active drives (e.g. motors) to control
the delivery of the output torque at the joints. Beneﬁts
of a controllable actuator utilizing MR ﬂuids have been
recognized in various robotic applications including haptic
devices [8]–[10] and human-robot interaction [2], [11]–[13].
As the main contribution of this paper, a careful and
in-depth analysis of the occurrence of limit cycles in the
operation of an antagonistic MR actuator is performed. To
this end, the dynamic model of the antagonistic actuator is
formulated. Considering the system in a feedback loop, a
set of simulations is carried out to provide insights to the
occurrence of the limit cycle in the actuator response. The
describing function method [14, Ch. 7] is then employed to
predict the possibility of limit cycle oscillation in the actuator
response. The frequency and amplitude of the oscillations are
analytically derived and their dependencies on the system pa-
rameters and PD controller are studied. Sufﬁcient conditions
under which limit cycle oscillations can be prevented are
obtained. The results are experimentally validated using a
planar robot utilizing MR actuators as a test bench.
The rest of this paper is organized as follow: Section II
introduces antagonist actuators based on MR ﬂuids along
with discussion on MR ﬂuids characteristics. A nonlinear
model of an antagonistic MR actuator is also derived in this
section. Section III presents the main contribution of this
paper, where the occurrence of limit cycles is analyzed, and
the amplitude and frequency of the resultant limit cycle is
obtained. In Section IV, simulation and experimental results
are provided to validate our theoretical analysis. Finally,
Section V concludes the paper.
II. MAGNETO-RHEOLOGICAL FLUID-BASED ACTUATION
The torque-velocity behavior of an MR actuator is formu-
lated in this section. Fig. 1 depicts the Distributed Active-
Semi Active (DASA) actuation concept. In this arrangement,
the active drive provides power to the joint, via an MR
clutch that controls the output torque. A drawback of DASA
actuation is the need for the motor velocity to revers for
bi-directional actuation, resulting in backlash in geared ac-
tuation. Moreover, the performance of the actuation will be
limited by the performance of the active drive. To address
the problem, the DASA actuation can be extended to an
antagonistic conﬁguration [2].
Antagonistic actuation provides bi-directional actuation by
utilizing a single unidirectional motor (see Fig. 2). In this
conﬁguration, two MR clutches receive rotational motion in
opposite direction from a motor that provides a unidirectional

gearing. In this way, the net torque delivered to the joint
in both direction can be changed without altering the motor
direction. While eliminating backlash in the gears and/or
transmission belts. This is due to the fact that neither gears
nor the transmission belts lose their engagements with the
motor.
In general, the behavior of MR actuators depends on the
MR ﬂuid characteristics and the geometry of the actuator.
The effects of the MR ﬂuids and geometrical parameters
of the actuator on the operation of A-DASA actuation are

A. Models for MR Fluids
Fig. 3 shows the shear stress-shear rate behavior of a
sample MR ﬂuid, which qualitatively represents the typical
behavior of MR ﬂuids [15]. As observed, the behavior of
an MR ﬂuid can be divided into two main phases; pre-
yielding and post-yielding regions. The behavior of MR
ﬂuids varies from viscoelastic in the pre-yielding region to
plastic in the post-yielding, and it is visco-plastic in the
transition through yielding. This type of behavior suggests a
biviscous characteristic (see Fig. 4), where the ﬂuid behavior

B. A-DASA Model
Fig. 5 shows the cross–section of a typical multi–disk MR
clutch. The input shaft breaks out into a set of input disks
which are aligned in parallel to a set of output disks attached
to the output shaft. MR ﬂuid ﬁlls the volume between input
and output disks. By energizing the electromagnetic coil, the
shear stress of MR ﬂuids, thereby the output torque of the
clutch can be controlled. Considering this arrangement, the
shear rate of MR ﬂuids at radius  equals to

where



where  is the shear stress as deﬁned in (1). Assuming
that the clutches in antagonistic conﬁguration are identical,
and each clutch has N output disks, the torque transmitted
through either of the clutches can be obtained after substi-
tuting (1) into (4) and integrating across both faces of each
output disk. After some algebraic manipulations, one can

actuator forj


ri



, when the output torque of the actuator
decreases in absolute value, depending on the value of }

.
In a typical MR actuator, this phenomenon results in zero
acceleration at velocities closed to the motor velocity, as such
the output shaft velocity
_

l
remains in a bounded region, i.e.
j
_

l
j
_

m
.
In general, the output torque of the actuator can be
controlled by adjusting the applied magnetic ﬁelds to the
clutches and varying the motor velocity. It is however
favourable to set the motor velocity to a constant value
greater than the maximum desired velocity and control the
torque solely by the applied magnetic ﬁelds, i.e.H
1
andH
2
.
III. LIMIT CYCLE ANALYSIS

loop is studied in this section. This study requires a dynamic
model of the controlled system. Fig. 7 shows a position
control scheme for the A-DASA actuation, in which G

the output shaft mechanical subsystem, respectively. The

A. Assumptions and Preliminaries
In order to use describing function method, the system is
required to be presented as an interconnection of linear sub-
systems and a nonlinearity. Referring to Fig. 7, the dynamic
model of the A-DASA subsystem is required. Deﬁning the
post-yielding torque T

Given the fact that the effect of the ﬂuid viscosity is
neglectable
1
, the output torque of the A-DASA actuator is
approximately equal toT
y
when the actuator operates in the
post-yielding region. In the event that the actuator enters
the pre-yielding region, the output torque will decrease in
absolute value reciprocal to the growth of the output shaft
velocity due to roll-off (see (5)). The position control block

The describing function method can now be used to
analysis the possibility of limit cycles. In this method, the
system is assumed to be a free system; that is, the system is
only excited by the initial conditions and the system inputs
are zero. The basic idea behind the analysis is to derive
conditions under which the system is capable of regenerating
a sinusoid, if the input to the nonlinearity is sinusoidal. This
condition is met when the closed-loop gain of the system
from the nonlinearity input back to the nonlinearity equals
to unity. Hence, the system exhibits limit cycle behavior,
regenerating the same sinusoidal response.

A limit cycle is predicted for any non-zero positive A that
satisﬁes the equality given in (27). This is equivalent to the
transfer function of the closed-loop system to be unity for
the speciﬁed A and !. Consequently, an oscillation will be
regenerated in the loop, resulting in a limit cycle behavior.

Therefore, at least one of the system time constants should
be designed to be as small as possible in order to increase
the allowable bound for k

depends on the
output shaft inertia and the inertia of the robot link attached
to the actuator. Decreasing

corresponds to reducing the
robot link inertia, which may not be feasible. It is therefore
required to minimize

. In conclusion, high bandwidth magnetic
circuit is essential if the goal is to avoid the occurrence of
limit cycles and attain high performance.
IV. EXPERIMENTAL VALIDATIONS AND SIMULATION
In this section, a set of model-based simulations along with
experimental results are provided to validate our analysis.
The experimental results were carried out using a 2-DOF
manipulator. The 2-DOF manipulator (see Fig. 9) utilizes
MR clutches as part of its actuation system. Two MR
clutches conﬁgured antagonistically are used to actuate the
ﬁrst joint, while the second joint is actuated using a single
MR clutch and a spring (for more details on the design of
the manipulator see [12]). The antagonistic joint was only
used in this set of experiments. The speciﬁcations of the
MR clutches used in this manipulator were given in Table
I. The robot link inertia is 0:13 kg.m
2
. The manipulator is
driven by a brushless motor (BLWRPG235D-36V-4000-R13)
to provide the rotational inputs to the MR clutches. The
motor is driven by a driver in the velocity control mode.
The manipulator incorporates two encoders (HEDS-9000)
to measure the angular positions of the joints. Three high-
power motor drivers (AMC-AZ12A8), set in current mode,
provide the command currents to the MR clutches. In our
experiments, both controllers were implemented on a desktop
computer connected to the manipulator via a dSPACE (DS
1103) controller board. The sampling frequency for gathering
experimental data was set to 1 kHz.
A. Model-based Simulations
The A-DASA actuation in Fig.7 for position control was
considered. The output torque of the actuator was modeled
by (5) and (7). The response of the system was simulated
by solving the ordinary differential equation (8) in Matlab,

T
depends on the magnetic ﬁeld time constant. The magnetic ﬁeld
time constant is a function of the coil inductance and the reluctance of
the magnetic circuit forming magnetic ﬂux. Both parameters depend on the
internal dimensions of the actuator, and can be optimised in the actuator
design stage.

B. Preliminary Experiments
The occurrence of limit cycle was investigated using the
2-DOF robot. Fig. 13 shows the experimental results for
two different proportional gains. The proportional gains were
k
p
= 1 and k
p
= 2, respectively. To perturb the robot from

its steady state, a 100 mA current was applied att = 2s and
removed at t = 4s. As seen, the frequency of the response
changes with respect to the controller gain. Referring to
(24), it can be shown that the limit cycle frequency for a
P controller (for k
d
= 0) can be approximated by,

According to (30), the frequency of the limit cycle is
expected to grow proportionally with the root square of k

The limit cycle frequencies for k

f = 1:9048 Hz and f = 2:4876 Hz, respectively. The limit
cycle frequency for k

V. CONCLUSION
In this paper, the occurrence of limit cycles in the behavior
of an antagonistically coupled MR actuators was discussed.
A practical example was studied to demonstrate the pos-
sibility of limit cycle induced by the antagonistic arrange-
ment of the actuators when operated in the position control

loop. Using describing function method, the dependency of
the limit cycle on the actuator parameters was thoroughly
analyzed, and the results were demonstrated. Further, the
frequency and amplitude of the resultant limit cycle were
analytically derived as functions of the system parameters. It
was shown that the limit cycle oscillations could be prevented
for speciﬁc PD controller gains. As an important observation,
it was discussed that high-bandwidth magnetic circuits were
essential in eliminating the limit cycle. Numerical simula-
tions along with experimental results validated the theoretical
analysis. The insight gained in this paper can be used as a
foundation for the design of antagonistically coupled MR
actuators as well as the design of controllers aiming at the
limit cycle prevention.
