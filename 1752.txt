Abstract— This paper presents the performance of a newly
developed adhesive that combines an electrostatic adhesive
with a directional dry (gecko-like) adhesive. The focus is on
the adhesive’s performance on micro-rough surfaces, which
has a large number of applications in robotic mobility and
manipulation such as climbing, perching, and grasping. Perfor-
mance was characterized using shear/normal adhesion pressure
limit curves and comparing the new hybrid adhesive to each
individual adhesive mechanism and a control. Results show that
the electrostatic directional dry adhesive generally performs
better than a directional dry adhesive, but that on several
surfaces, an electrostatic adhesive with no ﬁbrillar mechanism
performs the best. Additionally, the paper introduces a new
mechanism that maintains an adhesive’s compliance on micro-
rough surfaces while transmitting shear and normal forces to
a rigid structure. The mechanism is experimentally compared
to a rigid backing and a gecko-like hierarchical suspension
layer. Results show that the mechanism performs the best when
subjected to mainly normal loads, but a hierarchical suspension
handles shear loads better.
I. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND
Research in attachment mechanisms for robotic grippers
covers a wide range of technologies. To date, most perform
well only on substrates with particular material or surface
properties. For many mechanisms, such as suction [1] and
gecko-like ﬁbrillar adhesives [2], [3], this equates to very
smooth surfaces (e.g glass, silicon wafers). On rough sur-
faces, technologies such as microspines [4] perform well.
Little work to date has been done on adhering to micro-
rough surfaces (e.g. painted drywall, unﬁnished wood).
In this paper, we present the experimental results of
a new adhesive designed for a wide spectrum of real-
world materials with varied roughness and material com-
position. Speciﬁcally, we examine a newly reported hybrid
electrostatic/directional-dry adhesive (EDA, [5], see Fig. 1)
that can adhere to surfaces that contain bumps, crevices, and
micro-scale roughness. The paper also introduces a novel
interface between the adhesive and a robot that allows EDAs

to withstand both shear and normal loads, whereas previously
reported results on EDAs dealt with shear loads only. The
paper compares the shear/normal force limit curves of EDAs
coupled with the newly described mechanism with both rigid
[6] and gecko-inspired hierarchical suspension systems [7].
EDAs generate adhesion in two ways. First, they are made
of a thin layer of soft, Shore 40A silicone that conforms to
the substrate to create a large real area of contact with the
micro-scale ﬁbers. This helps generate large van der Waals
forces. Second, the electrostatic adhesion generates a normal
adhesive force [8]. Since the EDA is compliant, the normal
force engages more of the EDA with the substrate, thus
creating a positive feedback cycle.
On smooth surfaces, creating a large real area of con-
tact is relatively simple. However, on rough surfaces, the
adhesives need compliance. To achieve this, we previously
developed a thin, highly compliant adhesive [5], [9] and
demonstrated that it had comparatively high shear adhesion
pressures. However, no work has been done on identifying
the full shear/normal force limit curves of these adhesives.
Ultimately, to effectively utilize the adhesive on a robotic
platform it must have the ability to withstand normal forces.
This is particularly important for applications such as robotic
grappling, object manipulation, and unmanned aerial vehicle
(UA V) perching. Thus, there is a disconnect between the
soft, compliant structure needed to allow for a large real area
of contact on a rough surface and the more rigid mounting
structure needed to interface to a robot body.
One of the major issues with normal adhesion is evenly
distributing the load across the entire surface. If the load
is not evenly distributed, then a small area will fail and

crack propagation will occur. Gecko-like ﬁbrillar adhesives
are designed to mitigate crack propagation [10], but so far
there is a practical limit to their ability.
Evenly distributing a normal load across the adhesive
when attached to non-contoured glass, or a similarly smooth
surface, is relatively easy with a rigid backing [6]. However,
as mentioned above, when the adhesives are used on a non-
smooth surface, a rigid plate prevents the adhesive from
creating a large real area of contact. To address this, previous
researchers have taken inspiration from a gecko’s hierarchical
toe structure [11] and created a connecting layer between the
adhesive and the robot that consists of directional ﬁbrillar
stalks (see Fig. 7) [7], [12]. The hierarchical structure has
shown to work well when loaded in shear, but has limitations
with increasing normal loads.
To address some of the issues with either the rigid or
hierarchical backing layers, we developed a novel ﬂuidized
“pouch” that can both conform to a surface and evenly
distribute normal loads. A cross-sectional view of the concept
is shown in Fig. 2. Essentially, the system uses a piston to
apply a normal load to a cavity ﬁlled with an incompressible
ﬂuid that evenly distributes the force across the adhesive.
Coupled with this ﬂuidized pouch is a mechanism, described
later, that can distribute shear loads.
This paper presents experimental data comparing
shear/normal force limit curves for these backing
mechanisms on both smooth and micro-rough surfaces.
We do this for four different types of adhesives: EDAs,
electrostatic adhesives, directional dry adhesives, and
reinforced silicone elastomer polydimethylsiloxane
(PDMS). The paper ﬁrst describes the experimental
setup including fabrication methods of each backing and
adhesive technology. We then present the test results along
with a discussion of the results.
II. FABRICATION AND EXPERIMENTAL SETUP
A. Adhesive Fabrication
The electrostatic adhesive fabrication process is described
in [9]. It consists of embedding a conductive mesh, which

contains an electrode pattern, into a soft silicone polymer.
The mesh not only acts as the conductive electrodes for
electrostatic adhesion but also serves as a reinforcement
to evenly distribute shear loads across the adhesive. This
electrostatic adhesive then functions similar to a reinforced
PDMS [13] but with an added electrostatic adhesive element
to provide a preload. Fabrication of an EDA was done using
the same basic process with one important distinction: a wax
mold containing the dry adhesive micro features is used to
create the ﬁbrillar structures.
Figure 3 shows the manufacturing for an EDA, which is
described below:
1) A thin, approximately 125 mm, layer of silicone is spun
onto a 75 mm wax directional dry adhesive mold. The
silicone is allowed to partially cure.
2) A second thin layer of silicone is spun on top of the
original, and the mesh is gently laid into the uncured
silicone. The silicone is then again partially cured.
3) A ﬁnal layer of silicone is spun on top to fully en-
capsulate the conductive electrodes and the silicone is
allowed to fully cure.
4) The EDA is complete and removed from the wax mold.
Using this process, 52mm diameter adhesives samples were
fabricated and bonded to three different backing structures,
described below.
B. Fluid Pouch Backing
A ﬂuid-ﬁlled backing mechanism that transfers normal
loads to the adhesive through internal ﬂuid pressure was
coupled with a tail mechanism via a revolute joint as shown
in Fig. 4. The tail mechanism transfers applied shear loads,
F
x
, to a Kevlar tendon that runs along the substrate material
(see Fig. 5). Shear loads are transmitted from the tendon
through a stress plate to the internal mesh that evenly
distributes the force across the pad surface. Applied normal
loads, F
z
, are then transferred directly into the ﬂuid ﬁlled
backing pouch mechanism. This design conforms easily to

surfaces since the adhesive element is constrained only at its
periphery by the silicone backing pouch and by the stiffness
of the adhesive itself.
To fabricate the mechanism, a ﬂexible cylindrical cup is
cast from a Shore 40A silicone (PlatSil 73-40) using an
acrylic mold. A rigid backing plate or “piston” is bonded to
the silicone pouch with a silicone rubber adhesive (SilPoxy).
This pouch element is then bonded directly to the back of
an electrostatic adhesive or EDA. An incompressible ﬂuid is
injected into the pouch, and the pouch is vacuum degassed.
For the experiments presented here, air was used due to its
relative incompressibility at the tested adhesion pressures.

load transfer to the adhesive and ensures that both normal

and shear forces are evenly distributed. However, this is at the
expense of conformation at the adhesive/substrate interface
level. The backing is manufactured using an FDM 3D printer
and bonded with a silicone rubber adhesive (SilPoxy) to the
electrostatic and EDA samples.
D. Hierarchical Fibrillar Backing
The hierarchical directional ﬁbrillar backing is inspired
by geckos and has demonstrated performance advantages
on rough surfaces and when scaling adhesive patch sizes
[7]. The backing layer consists of 400 mm diameter round
silicone polymer stalks oriented at 45
o
with respect to
the adhesive (see Fig. 7). These larger stalks provide a
suspension layer that allows for compliance in the normal
direction while still distributing shear and normal loads.
To create the polymer stalks, a mold was fabricated by
drilling 400 mm holes at 45
o
through a 2.38 mm acetal sheet.
This was placed into a mold cavity, ﬁlled with a shore 60A
silicone (Polytek 73-60), and vacuum degassed. After the
silicone was cured, the sheet of polymer stalks was removed
from the mold. One side of the sheet was then bonded to a
rigid backing while the stalk side was directly embedded into
the back of an electrostatic adhesive or EDA. This allowed
the ﬂatness of the adhesive to be preserved.
E. Test Stage
Tests were performed on a dedicated ﬁxture that measures
both normal and shear stress generated by the adhesive (see
Fig. 8). The test stage consists of a pneumatic air cylinder
oriented to induce a force on the adhesives at predeﬁned
pull-off angles. For all of the performed tests a single
adhesive sample was used for each adhesive/backing layer
combination and no performance degradation was observed.
Also, to simulate normal design operating conditions the
directional dry adhesive and EDA samples were tested in
their preferred direction.
The test stage is operated as follows:
1) the air slide is shifted forward and the adhesive mecha-
nism is gently placed onto the substrate withnopreload;
2) if required, a 5kV DC/DC converter (EMCO Q Series)
activates the electrostatic element, and there is a 10
second delay;

3) the variable pressure regulator increases the force output
of the air slide at a relatively slow rate of 7.8 N/s until
the adhesive mechanism is detached from the substrate;
4) during the detachment phase, data from the 6-DOF force
torque sensor is recorded at 2kHz using a National
Instruments data acquisition board and LabVIEW;
5) after the air slide reaches the maximum set output force,
77.9 N, it is shifted back to its home position and the
electrostatic element is deactivated;
6) the data is processed through a 3rd order Butterworth
ﬁlter at 10Hz to remove any unrepresentative load
variations due to dynamic effects; and
7) the peak normal and shear forces generated by the
adhesive are extracted.
Forces are then plotted on a shear verse normal adhesion plot
to give the mechanism’s limit curve on that substrate. The
limit curve represents the adhesive’s operating range.
III. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Tests were performed using the three backing mechanisms
and four adhesive technologies previously described on three
ceramic tiles with surface roughness from 15.7 to 28.4
mm RMS (see Table I). Roughness was measured using a
proﬁlometer along a 5 cm strip. Glass was not used due to
the very high adhesion values compared to the rougher tiles
and is only presented in Table I for reference. To compare

the different interface mechanisms, tests are ﬁrst shown for
Tile 1, the smoothest. The limit curves are then shown on
Tiles 2 and 3 to demonstrate the effect of surface roughness.
A. Adhesive Technology
Figure 9 shows the limit curves of the four different
adhesive technologies: PDMS, electrostatic, directional dry,
and EDA, using a ﬂat rigid backing on Tile 1. We chose
this combination of the smoothest tile and rigid backing to
isolate and highlight the differences in the adhesives.
Both the PDMS and directional dry adhesive show the
lowest shear and normal adhesion, but the directional dry
adhesive is notably stronger in shear. Note that these samples
undergo no mechanical preload, we simply place them on
the substrate. Compare those results with the electrostatic
and EDA samples. The added preload generated by the
electrostatic adhesive element allows for a greater portion of
the PDMS and directional dry adhesive elements to contact
the surface, thus creating substantially more adhesion.
The electrostatic adhesion has no directionality and the
limit curve is fairly linear. On the other hand, the EDA
demonstrates the typical frictional-adhesion plot [11], save
one difference. At zero shear load, the EDA has some
normal force. This can be eliminated if the electrostatic
adhesive is turned off, thus maintaining the controllability of
the adhesive. Moreover, the EDA demonstrates signiﬁcantly
increased adhesion compared to all other technologies.
B. Backing Mechanism
This subsection illustrates the differences in the backing
mechanisms.
Figure 10 shows the limit curves for the PDMS adhesive
using the three different backing mechanisms on Tile 1, the
smoothest tile. Due to the lack of a preload, the rigid backing
demonstrates the lowest levels of adhesion. This is because

even Tile 1 has micro-roughness that results in a low real
area of contact for the rigid backing.
The hierarchical backing provides relatively high levels
of shear adhesion, but low levels of normal adhesion. Con-
versely, the ﬂuid pouch provides very high normal adhesion,
but relatively little shear adhesion. We attribute this to
inefﬁciencies in the tail mechanism’s ability to transmit shear
loads to the adhesive. Compliance in the tendon attachment
points causes shear forces to inadvertently be transmitted
through the pouch structure. This can cause peeling moments
that may reduce overall peak adhesion.
Figure 11 is similar to Fig. 10 except for the presence
of the electrostatic adhesion element. The addition of the
normal preload supplied by the electrostatic adhesive element
assists the PDMS in making effective surface contact. Note
the greatest improvement is in the shear adhesion, which
more than doubles for each type of backing mechanism.

Fig. 13. Shear/normal adhesive limit curve for the three different backings
on Tile 1 using an EDA. Compared to Fig. 12, there are higher levels
of shear and normal adhesion. However, compared to Fig. 11, which uses
electrostatic adhesion without the ﬁbrillar stalks, there are much lower levels
of adhesion.
Figure 12 shows the directional dry adhesive’s perfor-
mance on Tile 1 for the three different backing mechanisms.
The hierarchical backing demonstrates high levels of shear
adhesion, but very little normal adhesion. In this case, the
normal adhesion is just slightly greater than that of the rigid
plate backing. The ﬂuid pouch again showed relatively high
levels of normal adhesion with poor levels of shear adhesion.
Figure 13 is similar to Fig. 12 except that Fig. 13 uses the
EDA. In this case, the EDA performs well with the rigid
plate and the hierarchical suspension. However, the ﬂuid
pouch shows poor performance when used with the EDA.
Again, we attribute this to the inefﬁcient shear load transfer
in the current tail mechanism design. With the EDA this is
particularly important, since the EDA relies on the induced
shear load to engage the directional dry adhesive stalks

with the substrate. Without proper engagement of the micro
features, the performance is greatly reduced, particularly in
the normal direction.
C. Surface Roughness
In this subsection, we demonstrate results on increasingly
rougher surfaces. Note that we only plot the results for the
hierarchical backing and ﬂuid pouch backing since the rigid
plate offers little to no adhesion on these surfaces.
Figure 14 shows the shear/normal adhesion plots for the
electrostatic adhesive on Tiles 2 and 3. Although some
adhesion is still present, it is signiﬁcantly less than the results
shown for Tile 1 in Fig. 11. Thus, while the hierarchical and
ﬂuid pouch backings do provide some levels of adhesion on
rougher surfaces, there is a limit to their abilities.
Figure 15 shows the results for the EDA on Tiles 2 and 3.
We originally suspected that the EDA would perform better
than the electrostatic adhesive on rougher surfaces due to
the fact that the stalks would be able to gain contact with
the bumps and crevices in the substrate. Looking at tile 2
this is not the case; the EDA gains the frictional-adhesion
proﬁle at the expense of both shear and normal adhesion.
However as the surface roughness is further increased we
can see the EDA adhesive providing an advantage. On tile 3
the shear and normal performance of the EDA exceeds that
of the electrostatic adhesive.
IV. CONCLUSION
This paper presented the shear/normal force limit curves
for a newly described electrostatic directional dry adhesive
on surfaces with varying degrees of roughness. The paper
also introduced a new ﬂuid-ﬁlled pouch mechanism designed
to effectively transmit shear and normal loads from the EDA
to a rigid structure. That mechanism was compared to two
other previously reported backing designs. Results showed
that the ﬂuid-ﬁlled pouch performed better in the normal
direction compared to a hierarchical suspension, but worse
in shear. Future work will focus on developing a solution
that provides high levels of both shear and normal adhesion
as well as integrating the device into a robotic gripper for
grappling and perching applications.
