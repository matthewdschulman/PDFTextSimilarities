Abstract— Bone-attached robots and so-called microstereo-
tactic frames are attracting increasing interest in the ﬁeld of
robot-assisted surgery due to the promising targeting accuracy
they provide. The authors propose a passive Stewart-Gough
platform which is attached to a patient’s head via bone anchors.
It serves as an instrument guidance in straight line incisions,
such as minimally invasive cochlear implantation. In this con-
tribution a modiﬁed version of the mechanism’s kinematics is
proposed, which reduces the number of required bone anchors
from six to three. Furthermore, a novel statistical approach
to optimize the design variables of the moving platform for
accuracy is presented. It is characterized by the ability to take
the probability distributions of all relevant error sources as well
as the given task redundancy and reconﬁgurability of the mech-
anism into account. Based on identiﬁed ranges of trajectories
and possible bone anchor locations, the optimization problem
is solved for a representative number of 1,000 ’virtual patients’.
The optimum mechanism design is obtained by analyzing
the resulting distributions of design variables. Monte Carlo
simulation is used to compare its targeting errors to those of
a previous prototype. Results reveal that the targeting error
is signiﬁcantly reduced in comparison to an initial prototype
thanks to the proposed optimization strategy.
I. INTRODUCTION
Cochlear implants can restore partial hearing to patients
suffering from severe hearing loss or deafness. The state
of the art surgical procedure comprises gaining access
to the inner ear (mastoidectomy), opening of the cochlea
(cochleostomy), and inserting an electrode in order to elec-
trically stimulate the auditory nerve. For the purpose of
reducing patients’ trauma, several research groups propose
a minimally invasive approach by drilling a canal from the
lateral skull base to the basal turn of the cochlea [1], [2],
[3], [4]. Due to the fact that the required targeting accuracy
is at least 0:5 mm, the direct cochlear access is considered as
a benchmark application for means of instrument guidance
[5]. Vital structures, such as the facial nerve and the chorda
tympani, are located in direct proximity to the drill trajectory,
thus increasing the demands on accuracy. Recently, bone-
attached robots and so-called microstereotactic frames have
demonstrated promising target accuracies [6], [7], [8]. Such
devices are attached directly to a patient’s skull via bone
anchors and provide instrument guidance along a predeﬁned,
straight line trajectory.
This work was funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG).

In this context, the authors propose a passive Stewart-
Gough platform, which requires six bone screws, implanted
at locations with appropriate skull thickness, as base joints
[9]. Spherical heads of the bone anchors serve as artiﬁcial
landmarks during trajectory planning, which is carried out
based on a Computed Tomography (CT) scan of the patient’s
skull. Since no ﬁxation frame is required, intervention plan-
ning ﬂexibility is increased compared to similar approaches.
Considering the drilling task, two redundant degrees of
freedom, i.e., platform height and rotation around the drill
axis, can be exploited during the preoperative planning
phase in order to optimize certain performance indices of
the manipulator with respect to stiffness and singularity
avoidance. Furthermore, the mechanism can be reconﬁgured
due to redundant joint connections. A detailed description of
the intended surgical workﬂow can be found in [9].
In order to reduce the invasiveness of the procedure,
a modiﬁed kinematic concept of the parallel mechanism,
which brings the number of required bone anchors down to
three, is introduced in this paper. Furthermore, to maximize
the targeting accuracy of the robot, an optimization of the
kinematic design parameters is proposed in this contribution.
So far, several researchers have reported on the design
optimization of parallel kinematic machines (PKMs) for
accuracy [10], [11], [12], [13]. With respect to the here
considered drilling task, the common approaches are not
suitable due to the following limitations. Firstly, the locations
of the base joints (bone anchors) vary strongly depending
on a patient’s anatomy. As a result, the workspace of the
PKM is speciﬁc to each surgical procedure, and thus can
not be generalized appropriately for design optimization.
Secondly, the optimization approaches found in the literature
do not take into account the given task redundancy and
reconﬁgurability. Therefore, a novel statistical approach to
the design optimization of a redundant and reconﬁgurable
mechanism is presented.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows:
Sect. II presents the proposed manipulator as well as a
kinematic concept to reduce the number of required bone
anchors from six to three. A kinematic error model, which
takes into account all relevant error sources affecting the tar-
geting accuracy of the mechanism, is introduced in Sect. III.
Furthermore, an appropriate criterion to optimize the design
variables for accuracy is derived, considering the speciﬁc
requirements of the proposed surgical application. In order
to solve the optimization problem, a novel strategy based on
a statistic representation of the entire input data is presented.
It allows to take into account the given task redundancy

and reconﬁgurability during optimization. The results of
the proposed procedure are given in Sect. IV, followed by
an approach to determine the achievable targeting accuracy
before and after optimization. Sect. V closes the paper and
gives an outlook on future work.
II. INVERSE KINEMATICS OF THE 6UPS PARALLEL
ROBOT
The proposed concept is based on a reconﬁgurable 6UPS
PKM which is similar to the well-known Stewart-Gough
platform (see Fig. 1). The pose (position and orientation)
of the moving platform is given by
x
E
= (x

E
; z
E
; 
E
; 
E

T

where x
E

E
represent the point of origin of
(CF)
E
with respect to (CF)
0
and 
E
, 
E
, and 
E
are its
orientation around the x-, y-, and z-axis, respectively. In
order to facilitate the here considered optimization procedure,
(CF)
E
is assumed at the target point t of the drill trajectory.
A passive prismatic joint (linear bearing) holding a surgical
tool is mounted on the moving platform, being aligned with
the z-axis of (CF)
E
. The location of the drilling axis with
respect to the center of the moving platform is characterized
by a
x
and a
y
. The pose of the platform can be adjusted by
changing the strut lengths 
i
. The system input is given by
the six actuator coordinates

a redundant degree of freedom (DOF), i.e., not necessarily

form height h

platform from the entry point e in z-direction of (CF)

i.e., additional, joint connections P

number of different conﬁgurations of the mechanism suitable
for the same trajectory. The platform joints are arranged on

The previously proposed concept of the parallel mech-
anism requires six bone anchors implanted in a patient’s
skull. In order to reduce the invasiveness and the number of
incisions, a modiﬁed version of the kinematics is introduced,
which brings the number of required bone anchors down to
three.
The main idea is to connect two struts using a rotational
joint having one degree of freedom (DOF) as depicted in
Fig. 2. Compared to the well-known Stewart-Gough plat-
form, the number of platform joints remains unchanged.
Furthermore, the mechanism maintains six DOF at the mov-
ing platform. The inverse kinematics problem is solved by
introducing two parameters x
v
and y
v
to characterize the
displacement of the rotational joint G
i+1
with respect to the
spherical base joint G
i
. Due to the design modiﬁcations,
the base joint G
i+1
(i = 1; 3; 5) lies in the plane deﬁned
by the known positions of G
i
, P
i+1
, and P
i
. Its location
can be computed by applying a translation of x

in
the aforementioned plane (see also Fig. 2, red plane). Once
the locations of G

III. DESIGN OPTIMIZATION FOR ACCURACY
A. Kinematic error model
Due to several factors, like manufacturing errors, joint
clearance and limited encoder resolution, the pose of the
moving platform can only be provided within a certain
accuracy. Referring to [15], the active joint errors  are
the major sources of error in a calibrated and precisely
manufactured parallel mechanism. An approximation of the
pose error

; z
E
; 
E

T
(11)
resulting from the limited encoder resolution of the struts
 can be obtained by rewriting the velocity equation (7)
in incremental form [15]:
x
E
=J : (12)
However, as simulation results reveal [9], the performance
of the proposed mechanism is limited by errors occurring
during the localization of its base joints G
i
in preoperatively
acquired CT images. Therefore, the differential kinematics
formulation (12) is extended in order to take such errors
into account. Furthermore, erroneous locations of the plat-
form joints P
i
, resulting from manufacturing tolerances, are
considered. This is achieved by deﬁning three error vectors

can be found in [16] and [17].
B. Optimization problem
In the following, an optimization criterion for accuracy
is derived from the kinematic error model presented in
Sect. III-A. Considering the proposed surgical procedure,
it is desirable to minimize the deviation from the desired
trajectory at the target point r
t
. Due to the fact that the
2366
origin of (CF)
E
equals r
t
, the position error at the target
results to:

A mapping from error sources e to the pose error of the
end effector x

is given by (19). In order to analyze the
characteristics of the transformation equation, it is recom-
mended to normalize the individual error sources , r
P
,
r

as well as the ETMK [11]. After normalization, (19)
can be rewritten as

the elements

It is important to note that, generally, the manipulator
Jacobian should be homogenized in order to obtain an ETM
invariant of the length units adopted. As it will be explained
in the following, the homogenization ofJ can be omitted in
the here considered case.
The error transformation (21) is characterized by the
six singular values 

(



K, which are
commonly referred to as Error Ampliﬁcation Factors (EAFs).
The smaller the EAF, the smaller the pose error [11]. With
respect to the drilling task, the position error at the target
(20) is considered the most relevant performance index of the
parallel mechanism. Therefore, only a representative subset

is used for the design optimization. This is due to the fact that
the singular values of
f

errors e to the elements of r

. In order to minimize the
error at the target, the cost function is deﬁned as:

as well as the strut-joint

.
Note that the angular errors 
E
, 
E
, and 
E
are not
included in the above equation and, therefore, the homoge-
nization ofJ can be omitted. An upper bound imposed on the
rotational deviations is considered sufﬁcient here. Therefore,
an inequality constraint is formulated. The errors 
E
, 
E
,
and 
E
are represented as a rotation '
a
around an axis
a. Then, the translational deviation d
'
from the desired
trajectory can be computed at any speciﬁc distance d
t
from
the target point using
d
'
=d
t
tan ('
a
): (26)
Here, d
t
= z
E
= 10 mm corresponds to the approximate
distance of the facial nerve from the target point.
The optimization problem is further constrained due to
self collisions between the struts. Moreover, mechanical
interference between the latter and the surgical tool must be
avoided. Therefore, the struts as well as the tool are modeled
by cylindrical segments having a diameter of 10 mm. Using
an algorithm proposed by Merlet [18], [19], the minimum
distances d
i;j
and d
i;tool
between a pair of segments and
between the struts and the surgical tool, respectively, can
be computed. Note that, due to the described modiﬁcations
of the kinematics, connected strut pairs do not require self
collision monitoring. Additional constraints result from the
redundant end effector DOFs being limited to 30 mm 

more, in order to obtain practical results, the strut lengths
are restricted to positive values 1 mm. The optimization

C. Distributions of bone anchor locations and trajectories
In order to obtain realistic input data for the design
optimization, a set of 20 clinical CT scans is analyzed. Drill
trajectory planning is carried out on these image datasets.
Each trajectory is characterized by the entry point of the
drillr
e
and the target pointr
t
, i.e., the desired cochleostomy
site. Then, appropriate locations for implanting the anchors
are identiﬁed using a software that provides a measure of the
skull thickness [20]. Here, regions providing skull thickness
 5 mm are considered suitable for bone screw placement.
Three regions per CT scan are deﬁned, which corresponds
to the number of required anchors. Finally, the suitable
regions as well as the planned trajectories are registered
and expressed in one single coordinate frame. Based on
these data, the statistical distributions of suitable bone anchor
locations and corresponding drill trajectories can be deﬁned.
2367
Here, it is assumed that each region is characterized by
points that are three-variate normally distributed. Therefore,
a compact representation of each region is obtained by
ﬁtting a three-variate normal distribution using the method
of moments. The same procedure is carried out for the
entry and target points of the planned trajectories. Once the
distribution parameters are known, an arbitrary number of
representative planning datasets (each comprising three bone
anchor locations and one drill trajectory) can be generated.
D. Error parametrization
The proposed approach to design optimization requires the
error sources involved in (19) to be parametrized appropri-
ately. Here, the locations of the base jointsr
Gi
are subject to
errors occurring during the localization in a CT scan of the
patient’s skull. In the ﬁeld of medical image registration, this
is commonly referred to as the Fiducial Localization Error
(FLE) [21]. In previous experiments, it was found that a
base joint FLE
Gi
of approximately 0:06 mm can be achieved
using steel spheres with a diameter of 8 mm and a ﬂat-
panel, cone-beam CT scanner (Xoran xCAT
R 
ENT, Xoran
Technologies, Ann Arbor, MI, USA) which has an isotropic
resolution of 0:3 mm x 0:3 mm x 0:3 mm [22]. According to
the widely accepted error theory, G
i;x
, G
i;y
, and G
i;z
are modeled as random, independent vectors of FLE
Gi
,
whose elements are statistically independent and drawn from
a three-variate normal distribution with zero means
G
and
the variance matrix 
G
stated in Tab. I [23]. Note that the
diagonal elements of 
G

3;3

G
i
=3. Due to the modiﬁed kinematics, the number
of base joints being localized in a CT scan is reduced to three.
Therefore, in the following, r
G1
= r
G2
, r
G3
= r
G4
,
and r
G5
= r
G6
.
A similar formulation is established considering the lo-
cations r
Pi
of the platform joints, which are affected by
manufacturing tolerances. In the here considered case, it
is assumed that the positions of P
i
can be measured after
fabrication using a Faro GagePlus coordinate measuring
machine (Faro Technologies Inc., Lake Mary, FL, USA)
which has an isotropic FLE
Pi
of 0:025 mm.
The strut length inaccuracies are taken from datasheets
and measure 0:006 mm. Furthermore, the limited resolution
of the encoders leads to an additional round off error being
0:005 mm in the worst case. Therefore, 
i
is assumed to be
uniformly distributed within the interval [0 mm, 0:011 mm].

E. Optimization strategy
The cost function deﬁned in (25) enables an optimization
of the mechanism’s design variables for accuracy. However,
the formulations and, therefore, the optimization results
depend on the assumed conﬁguration of the mechanism, i.e.,
the base joint locations and the desired drill trajectory. As
already mentioned in Sect. I, this outcome is undesirable
since the targeting accuracy of the PKM is increased solely
for one conﬁguration. In order to obtain practical results, a
statistical approach to the design optimization is performed.
The following procedure is repeated 1,000 times.
Based on the identiﬁed statistical distributions of base
joint locations and corresponding drill trajectories, a random
planning dataset (virtual patient) is generated. Furthermore,
the entries in e are drawn from the distributions derived
in Sect. III-D. The optimization problem is then formulated
as described in the previous section. Initialization of the
parameters is performed based on the speciﬁcations of a
previous prototype [9]. In this context, all values in  are
normalized to the range [0 1] to account for inhomogeneous
magnitudes. Furthermore, the non-redundant coordinates of
the end effector, i.e., x
E
, y
E
, 
E
, and 
E
, are set in such
a way that the tool axis is aligned with the desired trajec-
tory. Finally, the constrained optimization problem is solved
using an active-set algorithm [24]. During optimization, task
redundancy is exploited, i.e., the rotation around the tool axis
as well as the platform height are determined. Furthermore,
reconﬁgurability of the mechanism is considered by solving
the optimization problem for each applicable set of strut-joint
pairings P
sel
(brute force approach). The optimum set and
corresponding values in ^  are ﬁnally identiﬁed based on the
minimum cost.
IV. RESULTS
The procedure described in Sect. III-C results in statistical
distributions of bone anchor locations and trajectories. Tab. II
lists the identiﬁed means  and corresponding variance
matrices  of the assumed three-variate normal distributions.
The optimization problem formulated in Sect. III-B is
solved for the 1,000 considered virtual patients. This yields
one optimized robot conﬁguration ^ 
i
per planning dataset. In
166 cases, no valid solution is obtained due to self collisions
of the struts or interference between the latter and the surgical
tool. The cause lies in partially overlapping distributions of
base joint G
1
and the entry point e of the drill trajectory
(see also Tab. II). If the distance between these two points is
less than 10 mm, the optimization problem has no valid so-
lution due to the continuous collision monitoring. However,
considering clinical application, this represents an unrealistic
scenario. Therefore, the evaluation is performed based on the
remaining 834 sets of optimization results ^ 

In order to assess the impact of the optimized design
on the accuracy at the target of each drill trajectory, a
Monte Carlo simulation is carried out using the kinematic
error model given in (18). All planning datasets used during
the optimization (virtual patients) are evaluated by drawing
10,000 samples for e from the distributions given in
Sect. III-D, and then computing r

as deﬁned in (20). This
results in one random vector (10,000 samples of r

Fig. 5 gives the mean targeting errors r

for an arbitrarily chosen subset

designed mechanism exhibits the largest targeting errors in
all cases. Thanks to the proposed optimization procedure, the
targeting errors as well as the standard deviations determined
by Monte Carlo simulation are signiﬁcantly reduced. The
accuracy of the optimized manipulator design is slightly infe-
rior to the gold standard, i.e., the patient speciﬁc mechanism
design.
The frequency distributions of the mean targeting errors,
resulting when analyzing the total number of virtual pa-
tients, are given in Fig. 6 for the three considered sce-
narios. Note that, in this representation, the standard de-
viations 

of the errors are omitted. Again, the gold
standard mechanisms provide the highest targeting accura-
cies. The mean and the standard deviation of the observed

are (0:059 0:007) mm. The mean targeting error
of the optimized mechanism with constant design param-
eters is slightly larger, being (0:065 0:014) mm. Com-
pared to the intuitively deﬁned mechanism, which, according
to the simulation results, provides a mean accuracy of
(0:110 0:027) mm, the targeting error is reduced by ap-
proximately 40 % through the proposed design optimization.

V. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper, a novel, statistical approach to the design
optimization of a parallel mechanism for skull surgery is
presented. Compared to previous studies, the given task
redundancy of the mechanism as well as its reconﬁgurability
are taken into account. For this purpose, a kinematic model
including all relevant error sources is used. The latter are
represented using probability distributions which approxi-
mate experimental data. Furthermore, with respect to the
here considered application, the range of possible base joint
locations and corresponding trajectories has been determined
and expressed accordingly. Hence, all input parameters of
the kinematic error model are given by one consistent
representation. As a result, an arbitrary number of realistic
planning datasets (virtual patients), including base joints, a
trajectory and an error source vector, can be generated based
on the previously identiﬁed statistical distributions. Here,
the optimum design parameters of the parallel mechanism’s
platform are determined by minimization of the error am-
pliﬁcation factors for a set of 1,000 virtual patients, and
subsequent analysis of the resulting frequency distributions.
The achievable targeting accuracy is then evaluated by Monte
Carlo simulation. Results reveal that the proposed approach
reduces the mean targeting errors by approx. 40 % with
respect to an intuitively chosen mechanism design previously
proposed.
Compared to patient speciﬁc mechanism designs, which
we consider the gold standard with respect to targeting accu-
racy, the optimized mechanism resembles the best achievable
2370
compromise. With that in mind, the difference in the mean
targeting accuracy is relatively small. This is due to the
fact that exploiting the given task redundancy and recon-
ﬁgurability of the mechanism has a signiﬁcant effect on its
performance. As the results reveal, minor deviations from
the patient speciﬁc design optimum can be compensated for
in terms of the achievable targeting accuracy.
In future work we intend to study the effect of including
more design variables, e.g., the platform joint locationsr
Pi
,
in the proposed procedure. Finally, a prototype has to be built
based on the resulting speciﬁcations to enable experimental
evaluation of the achievable targeting accuracy.
