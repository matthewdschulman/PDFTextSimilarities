Selecting Best Viewpoint for Human-Pose Estimation
Kai-Chi Chan, Cheng-Kok Koh and C. S. George Lee
Abstract— Estimating human poses is an important step
towards developing robots that can understand human motion.
Since a human is highly articulated, changing viewpoints of
sensors on robots can improve the accuracy of human-pose
estimation. We propose a two-phase approach that determines
the best viewpoint of a depth sensor for human-pose estimation.
The proposed approach measures the quality of potential
viewpoints and selects one of them as the best viewpoint
for each human pose. Based on the quality of viewpoints,
human poses can be directly mapped to the best viewpoint
without reconstructing the human body. Thus, the proposed
approach provides a discriminative mapping to determine
the best viewpoint for estimating different human poses. To
measure the quality of a potential viewpoint, the viewpoint
is ﬁrst instantiated by representing the depth sensor of the
viewpoint using the ﬁnite projective camera model. The quality
of the viewpoint is expressed in terms of the error of human-
pose estimates. A mapping is derived by minimizing the
error in a human-pose estimate among different viewpoints.
The proposed two-phase approach has been evaluated on a
benchmark database. Experimental results showed that the
best viewpoint for a human pose could be determined by
evaluating the quality of potential viewpoints. The mean error
and standard deviation of human-pose estimates were reduced
by using the best viewpoint determined by the proposed two-
phase approach.
I. INTRODUCTION
Estimating human poses is important in human-motion
analysis, which is beneﬁcial to the development of robots’
cognitive capabilities. Most previous and related work about
human-pose estimation are based on stationary sensors [1]–
[5]. In many applications, robots equipped with sensors can
be considered to be moving sensors, and the mobility of
robots with sensors could improve the accuracy of estimating
human poses by determining the best viewpoint of sensors.
Figure 1 shows a Hubo-II+ humanoid robot and a P3-DX
mobile robot in our ARTLab, each mounted with an RGB-D
sensor, and both can be considered to be moving sensors.
Using a moving robot equipped with an RGB-D sensor,
the process of human-pose estimation involves iterations
of three stages — human-pose prediction, best-viewpoint
determination, and moving the robot to the best-viewpoint
location. When a robot observes a person at time t, the future
pose of the person at t+dt is predicted, wheredt is the time

to account for the movement of the robot. The best viewpoint
for the predicted human pose is determined. The robot can
then be moved to the best viewpoint in dt. The process is
then repeated. In this paper, we focus on the problem in
the second stage; that is, for a given predicted human pose,
we determine the best viewpoint, which includes the position
and orientation, of a depth sensor for human-pose estimation.
The problems of human-pose prediction and moving the
robot to the best viewpoint will be our future work.

Past research work in ﬁnding the best viewpoint has
mainly focused on rigid and stationary objects [6], [7].
An information gain [8], [9] has been derived to represent
the amount of new information for each viewpoint. The
viewpoint that maximizes the information gain is deemed
the best and selected. Unfortunately, an information gain is
not directly applicable in human-pose estimation for two
main reasons. First, a change in human posture alters an
information gain. The best viewpoint selected based on
the information gain of a previous human posture does
not, in general, maximize the amount of new information
under the current human posture. Second, computing an
information gain involves object reconstruction. Object (i.e.,
human-body) reconstruction is affected by human posture
because some body parts may be occluded. Hence, an
information gain may not accurately represent the amount
of new information for a viewpoint.
In this paper, instead of using information gain and
estimating human poses from human-body reconstruction,

we propose a two-phase approach to determine the best
viewpoint for estimating human poses, assuming that the
number of potential viewpoints is ﬁxed and the potential
viewpoints are given. Hence, the best viewpoint can be
determined by examining all the potential viewpoints. Fol-
lowing the proposed approach, an object (human) whose
pose being estimated can be rigid or articulated. Also, object
reconstruction is not required. Experimental results showed
that the proposed two-phase approach could determine the
best viewpoint for each human pose, and hence reduce the
mean error and standard deviation in human-pose estimation.
II. PROPOSED TWO-PHASE APPROACH
The proposed two-phase approach consists of training
and estimation phases. In the training phase, we propose
a viewpoint-evaluation framework to train the mapping be-
tween a human pose directly to the best viewpoint of a
depth sensor. The best viewpoint is determined based on the
accuracy of human-pose estimates, without reconstructing a
human body. Multiple depth sensors at potential viewpoints
are used to capture the 3D point cloud of a person. The
quality of a potential viewpoint for human-pose estimation
is evaluated in terms of the accuracy of human-pose esti-
mates by matching the geometric VISH feature [10] from
different viewpoints. The best viewpoint is then determined
by selecting the viewpoint with the lowest average error in
human-pose estimation.
In the estimation phase, we use a single depth sensor that
is mounted on a humanoid robot. At the current viewpoint,
a human pose is ﬁrst estimated. The human-pose estimate is
then used as input to the mapping that has been trained in
the training phase to determine the best viewpoint for that
human-pose estimate. Once the best viewpoint is determined,
the robot can then be moved to the best viewpoint to estimate
the human pose. We shall describe the two phases in more
detail next.
A. Training Phase: Viewpoint-Evaluation Framework
Due to the mobility of robots/sensors, existing methods
that are based on human-body reconstruction require an
update of human-body shape in calculating an information
gain. Since a human is highly articulated, modeling human-
body shape directly is intractable. Simply assuming indepen-
dence among body parts, however, cannot reﬂect the reality,
and hence can result in modeling errors. Thus, instead of
generating a human-body shape for each update, we propose
a viewpoint-evaluation framework to measure the quality
of potential viewpoints and directly establish the mapping
between a human pose and the best viewpoint of a depth
sensor for that human pose using the viewpoint quality. As
the proposed framework is derived based on a supervised
learning algorithm, we build a human-pose database that
consists of a set of human poses and the corresponding 3D
point clouds at potential viewpoints. The mapping can be
considered as a discriminative/conditional relationship that
does not require modeling the joint distribution of human-
body shape and the best viewpoint.
Figure 2 shows the overall schematic ﬂow of the pro-
posed viewpoint-evaluation framework, which has four main
stages: 1) 3D-point-cloud pre-processing, 2) viewpoint in-
stantiation, 3) feature extraction and pose estimation, and
4) viewpoint evaluation. The ﬁrst three stages process 3D
point clouds to estimate human poses, and the ﬁnal stage
determines the mapping between a human pose and the best
viewpoint of a depth sensor. We next describe the function
of each stage.
1) Pre-processing of a 3D Point Cloud: 3D point clouds
are pre-processed such that the 3D points corresponding to a
human are extracted and outliers are removed to retain only
3D points that are of interest. We assume that the person,
whose human pose is to be estimated, performs different
actions in a predeﬁned 3D region. Therefore, we ﬁrst remove
the 3D points outside the region, and the removal process is
done by examining the 3D coordinates of points to determine
if the points lie in the region. Because of the measurement
noise from the depth sensor, we apply spatial smoothing
by removing the outliers based on the Euclidean distance
between neighboring points. We assume that the Euclidean
distance between two neighboring points in the 3D point
cloud follows a Gaussian distribution, and 3D points that
deviate from the mean of the Gaussian distribution more
than one standard deviation are considered as outliers and
are removed. The resulting point cloud after removing the
outliers is denoted asP
H
.
2) Viewpoint Instantiation: As the depth images of the
3D point clouds after pre-processing are different from
the depth images directly obtained from the depth sensors,
depth images from each potential viewpoint are instantiated
for feature extraction. We use the ﬁnite projective camera
model [11] to represent each depth sensor. The focal length,
denoted as f , the skew parameter, denoted as s and the
principal point, denoted as (p
x
; p
y
), of a depth sensor are
4845
measured and stored in the camera calibration matrix, de-
noted as K, as follows:

where m
x
and m
y
are the numbers of pixels per unit
distance in image coordinates along the x- and y-direction
respectively.
The orientation and the center of the camera coordinate
frame of the depth sensor can be represented by a 33
rotation matrix and a 31 position vector, respectively, in
the world coordinate frame. Then, the mapping between a
point in the world coordinate frame and an image point in
the camera coordinate frame can be represented as follows:

where x is the homogeneous coordinates of an image point
in the camera coordinate frame and X is the homogeneous
coordinates of a point in the world coordinate frame, K is
the camera calibration matrix, R is the 33 rotation matrix,
and (x
c
;y
c
;z
c
) are the coordinates of the camera center in
the world coordinate frame.
Figure 2(b) shows an example of viewpoint instantiation.
In the ﬁgure, depth images of the point clouds P
H
at
potential viewpoints are shown. For each point in the point
cloudP
H
, the corresponding image point in a depth image
from a viewpoint can be calculated using Eq. (2). Each
depth image from a potential viewpoint is generated by
aggregating the image points with intensity values equal to
the distance between the points in the point cloudP
H
and
the depth sensor at that viewpoint along the principal axis
of the sensor. For those points in the point cloudP
H
that
project on the same image point, only the point closest to
the viewpoint is selected.
3) Feature Extraction and Pose Estimation: The geo-
metric VISH feature [10] is extracted from the depth im-
age of the point cloud P
H
for human-pose estimation.
While extracting the VISH feature, the point cloud P
H
is partitioned and replicated into a tree structure as nodes.
VFH [12] and shape features are extracted from each node
in the tree to provide a descriptor to represent each node.
As the features are obtained based on histograms, coarse-
level detail is highlighted in large regions and ﬁne-level
detail is highlighted in small regions. Therefore, the features
from the point clouds in the tree can capture coarse-to-ﬁne
information. A human pose is then estimated by matching
the VISH feature with the VISH features of other depth
images from the same viewpoint in the human-pose database
using the k-nearest neighbor algorithm (k-NN) [13].
4) Viewpoint Evaluation: The mapping between a human
pose and the best viewpoint, denoted as M, is a function that
is deﬁned as follows:
M : P! V; (3)
where P is a set of human poses and V is a set of potential
viewpoints.
The quality of a viewpoint v for a human pose p, denoted
as Q
v;p
, depends on the costs from all the joints in the human
pose p. The cost of a joint j is calculated based on the
Euclidean distance between the joint position estimated by
k-NN and the ground-truth position of that joint. As the
feature of the human pose p is less similar to the features of
the human-pose estimates with lower rank in k-NN, the cost
is weighted to reﬂect the ranking of human-pose estimates.
Mathematically, the weighted cost of the joint j in the human
pose p at viewpoint v is given by
c
j;p;v;r
=
1
r
kj
p
 
˜
j
p;v;r

; (4)
where r is the rank of the human pose estimated by k-NN,
j
p
is the ground-truth position of the joint j in the human
pose p,
˜
j
p;v;r
is the position of the joint j in the rth human-
pose estimate of the human pose p found by k-NN using the
features extracted at viewpoint v, andkk
2
is the Euclidean
norm. Hence, the weighted cost can measure the accuracy of
human-pose estimates and reﬂect the quality of a viewpoint.
For a more accurate human-pose estimate at a particular
viewpoint, the weighted cost is lower compared with the
weighted costs of joints from the human-pose estimates with
the same rank at other viewpoints. Therefore, the quality of
a viewpoint Q
v;p
is deﬁned in terms of the weighted costs
as follows:
Q
v;p
= E[c
2
j;p;v;r
]; (5)
where E[] is the expectation operator over all the joints in
the human poses estimated by k-NN. The quality Q
v;p
is the
negation of the mean-squared error of the weighted costs. It
can be expressed as
Q
v;p
= E[c
j;p;v;r
]
2
 Var(c
j;p;v;r
); (6)
where Var() is the variance operator.
The weighted cost is a function of the observations of
the depth images generated from different viewpoints. Given
a viewpoint, we can compute the quality of the viewpoint
using Eq. (6). All the viewpoints with quality higher than or
equal to a predeﬁned threshold are compared and the best
viewpoint of a human pose is then found by maximizing
the quality of viewpoints. Hence, the mapping between the
human pose p and the best viewpoint is given by
M(p)=

where t is a predeﬁned threshold and null means that the
best viewpoint does not exist for that human pose as no
viewpoint has met the threshold.
The derivation of the mapping M is summarized in the
supervised learning algorithm as illustrated in Algorithm 1.

B. Estimation Phase: Best-Viewpoint Determination
During the estimation phase, a single depth sensor, which
is mounted on a robot, is used to estimate human poses. The
best viewpoint of the depth sensor can be determined by
the mapping M in which the output varies among different
human poses. Therefore, a human pose is ﬁrst estimated
based on the VISH features. The best viewpoint is then found
by the mapping M using the estimated human pose.
To estimate human poses, a 3D point cloud captured by
the depth sensor mounted on a robot is pre-processed to
remove the outliers in the 3D point cloud and extract the 3D
point cloud corresponding to the human. The VISH feature
is then extracted from the 3D point cloud of the human
and matched with the VISH features from the human-pose
database which contains both the 3D point clouds of the
human and the corresponding ground-truth human poses.

III. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
The proposed two-phase approach was evaluated
on the Berkeley Multimodal Human Action Database
(MHAD) [14]. In the database, a subject performing an
action was captured by two Microsoft Kinect sensors. Only
depth images, which were captured by the depth sensors
in the Microsoft Kinect sensors, were used throughout
the experiment. The depth images were captured at 30
frames per second at a resolution of 640 480 pixels.

Fig. 3: The viewpoints of depth sensors in the training phase.
In the pre-processing stage, the predeﬁned 3D region with
size 17:5207:5 m
3
was set. In the feature-extraction stage,
two levels were used in the tree structure, and six child nodes
were split from the root node in the tree. The size of the
2D region for extracting the shape features was set to be
1717 pixels. To evaluate the performance of the proposed
two-phase approach, the domain of the mapping M was set
to the set of ground-truth human poses in the human-pose
database. The range of the mapping M was set as a collection
of the sixteen viewpoints as shown in Fig. 3. Two Microsoft
Kinect sensors were located at viewpoints 1 and 3 in the
training phase. The other viewpoints were constructed using
the ﬁnite projective camera model [11]. Under this setting,
viewpoints were located around the subject as shown in the
ﬁgure. The red points and the green points represented the
3D points captured from the front and the back of the subject
4847
from viewpoints 1 and 3, respectively. From each viewpoint,
human poses were estimated using k-NN and k was set to 1.
One percent of the human-pose database were used as the
samples in calculating the weighted costs. The threshold t
in the mapping M was set to be the summation of the mean
of the weighted costs and three times the standard deviation
of the weighted costs.
We assumed that a humanoid robot with a depth sensor
was located at one of the sixteen viewpoints at the beginning.
As this work did not involve human-pose prediction and
moving the robot to the best viewpoint, we assumed that
the humanoid robot could move instantaneously to any of the
other viewpoints. In other words, the human pose remained
the same while the humanoid robot moved to different
viewpoints. A human pose was ﬁrst estimated at the current
viewpoint so that it could be used as input to the mapping
M to determine the best viewpoint for that human-pose
estimate. The humanoid robot was then “moved” to the best
viewpoint instantaneously to estimate the human pose. The
error between the human-pose estimate at the best viewpoint
and the ground-truth human pose was then calculated using
Eq. (11). Each test was veriﬁed using 5-fold cross-validation.
Table I shows the mean error and standard deviation of
human-pose estimation on a subject using a ﬁxed viewpoint
and the best viewpoints determined by the proposed two-
phase approach. The humanoid robot was located at an
original viewpoint at the beginning. Using the ﬁxed view-
point, the humanoid robot remained stationary at the original
viewpoint and human poses were estimated using the VISH
features [10]. The errors of human-pose estimates were
calculated using Eq. (11). The second and third columns
of Table I showed the mean errors and standard deviations
of the human-pose estimates at different ﬁxed viewpoints.
Using the two-phase approach, the humanoid robot was
“moved” to the best viewpoint based on the mapping M.
Thus, human poses were estimated at their best viewpoints.
The fourth and ﬁfth columns showed the mean errors and
standard deviations of the human-pose estimates at the best
viewpoints. Both mean errors and standard deviations were
decreased for all the viewpoints. The maximum reduction
of mean error occurred at viewpoint 1. The mean error
was reduced by about 26%. The maximum reduction of
standard deviation occurred at viewpoint 5. The standard
deviation was reduced by about 26%. The statistical results
showed that the proposed two-phase approach could select
the viewpoints with more accurate human-pose estimates
among the sixteen viewpoints and reduce the error in human-
pose estimation.
Figure 4 shows the best viewpoints determined by the
mapping M in the two-phase approach for some human
poses estimated at four viewpoints (viewpoints 1, 2, 3 and
4) for illustration. The leftmost column shows the 3D point
clouds of a subject performing different actions and the
corresponding ground-truth 3D human poses. The other
columns show the depth images of the 3D point clouds
from different viewpoints and the corresponding human-
pose estimates. The depth images and human-pose estimates

from the best viewpoints determined by the mapping M
are highlighted. For comparison purpose, ground-truth 3D
human poses and human-pose estimates are translated and
rotated such that all joint positions are referenced from
the same coordinate frame. In the ﬁgure, some of the
human-pose estimates for the human poses in the ﬁrst two
rows were in actions different from the ground-truth human
poses. For example, the ground-truth human pose in the
ﬁrst row was raising both arms but the human-pose estimate
from viewpoint 3 was lowering both arms downwards. The
human pose in the second row was raising one arm but
the human-pose estimates from viewpoints 1 and 4 were
raising both arms. It showed that the accuracy of human-pose
estimates was affected by the human poses of the subject
and the viewpoints of the sensor. Thus, switching among
the viewpoints is important in reducing the error in human-
pose estimation.
In the ﬁrst row, viewpoint 1 was selected as the best
viewpoint. Among the four viewpoints, the human-pose
estimates from the viewpoints 1, 2 and 4 were similar to
the ground-truth human pose. The error of the human-pose
estimate from viewpoint 1 was the lowest. It showed that the
mapping M in the two-phase approach was able to select the
best viewpoint. In the second row, the human-pose estimates
from the viewpoints 2 and 3 were similar to the ground-truth
human pose. The error incurred by the human-pose estimate
from viewpoint 2 was the lowest, and the proposed approach
selected viewpoint 2 as the best viewpoint.
In the third row, all the human-pose estimates were similar
to the ground-truth human pose. Among the four human-
pose estimates, the error of the human-pose estimate from
viewpoint 3 was the lowest. The mapping M could identify
the human-pose estimate and selected viewpoint 3 as the best
viewpoint. In the last row, the human-pose estimate from
viewpoint 4 was closest to the ground-truth human pose.
However, the mapping M selected both viewpoints 1 and 4 as
the best viewpoint for the ground-truth human pose because
the nearest neighbors of the ground-truth human pose from
4848

framework using the two-phase approach.
the two viewpoints in the training data were different. In
addition, the best viewpoints determined by the mapping
M for the two nearest neighbors were viewpoints 1 and 4.
It showed that the human-pose estimates from viewpoints
1 and 4 were very close to each other. Thus, for similar
ground-truth human poses in the training data, the errors
of the human-pose estimates from viewpoints 1 and 4 were
similar. By allowing more than one viewpoint as the best
viewpoint, there can be potentially more feasible solutions
when combining the sensor movement constraint with other
constraints such as motion planning.
IV. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper, we proposed the two-phase approach to
determine the best viewpoint for human-pose estimation.
Since human posture could be changed over time, existing
methods based on an information gain had difﬁculties in
updating a human-body shape. The proposed approach can
determine the best viewpoint for each human pose directly
without human-body reconstruction.
In the training phase, we proposed the viewpoint-
evaluation framework to measure the quality of poten-
tial viewpoints for human-pose estimation. The proposed
framework consisted of four stages: 3D-point-cloud pre-
processing, viewpoint instantiation, feature extraction and
pose estimation, and viewpoint evaluation. The 3D point
cloud of a person captured by depth sensors was ﬁrst
extracted and ﬁltered. The viewpoints of the depth sensors
were instantiated using the ﬁnite projective camera model.
The VISH features were then extracted from the depth
images generated from the instantiated viewpoints. Each
viewpoint was evaluated for every human pose estimated
by k-NN based on the matching of the VISH features.
In the estimation phase, we used a single depth sensor
that was mounted on a humanoid robot. A human pose
was ﬁrst estimated at the current viewpoint and the estimate
was then used as input to the mapping that determined the
best viewpoint for that human-pose estimate. Once the best
viewpoint was found, the robot was moved instantaneously
to the best viewpoint to estimate the human pose.
Experimental results showed that different viewpoints
would affect the accuracy of human-pose estimates. The
mapping in the proposed framework could identify the best
viewpoint for each human pose and hence reduce the mean
error and standard deviation of the human-pose estimate.
The maximum reductions of the mean error and standard
deviation were about 26% and 26%, respectively.
In the future, we will determine the optimal number of
potential viewpoints by studying the relationship between
the accuracy of human-pose estimation and the number of
potential viewpoints. We will also study how to predict
human poses after the time delay for a robot to move among
different viewpoints because a human could be disturbed and
change his/her pose while a robot is moving to the optimal
viewpoint. We will also extend the proposed approach with
multiple sensors.
