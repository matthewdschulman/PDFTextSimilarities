AbstractÑRobot calibration is widely used in the manufac-
ture industry to enhance and achieve a higher level of accuracy
on industrial robot manipulators. Currently, there are many
reliablecalibrationsystemsabletoperformthecalibrationtask.
Those systems, however, are far from being a user friendly
calibration tool; they are time consuming, very expensive, and
usually requires a lot of human interaction. Therefore, we
proposed a new calibration system able to overcome those
problemswithpromisingresults.However,totakethesystemto
the next level, and create an automated calibration process, we
need to create a control system capable of guiding the robotÕs
tool center point to a multi-position alignment. Throughout this
paper the control approach needed to achieve automation of
the entire system is presented and discussed. Simulations and
experimental results demonstrated the feasibility of the overall
calibration system including hardware, software and control
algorithms.
I. INTRODUCTION
In our modern era, the complexity of industrialization had
played an important role in developing a strong economy,
typically related to technological innovation in manufactur-
ing. Manufacturing in general, involves the development of
large-scale productions utilizing industrial robots to create
assembly lines. Generally industrial robots reach high re-
peatability levels and for repetitive applications, they are able
to perform such tasks successfully. Certainly repeatability
demonstrates the quality of a modern robot and their precise
positioning capabilities. However, it is also well-known that
industrial robots possess high repeatability but low accuracy
[1]. Nevertheless, the recent demand of high accuracy ap-
plications such as welding tasks, micro assembly operations,
surgery, etc. have increased the importance and interests of
robot calibration among researchers over the last decades.
Although there have been signiÞcant improvements in terms
of accuracy on the newly designed industrial robot models,
for such high accuracy applications, the accuracy of the
robot alone is not enough. While there are several sources of
inaccuracies (e.g. thermal expansions, gear errors, structural
deformations, etc.), the main source of errors lies in the
kinematic parameters deÞned within the robotÕs controller.
According to [2] and [3], around 90% of the inaccuracy in
robot positioning is mostly due to errors at the initial joint
values of the robot. Without an appropriate robot calibration,

any robotic system will experience accuracy degradation
over time. Due to this fact, robot calibration has been
used to improve the position and orientation accuracy of
industrial robots by identifying inaccuracies in the kinematic
parameters in order to create a more accurate model that
better Þts the real robot.
There are many calibration approaches that have been
designed by researchers with promising methodologies to
calibrate industrial robots. Some of them collect accurate
position data of the robot tool center point (TCP) by using
highly precise equipment such as Computer Numerical Con-
trolled (CNC) machines [4], Inclinometers [5], Theodolites
[6], Coordinate Measurement Machines (CMMs) [7] and
laser tracking systems [8]. Other methods impose some phys-
ical limitations on the TCP to form a closed kinematic chain.
Such methods are required to Þx one or more position and
orientation constraints to the TCP. This allows to generate an
equation system capable of determining a set of parameters,
also known as self-calibration system. Due to this particular
advantage, self-calibration systems are widely investigated
and analyzed more than any other methods. Furthermore,
additional expensive measuring devices are not required. In
[9] the authors measured the position and poses of a robot
by matching the pin of the TCP to an aperture on a dime.
Additionally, vision-based systems have been developed to
perform the calibration task. In those systems however, the
lack of resolution under wide Þelds of view is a major
problem, as well as the low frame rate cameras possess [10].
Because those devices are so expensive, or their procedures
are time consuming, they are difÞcult to be used extensively
in the manufacturing plants. For instance, a Laser Tracker
System can cost up to $100,000 US dollars. Therefore, it
is particularly important to design a system which could be
both cost-effective and easy to implement, while still be able
to achieve a high level of accuracy.
This paper presents a robot control system for our optical
approach based on 2 PSDs (i.e. Position Sensitive Detectors)
to improve the calibration process in respect to time, reliabil-
ity, and cost aspects that other methods still lack. Our focus
will be concentrated in the control methodology that offers
the solution to reduce or even eliminate the need for human
interaction in the process. During the calibration process,
the procedure to aim a laser beam at the center of each
sensor will only repeat twice, so the approach is faster and
simpler than our previous methods [11], [12]. Experiments
and simulations were conducted on an ABB industrial robot
(IRB120) to verify the feasibility of the proposed control
method as well as the newly developed calibration system.

II. AUTOMATED CALIBRATION SYSTEM OVERVIEW
A. Data Acquisition System
Our proposed calibration system approach [13] requires
a laser beam to shoot into one PSD in a way that the
reßection hits the other PSD. The idea behind this is to be
able to Þnd a unique line based on these two points (found
accurately). Therefore we employed two PSDs Þxed with an
angle between them, to Þnd such constrained line. A picture
of such device is shown in Figure 3 to the right.
Internally our device must be able to carry the signal
information from the PSDs to the computer in order to
control the robot to the desired state. Figure 1 highlights
the basic internal components of the device as well as the
interaction between the device and the robot controller.

After the processing circuit board gets the raw data from
the two sensors, the signals are taken by a wireless USB hub
through a data acquisition card. Detailed information about
the data acquisition system is explained more extensively
in [14]. Once the data reaches the computer we implement
our PC-based controller so that the robot TCP move to the
desired position relative to the sensors.
B. Calibration system setup

system, implemented and veriÞed by an ABB robot under
lab testing. This robotic system comprises of an ABB robot
controller (IRC5 Compact) and a six degree of freedom (6-
DOF) robot manipulator (IRB120).

Fig. 2. Calibration system schematic.
In Figure 2, the robot calibration system mainly consists of
a robot, a laser and camera Þxture; and our position sensitive
calibration device (PSCD). A laser pointer is mounted on
its Þxture and attached to the robot TCP; this is shown in
details in Figure 3 to the left. The laser beam is tuned to
align its orientation toward the X-axis of the TCP frame.
Two segmented PSDs are mounted on a portable custom-
built, high-precision Þxture. In theory segmented PSDs have
a higher resolution than 0:1mm and even under experimental
conditions, its resolution may reach approximately 2mm. The
location of the Þxture with respect to the workpiece frame
fDg is known, while its location with respect to the robot
base framefBg is unknown.
Fig. 3. Laser and camera Þxture along with our newly developed position
sensitive calibration device.
The calibration process, in Figure 2, is completed by
locating the TCP at four different positions (position 1-4).
While the laser pointer is located at position 1 and 2, the
laser beam should be aimed at the center of PSD1 and
reßected off the PSD1 surface in a direction toward the
center of PSD2. Similarly, the laser beam should be aligned
to the center of PSD2 and reßected off the PSD2 surface
in a direction toward the center of PSD1, while the laser
pointer is located at the position 3 and 4. Details on how to
control the robot to achieve such requirements are explained
in Section III. Therefore, four sets of robot joint angles can
be recorded. Based on the recorded joint angles and robot
forward kinematics, a calibration algorithm is developed.
III. ROBOT CONTROL METHOD
The robot control system is among the most crucial and
important elements of the proposed calibration system. Dur-
ing the calibration process the controller is required to move
the robot TCP to a centered position over one of the two
PSD sensors automatically. Afterwards, the reßection from
such PSD sensor must also be controlled to reach a centered
position of the other sensor. Indeed, it is a challenging
problem that must be overcome in order to make the entire
calibration system an automated and faster procedure.
In order to address the problem we used a blend of visual
and PSD-based servo controllers divided into 3 stages. All
stages are meant to control the same robotic system, the
difference will be the type of errors determined by different
feedback sources. In the Þrst stage, the robot TCP will
be controlled by image-based visual servo control. A good
introduction to this topic can be found in [10]. At this point
the control task will be limited to Þnd a rough approximation

of one of the two sensors as well as to determine the length
of the laser line using the method described in [12], as shown
below in Figure 4. The camera is mounted tilted towards the

laser spot to capture the image over the surface forming a
triangle. The depth d can be computed accurately using the
triangular relationship. After the laser pointer hits the active
area, the controller switches to the second stage using PSD-
based servo control for an accurate positioning. Once the
laser spot hits the center of the Þrst PSD, i.e. PSD1, then we
proceed to the third and Þnal stage. At this point, we should
have the laser line length information from the Þrst stage.
Therefore, we use it to modify the kinematic model of the
robot to be able to Þx the point found in the second stage.
Once this step is done, we can control only the orientation of
that Þxed point such that the reßection hit the center of the
second PSD (PSD2) without changing its position in PSD1.
At this stage, we used a similar approach to move it to the
center of PSD2 but this time controlling only orientation. A
block diagram of the entire process is shown in Figure 5.
Fig. 5. Robot control system block diagram.
Here R is the matrix to translate the errors given by the
PSD to those in the robot TCP and is computed online.
A. Image-Based Visual Servo Control
The Þrst stage of the controlled method is achieved by
using image-based visual servo control (IBVS). In a tradi-
tional IBVS system, the image jacobian is commonly used to
translate errors from the image feature velocity to the robot
TCP velocity [12]. i.e.

The commonly used control law is given by using the

where U is the control input and G a gain matrix.
B. Laser Line Length control
To avoid the well-known problem of singularity in the
image Jacobian, Equation (1) can be decomposed into its
rotational and translational components, i.e.
ú
f =J(u;v)w+J(u;v;z)v (4)
Therefore, we can completely decouple orientation from
translation control, i.e., no orientation control is performed
when translational control is conducted and vice versa. In the
case that only orientation control is conducted orientation is
denoted as;
w=GJ
 1
(u;v)
ú
f (5)
where
ú
f = f
d
 f represents the error of the LEDs features on
the image. However, during translation control the features
are the coordinates of the laser beam on over the image plane.
Based on height control, the coordinates of the laser beam
should not change and the errors are based on the coordinates
between the laser spot and the center of the two LEDs.
C. PSD-based Servo Control (Translational)
The second stage of the controlled method is achieved
by using PSD-based servo control. Similar to IBVS, the
image Jacobian is used to translate errors from the image
feature velocity to the robot TCP velocity. In this case, the
image is represented by the feedback acquired by the PSCD.
For instance, let us deÞne the homogeneous transformation
matrix of the base framefBg as
P
T
B
, which can be written
as;
P
T
B
=

R d


(6)
where R2å denotes the rotation matrix of the base frame
fBg relative to the PSD frame fPg. Similar to the way
we perform translation control in IBVS, the orientation will
remain constant. This fact implies that movements in the TCP
holding the laser pointer will be equals to those in the PSD
surface. Hence, we only need to get the velocity relationship
between both frames to be able to control the robot in the
task space coordinates.

Let the 3 components of both, the translational velocity
and angular velocity be represented by x ;

Because of the orientation remaining constant, i.e. move-

be represented by;

In order to control the TCP position error using the PSD

D. PSD-based Servo Control (Rotational)
The third stage of the controlled method is achieved by
using PSD-based servo control with rotational movements
over the point found on PSD1. In this case, the image is
represented by the feedback acquired by the PSD2. Because
we set the orientation previously based on measurements of
the PSCD, once we hit the center of PSD1 the reßection
should be somewhere in the active area of the second (no
IBVS required), very close to the origin as well. For instance,
let us deÞne the homogeneous transformation matrix of the
base framefBg as

Because of the position remaining constant, we can state that

IV. CALIBRATION SYSTEM APPROACH
The calibration system approach is one of the most crucial
components to achieve an accurate robot calibration. At this
stage, we are looking to use the robotÕs encoder information
after the controller stage is successfully done, to be able to
accurately determine the real TCP position. Nieves et al. [13]
introduces the algorithm derivations in more detail. There
are two main and separate ways to calibrate an industrial
robot, both equally useful in the calibration task, i.e. joint
offset calibration, and robot workpiece frame calibration. Yet
another advantage of our system is the ability to perform both
at the same time.
A. Analysis of the Kinematics Error Model
The Denavit-Hhartenberg [15] is a commonly used con-
vention to represent frame references in the forward kine-
matic model of a robot manipulator as follows,

transformation matrix associated with link i and joint i.

Note that joint 1 depends on the robot base frame. So in (28)
there are Þve unknown parameters, which are the last Þve
offsets d
i
(i= 2;3;4;5;6).
B. Joint Offset Calibration
Joint Offset Calibration is the process of calculating the
individual error contribution of robot joints, so that they can
be compensated later in the kinematic model.
In our proposed system, this process is accomplished by
locating the TCP and laser pointer several times at four
different locations. Therefore, four sets of joint angles can
be recorded by the robot controller. The main idea is to
Þnd a squared error for each two laser lines. Therefore, the
unknown parameters, i.e. the last offsets d
i
(i= 2;3;4;5;6),
are found by minimizing the total sum of squared errors, i.e.
Y=argmin

C. Robot Workpiece Frame Calibration
Robot Workpiece Frame Calibration is the process of
calculating the relationship between the robot base frame
and the robot workpiece frame, and it is usually in the form
of a transformation matrix so that the entire kinematic model
can be compensated later on.
LetR andt be the rotation matrix and the translation vector

V. SIMULATION AND EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
A. Robot Control Simulation Results
Simulations were performed using the kinematic model of
the ABB IRB 120 robot for the second and third stages only,
since the Þrst stage using IBVS was analyzed and discussed
in our previous work [12]. The mathematical model of the
6 DOF robot was used to simulate the dynamic movements
of the TCP based on the feedback generated by the virtual
PSCD. For the second stage of the controller, the simulation
results of PSD servo control (translational) demonstrated the
ability to track the position of the TCP relative to the PSD1
down to zero with a K
p
= 2 as shown in Figure 6 to the
left. Similarly, in Figure 6 to the right, the simulations show
stability as well as for the third stage of the controller using
orientation control over PSD2 while keeping position errors
over PSD1 equal to zero.

B. Robot control experimental results using IRB120 Robot
All three stages of the control system were successfully
tested and implemented using the PSCD and the IRB 120
robot. First, servo control was able to align the laser into
the active area of PSD1, as well as accurately compute the
laser line length (determined to be 494.269 mm for these
experiments). Figure 7 shows the image features of the two
LEDs along with the features of the laser spot. Figure 7
demonstrates the convergence between the center of the two
LEDs and the laser spot feature. The sampling time during
the servoing was found to be up to 100ms. The experimental
results found for the Þrst stage using IBVS control clearly
demonstrates that the laser beam can be guided towards the
active area of the PSD quickly and effectively.
Fig. 7. Image features before and after IBVS control.
In stage two, the PSD-based controller takes over and
proceeds to move the laser spot accurately into the center
of PSD1. This process will take approximately 15 seconds.
For the third stage, using the laser line length found during
the servo control process, the kinematic model of the robot
is modiÞed such that orientation control can be performed
around the point found in the center of PSD1. Then using
orientation control, we were able to not only Þnd accurately
the center of PSD2, but also able to maintain the original
position in PSD1. The exact same process will be repeated
three more times (for positions 2, 3 and 4) to complete the
calibration process. Figure 8 shows how PSD-based servo
control was able to reach the center of the PSD1 , and able
to reach the center of PSD2 afterwards without changing its
position in PSD1. The results achieved by these experiments
essentially veriÞed the feasibility of the control system and
the eventual automation of the entire calibration system
eliminating the need of human interaction.

VI. CONCLUSIONS
Robot calibration is widely used in the manufacture in-
dustry to enhance and achieve a higher level of accuracy
on industrial robots. We have proposed in the past a new
calibration system promising to be a fast, cost-effective, and
reliable calibration solution. However, to take the system to
the next level, and create an automated calibration process,
we created a control system capable of guiding the robotÕs
tool center point to a multi-position alignment. Simulations
of the proposed controller were performed and successfully
able to prove stability of the controlled system. The experi-
mental results achieved by this paper essentially veriÞed the
feasibility of the proposed control system providing proof
that the eventual automation of the entire calibration system
is possible. Further research on different types of controllers
is ongoing as well as experiments on the whole calibration
system performance.
