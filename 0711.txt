FBG-based Shape Sensing Tubes for Continuum Robots
Seok Chang Ryu, Member, IEEE and Pierre E. Dupont, Fellow, IEEE
Abstract— Fiber Bragg gratings (FBG)-based optical sensors
are a promising real-time technique for sensing the 3D curva-
ture of continuum robots. Existing implementations, however,
have relied on embedding optical ﬁbers in small-diameter metal
wires or needles. This paper proposes polymer tubes as an
alternative substrate for the ﬁbers. This approach separates
the sensors from the robot structural components while using
a minimal amount of the robot’s tool lumen and providing the
potential of inexpensive fabrication. Since the ﬁbers are stiffer
than the polymer substrate, however, design challenges arise
in modeling strain transfer between the ﬁbers and the tube
substrate. To investigate the potential of this approach, a strain
transfer model is derived and validated through simulation and
experiment.
I. INTRODUCTION
Continuum robots take the shape of three dimensional
curves and are able to change their shape through a com-
bination of bending, rotation and extension or contraction of
their structural components. Because of these capabilities,
continuum robots are ideally suited for applications such as
minimally invasive surgery. Their ﬂexibility, however, leads
to uncertainty in the shape of their backbone curve as well
as in the location of their tip.
Approaches to real-time sensing that have been studied
include imaging, electromagnetic (EM) tracking and force
sensing for tendon-based actuation. These techniques all have
shortcomings, however. For example, drawbacks with imag-
ing include limited resolution (ultrasound), risk of ionizing
radiation (x-ray or CT), and slow speed (MRI). Tendon
length-based shape estimation is limited to single bends and
its accuracy depends highly on the robot kinematic model.
In contrast to these approaches, a real-time sensing tech-
nology that could be easily inserted and removed from
the robot is preferred because of its direct measurement,
instant adaptability to the continuous shape change and
ease of replaceability. Curvature sensing using ﬁber Bragg
gratings (FBG) has received recent attention, due to its
small size, biocompatibility and high sensitivity. Compared
to EM sensors [1], FBG-based sensors are smaller, immune
to EM noise and can contain multiple sensors along the
length of a ﬁber. For example designs using attached [2]
or embedded [3], [4] ﬁbers have been implemented on 1mm
diameter metal wires. Both approaches reasonably assumed a
perfect strain transfer from the wire to FBG. While the small
wire diameter had minimal effect on structural stiffness and
made it possible to accommodate large curvatures (gratings

can tolerate 0.8% strain [5]), a solid wire sensor running
through the center of a robot’s lumen can interfere with the
insertion, removal and control of tip-mounted tools.
An alternative approach is to employ a tubular substrate
made of a low modulus material. Such a design would
use a minimal amount of the robot lumen and, despite a
larger diameter, its compliance in bending would tend not to
change the curvature of the robot into which it is inserted.
An additional beneﬁt of a compliant substrate is the strain
reduction experienced by embedded optical ﬁbers [6]. Using
this effect, a sensing tube can be designed to experience
larger bending strains than the optical ﬁbers could otherwise
tolerate.
A potential problem of a low-modulus homogeneous tubu-
lar substrate, however, is that compliance in bending is
accompanied by compliance in torsion. Thus, any twisting
of the sensing tube, arising either from sensor insertion or
from robot motion, would confound robot shape estimation
since the orientation of the sensors with respect to the cross
section would be unknown. This issue has been recognized
in the literature [7] and has been addressed using ﬁber
optic torsion sensing, although this has been limited to
large diameter devices due to the minimum ﬁber bending
radius [8], [9]. Twisted-core ﬁbers have also been developed
(http://lunainc.com/), which sense bending and twisting si-
multaneously.
An inexpensive alternative solution is to employ a compos-
ite material substrate that is compliant in bending and stiff in

torsion. Such tubular elements are commonly used in medical
devices, e.g., catheters and are composed of biocompatible
polymer with an embedded wire braid. With a high braid an-
gle, torsional rigidity is high while ﬂexural stiffness remains
low compared to that of the wire material [10]. Ovalization
and the resultant buckling are another concern in polymer
tube bending [11], but the resistance against it, called kink
resistance, is also increased with a high braid angle [12]. As
a result, the circular tube cross section is maintained even at
high curvature, facilitating sensor modeling. Finally, a metal
wire braid can be expected to reduce viscoelasticity in the
polymer substrate.
An additional beneﬁt of such a sensing tube is that it can
be integrated with various tools or device delivery systems
and not take up any additional area of the robot lumen. For
example, Fig. 1 (a) depicts 1mm diameter forceps that our
group uses with our concentric tube continuum robots. The
forceps are controlled by relative translation between a wire-
braided polymer tube and a wire running through the tube.
This shape-sensing and tool-actuation tube occupies a single
working channel and conforms to the continuum robot shape
(Fig. 1 (b)).
The contribution of this paper is to develop and vali-
date a mechanics-based model for these sensing systems
so as to identify the important design variables. Section II
presents the sensor design and reviews the related mechanics
literature. A model describing strain transfer between the
composite tube and the optical ﬁbers is derived in section III
and analyzed through simulation. Experimental results using
a sensor prototype are provided in section IV and conclusions
appear in section V .
II. SENSOR DESIGN
As shown in Fig. 2, the design considered here utilizes
three surface mounted optical ﬁbers. Although not considered
here, an alternative design could embed the ﬁbers in the
tube cross section. Multiple sensing locations, distributed
along the tube, are used to estimate the bending curvature at
discrete values of arc length. From these values, the shape
of the backbone curve can be reconstructed as in [13].

To provide a sense of scale, the dimensions of the prototype
considered later in the paper are provided here. The tube,
composed of wire-braided (SS-304V) polymer, has an outer
diameter of 1.05mm and an inner diameter of 0.75mm. The
optical ﬁbers have 125mm and 80mm coating and cladding
diameters.
A. Curvature-Strain Model
Shape estimation starts from the local curvature calcula-
tion using the measured ﬁber strains. In [4], a simple linear
model was used to relate ﬁber strain and the curvature based
on beam mechanics, but the coefﬁcients were calibration-
based rather than model-based. Thermal strains were com-
pensated in the same way. Improved linear curvature-strain
models providing better understanding of the mechanics were
developed in [2], [13], in which the coefﬁcient was the
ﬁber distance from the neutral axis. Also thermal strains
were included in the analytical model and compensated by
assuming uniformity of the cross section.
In contrast, the composite polymer substrate presents two
complicating factors owing to its susceptibility to axial load-
ing and its non-unity strain transfer ratio. These phenomena
were negligible for prior metal wire sensors because of their
high elastic modulus. These factors can be incorporated into
the model of [13] by introducing the strain transfer ratio from
the tube surface to the ﬁber, h, and the axial strain, e

In Eq. 1, h is only applied to the mechanically induced
strains, which is reasonable by assuming negligible thermal
expansion, because thermal strain is not an actual strain, but
temperature-induced changes in optical properties like the
refractive index of gratings [14]. Also e

of h. Compared to perfect strain transfer with h = 1, the
sensing tube can undergo up to

 1 times larger curvature
for a given tensile strength of FBG and sensor size.
In order to solve for the magnitude of curvature, k, using
Eq. 4 and Eq. 5, the value of h is needed. Although a simple
calibration technique could be used to estimate its value for
a particular sensor, a mechanics-based model will provide
design insights into the most important variables relating to
its value. In this way, it can be possible to select design
parameters to trade off maximum curvature versus sensitivity
to meet desired performance speciﬁcations.
B. Strain Transfer Reduction Effects
As shown in Fig. 4 (b), h < 1 is caused by two strain
reduction effects: the shearing effect in the soft interlayer and
the ﬁber reinforcement effect on the low modulus substrate.
The ﬁrst is related to the shear deformation in the adhesive
and in the ﬁber coating. This effect has been studied using
shear-lag models for embedded ﬁbers [6], assuming that the
layers only carry pure shear stress when they (at most, a few
GPa) are much softer than the silica glass (72 GPa) used for
the ﬁber core and cladding. Although this shear-lag model
does not consider transverse shear stress causing bending
deformation, the insensitivity of the FBG to this stress allows
its reasonable use for sensing tube bending.
For surface bonded ﬁbers, a modiﬁed shear-lag model
was developed in which the component of h due to shear
lag, h
SL
, is dominated by the ﬁber bonding length and the
bottom adhesive thickness while insensitive to the side or
top adhesive [15]. This analytical model, however, assumed
an unrealistic axisymmetry for the adhesive. In [16], this
axisymmetry was discarded, however, a simpliﬁed model
geometry was assumed in which the substrate had a sig-
niﬁcantly larger cross section than the ﬁber, an assumption
unsuitable for thin polymer tubes.
In addition, these shear-lag models in ﬁbers assume a uni-
form strain applied to the long bonded ﬁbers [15] or require
the strain proﬁle in order to obtain the ﬁber strain [16], which
is not feasible for a sensing tube experiencing a tortuous
curve along a ﬁxed ﬁber length.

The second strain reduction effect is due to the high
modulus glass ﬁbers acting as reinforcing elements for the
soft substrate. The resulting bending strain experienced by
the substrate is reduced by De
s
from the expected strain
without ﬁbers, e
e
. This reinforcement effect on a low mod-
ulus substrate has been studied in both surface bonded and
embedded strain gauges [17], where the interfacial surface
shear stress was transferred into the normal stress in a semi-
inﬁnite substrate.
For ﬁber optic sensors with a relatively long bonding
length, the h due to the ﬁber reinforcement effect, h
FR
,
was obtained using simple composite theory [16], which is,
however, based on an assumption of equivalent strains for
all components. Values of h estimated with this model were
consistently less than the experimental results, though the
causes were not discussed.
These works do provide, however, a starting point for
developing a strain transfer model for the proposed sensing
tube as derived in the next section. Following [15], both top
and side adhesives can be neglected. An analytical model for
a surface bonded ﬁber can then be formulated assuming a
circular glass ﬁber with a bottom half soft coating, a bottom
adhesive layer and a relatively ﬂat polymer tube substrate
(the white-dashed region in Fig. 4 (a)). Using symmetry, half
the length of an FBG sensor can be considered (Fig. 4 (b)).
III. STRAIN TRANSFER MODEL
The strain transfer model is comprised of an interfacial
shear model and a ﬁber reinforcement model. For modeling
shear lag, axisymmetry is only applied within the thin ﬁber
coating and the circular geometry between the coating and

To demonstrate the value of the model, the effects of
adhesive thickness, i.e., h

on h are studied.
In addition, interfacial shear stress is estimated for different
values ofe

for the simulation are summarized in Table. II.
As shown in Fig. 5 (a) and (b), h
SL
is approximately
unity in the given dimension, because the thin adhesive layer
results in a large a (Eq. 15), such that E
s
has a dominant
effect on h. Thus, in this dimension, it is reasonable to
assume the same h for all ﬁbers as in Eq. 1, regardless of
the adhesive amount. In each FBG, however, non-uniform
adhesive along the gratings can distort the spectral peak so
care should be taken to distribute adhesive evenly along the
length of each set of gratings.
A substrate with a modulus higher than 10 GPa transfers
more than 90% of its strain. Thus, in this range, low
sensitivity is not a concern. Instead, when larger curvature
measurements are required in a given sensor size, tube mod-
ulus should be modiﬁed rather than changing the adhesives.
According to [10], low modulus is obtainable by further
increasing the braid angle, by using a softer polymer, or
by using different wire materials such as Kevlar 49 ﬁbers
(112 GPa). For such softer sensors, differential sensing using
four orthogonally arranged ﬁbers as in [2] can be adopted
if necessary to double the sensitivity, though it increases its
ﬂexural rigidity as well as the cost.
It can also be seen that maximum t
a
and t
c
at q =p=2,
tend to be slightly reduced for a softer substrate, probably
due to the buffering effect (Fig. 5 (c)). They are expected
to be less than 5 MPa at both interfaces. The slopes of
t increase in proportion to (1 h
SL
)h
FR
as expected from
Eq. 14, 15 and 22.
This enables the use of a low shear strength (3-20 MPa
depending on adherence) super glue instead of a higher-
viscosity epoxy, the latter being more difﬁcult for micro-scale
fabrication. However, at larger diameters, epoxy is effective
when high strain transfer is necessary.

IV. EXPERIMENTS
A low-cost sensor prototype was constructed using one
FBG ﬁber and two identical ﬁbers without FBGs (Fig. 6) to
investigate the effect of the soft substrate on the curvature
estimation in single-plane bending. A 3D-printed ﬁber holder
with a curved triangular hole holds the ﬁbers (Technica
SA, Switzerland) and a wire braided Polyimide tube with
a braid angle of 62

(295-VI, MicroLumen, USA). The
longitudinal Young’s modulus of the tube was measured as
around 24.79 GPa, with an expected h 0:951.
Based on Sec. III-C, a medical device super glue (Loc-
tite 4013, Henkel, USA) was applied to slightly tensioned
straight ﬁbers. After curing, excess glue was carefully re-
moved using Acetone, to reduce ﬂexural rigidity and size. As
shown in Fig. 7 (a), the prototype smoothly passes through a
1.5mm circular hole so that D 1:4mm since its minimum,
D
o
+ 4r
c
, is 1.3mm. In this dimension, the effect of non-
uniform adhesive thickness on h, an expected manufacturing
error, is negligible as anticipated in Sec. III-C. This was
also supported by the sensor’s sharp spectral peak for all
curvatures, indicating sufﬁciently uniform adhesive along the
gratings

with an optical interrogator at 1 kHz (sm130, Micron Optics,
USA). In the process, the clearance between the grooves and
the sensing tube, necessary for the smooth rotation, can cause
calibration error.
As shown in Fig. 8 (a), for each groove with a ﬁxed
curvature, all e
g
, after axial and thermal strain compensation,
are plotted on a vertical line. The maximum and minimum
values in each line correspond to the maximum tension and
compression at the given curvature.
Although the results exhibit fair linearity and symmetry
in tension and compression, the h obtained from the linear
ﬁt of each set of the maxima (e
t
) and the minima (e
c
) is
slightly different from each other, i.e., 0.91 (h
t
) and 0.95
(h
c
), respectively. The mean (h
m
) is given by 0.93. While
these values are close to the expected value of 0.951, the
variation is large enough to produce signiﬁcant error in
curvature as shown in Fig. 8 (b).
To investigate the effect of curvature error on robot tip
position error, P
err
, and tip orientation error, O
err
, a robot
of constant curvature and length 80mm is assumed. This
length corresponds to the actively controlled portion of a
continuum robot used for intracardiac surgery [19]). At each
curvature, the FBG can measure strain either in tension or
in compression. Both cases acquired from the calibration
were considered, but the constant h
m
was used in curvature
estimation. The resulting tip errors are plotted in Fig. 9.

are considered sufﬁcient in most present
minimally invasive surgical applications [20]. In addition,
the other errors from the registration and organ or patient
movements are often much larger, so sensor improvement
over the requirements has little effect on the system accuracy.
Therefore, while these tip errors can likely be reduced
through improved fabrication and calibration processes, they
indicate that the proposed approach holds promise.
V. CONCLUSIONS
The proposed composite tubular shape sensor provides
sufﬁcient torsional rigidity and ﬂexural compliance through
the use of wire braid reinforcement. Additionally, this design
provides a spacious tool channel. As a ﬁrst step toward de-
veloping this concept, a mechanics-based model has been de-
rived to characterize the strain transfer between the compliant
tube and the stiff glass ﬁbers. This model incorporated both
the shear lag as well as the ﬁber reinforcement effects and
provides a means to identify the important design variables.
This approach was illustrated through model simulation and
a simple prototype was presented to validate the model. In
current research, manufacturing tolerances and calibration
procedures are being improved to improve sensor accuracy.
