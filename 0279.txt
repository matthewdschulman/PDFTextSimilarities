2
 stability 
guaranteed locally by the proposed anti-windup adaptive law 
for Euler–Lagrange systems with actuator saturation. All 
constant parameters of the robot system are estimated for an 
arbitrary target orbit. In order to achieve finite-gain L
2
 stability 
and ensure adaptive tracking performance, an output 
saturation function of the tracking error is introduced. The 
finite L
2
 gains are derived considering four actuator saturation 
cases, and finite-gain L
2
 stability is guaranteed locally based on 
passivity. The control performance is verified through 
numerical simulations using a two-link robot arm. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
ll plant systems consist of input limitations, so that the 
systems are protected from damage caused by over input 
or to limit actuator performance. Input restriction increases 
the windup phenomenon, which causes undesirable 
degradation of the control performance. Over the past decade, 
considerable research has been carried out on stabilization 
and controller design for linear systems with actuator 
saturation. However, a few studies have investigated adaptive 
tracking control considering input saturation for nonlinear 
Euler–Lagrange systems, even though robot systems are 
expected to achieve tracking control performance [1]-[5]. An 
adaptive proportional and derivative controller design 
method for robot manipulators was presented, and the 
asymptotic stability was described by Arimoto based on the 
concept of quasi-natural potential [6]. Based on passivity, an 
anti-windup adaptive tracking control method for non-linear 
Euler–Lagrange systems has been proposed by Kanamori [7]. 
In this method, although global asymptotic stability has been 
guaranteed, the input output stability or robustness has not 
been discussed. It is well known that passivity is applicable to 
finite-gain L
2
 stability [8], and the method proposed by 
Kanamori [7] is expected to extend to finite-gain L
2
 stability. 
In the present paper, finite-gain L
2
 stability is described for 
the anti-windup adaptive tracking control proposed by 
Kanamori for nonlinear Euler–Lagrange systems with 
actuator saturation. Some properties for finite-gain L
2
 
stability are listed. Using the proposed anti-windup adaptive 
law, all constant parameters of the robot system are estimated 
for an arbitrary target orbit, and based on the concept of 
quasi-natural potential, the output saturation function for the

tracking error is introduced [6]. The finite L
2
 gains are 
derived considering four actuator saturation cases, and 
finite-gain L
2
 stability is guaranteed locally based on 
passivity. The control performance of the proposed controller 
is demonstrated through numerical simulations using a 
two-link robot arm.

Assumption 2 and the following conditions are satisfied:

Adopt the anti-windup adaptive law shown in (44) through 
(48). Then, the system is finite-gain L
2
 stable. 
However, actuator saturation does not always occur in 
synchronization with the saturation case. When actuator 
saturation occurs independently on the other actuator, ? and 
µ are, respectively, given by (53) based on Property 7. The 
function matrix ) , , , (

non-diagonal, so that interference with each joint value of y 
arises. For the practical adaptive law, the following 
proposition is introduced.

IV. CONTROL PERFORMANCE 
The control performance is examined through numerical 
simulations using the two-link robot arm shown in Fig. 2. The 
details of the robot arm model have been described in  
Figure 2. Schematic diagram of the robot arm model 
 
Reference [5]. The target orbit of the arm tip is given by a 
circle having its origin ) , (
0 0
y x at (0.4 m, 0.6 m), a radius of 
0.1 m, and an angular velocity of π 2 rad/s. For the output 
saturation function ) (

stretched in the vertical direction, as shown in Fig. 2.

are satisfied for the case of no actuator saturation with the 
values of ? ?, ,

i.e., the windup phenomenon, so that the overshoot increases 
as shown in Fig. 4(b). As a result, the orbit of the arm tip 
degrades as shown in Fig. 5. In contrast, Figs. 6 and 7 show 
the simulation results using the proposed anti-windup 
adaptive law. As shown in Fig. 6(a), the windup effect is well 
restrained so that the overshoots are also restrained, as shown 
in Fig. 6(b), despite the disturbances. As a result, good 
control performance of the arm tip orbit is maintained, as 
shown in Fig. 7. 
V. CONCLUSIONS 
Local finite-gain L
2
 stability using the proposed anti-windup 
adaptive law has been presented based on passivity for 
adaptive PD tracking control. The effectiveness and validity 
of the control method have been verified through numerical 
simulations using a two-link robot arm.
