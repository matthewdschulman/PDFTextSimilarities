Abstract—The paper presents a novel 5 dofs (3T-2R) parallel 
mechanism. The mechanism is characterized by large 
singularity-free workspace and particularly large rotational 
capability which makes it suitable for 5 face-machining and 
similar applications. Having all its prismatic actuators along x 
direction, the x-motion is independent from other dofs-only 
limited by prismatic actuators’ strokes- constituting another 
major advantageous feature. Besides, an analytical direct 
geometric model can be easily established which is a rare 
feature in parallel robots. The paper introduces the novel 
mechanism with its inverse and direct geometric models as well 
as its kinematic models (forward and inverse Jacobians). Also, 
it discusses its singularity analysis and presents sample 
workspace plots evaluated based on isotropic performance 
regarding velocity and static force.       
I. INTRODUCTION 
To cope up with actual industrial needs, a research trend 
towards the synthesis of lower mobility parallel mechanisms 
has been noticed in the last decades. In fact, having a 5 dofs 
(3T-2R) mechanism is sufficient for the majority of 
industrial applications, such as machining, drilling, laser and 
water-jet cutting, etc. -even fewer number of dofs in others 
might be sufficient. These 5 dofs in general can be obtained 
either in one parallel architecture, via hybridization 
(parallel-series mechanisms), or through implementing 
right-hand left-hand paradigm.   
Hybridization [1-2] is not a recommendable choice as it 
increases the moving mass (due to having additional 
actuators on the platform) and thus impacting dynamical 
performance as well as the global precision and stiffness of 
the robot.   
On the other hand, right-hand left-hand paradigm might 
be more recommended and favored over hybridization, 
especially if 4 dofs are embedded in one parallel module 
(right-hand) and the remaining 1 dof is provided by separate 
left-hand mechanism: as for instance the suggested use of   
ARROW mechanism (3T-1R) studied in [3] with a turntable 
to provide the 2
nd
 rotational dof. Other machines already

exist such as the VERNE machine of [4] (parallel module 
(3T) + (2R) turntable (series)) and the SPKM 165 of [5] 
((2T-1R) parallel module + (1T-1R) table (series)). But 
unfortunately these [4-5] have rather limited workspace. In 
addition, such mechanisms are usually less flexible and 
might introduce challenges regarding control and motion 
planning. This is not to mention calibration related issues. 
Thus, in some applications the best solution would be to 
have 5 dofs (3T-2R) parallel mechanism as one structure.     
In literature, there are numerous synthesis and studies on 
5 dofs (3T-2R) robots such as in [6-10] and many others...   
However, most of these available mechanisms are either 
characterized by limited workspace especially regarding 
tilting capacity, presence of singularities, and/or complexity 
of design especially from manufacturability point of view. 
For example, although the regularity of the mechanisms in 
[6] is interesting simplifying their analyses, it unfortunately 
leads to reduced stiffness and precision as not all the 
kinematic chains cooperate in counteracting the load, and 
the precision along each axis is rather controlled by 
individual kinematic chain and individual actuator’s 
resolution. Besides, having prismatic joints along different 
directions reduces workspace and makes them less practical 
from industrial point of view. The mechanism in [8] 
provides 5 dofs (3T-2R) using redundant parallel module 
formed by two folding five-bar linkages set on two rotatable 
links and connected to the platform via universal joints and 
a 7
th
 actuator can be added in series to provide the 6
th
 dof 
(3
rd
 rotational dof) if needed. The direct geometrical model 
can be analytically derived which is interesting, but still the 
rotational capabilities and workspace are limited and 
dependent on position, not to mention that having the 
platform held by two universal joints is a drawback as the 
stiffness might be reduced. Regarding [9], the mechanism is 
undeniably interesting as it is characterized by large tilting 
capacity. This not to mention that having the actuators along 
one direction increases the workspace along this direction. 
Moreover, having an analytical forward geometric model is 
an additional bonus. But maybe the only drawback in this 
mechanism is the presence of cable-pulley or gear 
mechanism which can impact the robot’s performance 
regarding precision and stiffness.            
This paper presents a novel 5 dofs (3T-2R) parallel 
mechanism in the attempt to resolve the major problematics 
emphasized in the above argument. The mechanism in its 
current version implements rack-pinion sub-mechanism 
(which might indicate similar problems to [9]) to facilitate 
the study only, but this in fact can be replaced by any rigid 
linear-to-rotational motion transformation mechanism 
having no singularity in the required rotational range. Also,

compared to that suggested in [9], it has fewer actuators and 
hence lower costs (motors’ costs form a very large 
proportion of the overall robot’s cost). The mechanism is 
characterized by large workspace and tilting capacity, 
improved kinetostatic performance and relatively high 
expected dynamic capabilities.  The paper introduces the 
mechanism in (II) with its geometric parameters. The 
inverse geometric model (IGM) and direct geometric model 
(DGM) are established in sections (III) and (IV) 
respectively; while in section (V) the kinematic models and 
singularities are discussed.  Section (VI) then presents 
sample workspace plots evaluated using isotropic velocity 
and force based index (same as that used in [3]). The paper 
is concluded in section (VII) with conclusions and 
perspectives for future work.        
II. THE NEW MECHANISM AND ITS GEOMETRIC ELEMENTS 
 The graph diagram of the mechanism with a simplified 
functional CAD are shown in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2, respectively. 
Fig. 3 shows the dimensions of the platform and the two 
moving frames. The functioning of the mechanism is 
straightforward. Chains (III) through (V) cooperate to 
position the segment 
5 4
BB which is always vertical thanks 
to the constraining parallelograms (II) and (III); these 
parallelograms do not allow any rotation about any axis 
perpendicular to the z-axis of the base frame. Then, chains 
(I) and (II) together control the two rotational dofs 
z
? about 
the z-axis of the base frame and 
y
? about the y-axis of the 
frame 
? ?
f
M (tool frame). This is done thanks to the rack-
pinion mechanism shown in Fig.2-3, which by fixing the 
distance between 
12
BB ? with respect to parallelogram 
vertical axis ? ?
5 4
BB and rotating it controls the 1
st
 rotation 
(i.e. 
z
? ). As for 
y
? it is controlled by moving the rack 
which turns the pinion an angle proportional to the relative 
displacement between ? ?
45
B B and 
1
B . Thus, the TCP 
position and the tool orientation are controlled. 
  It is worth mentioning that we have used a rack-pinion 
here for simplicity of the analysis, but in general it can be 
replaced by any rigid linear-to-rotational motion 
transformation system having no singularities within the 
required range of rotation for 
y
? which is between -45° and 
+45°; this allows avoiding precision and stiffness problems 
due to backlashes in rack pinion mechanism as previously 
highlighted. The mechanism tilting capacities are between   
-90° and +90° regarding 
z
? and  between -45° and +45° 
regarding 
y
? which are enough for 5-face machining 
applications...Moreover, the x-motion is independent of the 
other dofs and only restricted by available stroke for the 
linear actuators. 
Regarding technical issues, it is worth mentioning that 
the limitation of commercial spherical joints can be 
overcome by replacing each with three concurrent 
perpendicular revolute joints. 
Finally, we introduce the geometric parameters of the 
mechanisms as follows:

respectively. Gray box signifies that the joint is actuated while

that the triple spherical joint shown in Fig. 2 (which is 
intended as simple clarifying CAD drawing) can also be 
replaced (practically) by double spherical joint or its 
equivalent (connecting the lower rods of parallelograms (III) 
and (IV) to platform) and a third spherical joint or universal 
joint for connecting chain (V) to the platform: so the 
technical difficulty of realization of a triple spherical joint 
can be overcome.

Fig. 3. 
III. THE INVERSE GEOMETRIC MODEL (IGM) 
After having defined the mechanism’s geometric 
elements, it is time to establish the IGM.  
The robot’s pose x is known, so we proceed by getting 
the points C and D (contact point between rack and 
pinion) as follows: 
 ??
f

C P RC (1)  
and 
 
p

where 
f
M
C , and 
p
r are known (refer to Fig. 3).  As we 
have now C , it is easy to get points 
35

3 3 3 4 4 5 5
, where  ? ? ? ? ? ?

It is important to recall here that point 
5
B is practically 
on the vertical line passing through 
4 3
BB ? but not 
coincident with them (to avoid collisions in practical case) 
as shown clearly in Fig. 2-3, but for simplifying the 
modelling we considered them coincident by compensating 
the real vertical offset in the z-ordinate of point 
5
A (as we 
already explained in the previous section). 
Now to get the point 
12

relation:

Hence, the IGM of the new mechanism has been

IV. THE DIRECT GEOMETRIC MODEL (DGM) 
The direct geometric model DGM is most often difficult 
to establish analytically for parallel robots. However, in our 
case it is quite simple. In fact, we have all the coordinates of 
points , 1...5
i
Ai ?? , so we get first the coordinates 
3 4 5
?? B B B , then 
12
? BB . Due to space limitation, we 
will describe it briefly. Consider the following system of 
equations:

Solving the intersection of the three spheres described by 
(9) , we get in general two possible solutions, call them 
1
3
s
B 
and 
2
3
s
B . Then, the z-ordinate of the point 
12
BB ? is known 
and it is given by (refer to Fig.3): 
 ? ?
1 2 3 b b b
z z z c b ? ? ? ? (10) 
Hence, we have two possible z-ordinates 
1

2

corresponding to 
1

Again, substituting  (10) in (11), we get in general two 
solutions corresponding to each value of 
1 b

11 12
11

ss

s
b
z ) and 
21 22
11
,
ss

(corresponding to 
2

four solutions, denote it by ? ?

satisfies the assembly mode (condition (7)) exists and as a 
result we have all the points , 1...5
i

the vector ? which is the projection of

The pose is then given by

T
zy
x y z?? ? x and 
the DGM is therefore established. 
V.       THE JACOBIANS  
In order to study singularities and evaluate the 
performance of the robot, we need to establish the Jacobian 
matrix J or the inverse Jacobian matrix 
m
J .   Thus, we 
need to get the relation between q and 
? ?
T
zy
x y z?? ? x where 
z
? and 
y
? are the 
angular velocities about the two perpendicular directions 
z
e 
and 
f
e (note that in this case geometric inverse and forward 
Jacobians are essentially the same as their corresponding 
analytical notions; for discussion on this matter refer to 
[11]).    
So, we proceed by differentiating (5) with respect to time 
to get:

 (25)  
So far, we have established the forward and inverse 
Jacobian matrices J and 
m
J , after establishing the matrices 
q
J and 
x
J . In what follows, we discuss the series and 
parallel type singularities of the mechanism at hand.  
A. Series Type Singularities 
Series-type singularity occurs when 
q
J becomes rank 
deficient i.e. when 
? ?
det 0 ?
q
J ; in such a case the end-
effector might be fixed ( ? x 0 ), but the actuators are 
capable of infinitesimal motion ( ? q 0 ). This means: 
 
? ? ? ?
T
det 0 1,...,5 ; 0

q x x
J n e n e (26) 
Relation (26) shows that series singularity occurs when 
there is a completely stretched arm (arm in the yz plane) 
which implies that singularity if exists (corresponding pose 
is accessible), it will be on the boundary of the 
geometrically accessible region and thus forms no problem. 
B. Parallel Type Singularities   
As for parallel-type singularities, these occur when the 
matrix 
x
J becomes rank deficient; in such a case the 
actuators can be fixed ( ? q 0 ), but still the end-effector is 
capable of infinitesimal motion ( ? x 0 ).   We will do linear 
operations on 
x
J to facilitate the study. The first operation 
is a change of the TCP to be confounded with C (this does 
not change the rank since it is mathematically described as 
adding linear combinations of some columns to a certain 
column)
(1)
, and thus we obtain the following matrix:

The matrix N (equivalently M and 
x
J ) is singular when 
any of the two matrices 
1
N or 
2
N is singular (rank 
deficient). The matrix 
1
N is of full rank as long as the three 
arms, namely (III), (IV) and (V), are not coplanar, which is 
guaranteed within the geometrically accessible space 
excluding its boundary. Actually, the matrix 
1
N 
(equivalently 
x
J ) may become rank deficient only in one 
case; this is when all the aforementioned arms are in one 
plane which cannot be -due to the  assembly mode 
(condition (7))- except the yz-plane and hence parallel-type 
singularity confounded with serial-type singularity which 
cannot occur except at boundary of the geometrically 
accessible workspace-provided that the corresponding  pose 
is geometrically accessible. Regarding the rank of 
2

computing and simplifying its determinant, we get:

possible except when both arms are in the yz-plane and thus 
a parallel-type singularity coincident with a series-type 
singularity. Again, such a situation cannot occur except on 
the boundary of the geometrically accessible workspace-if 
the corresponding pose is geometrically accessible in the 
first place. 
 
So, in brief, in this section we have proved that both types 
of singularities if to exist they are necessarily on the 
boundary of the geometrically accessible workspace-
provided that the corresponding poses are geometrically 
reachable-and thus form no problem. Also, any parallel-type 
singularity if present, it exists confounded with a series-type 
singularity. As a result, we guarantee the absence of 
singularities of all types within the geometrically accessible 
workspace excluding its boundary. 
VI. WORKSPACE ANALYSIS 
In this section, we present sample workspace analysis 
based on isotropic force-velocity performance index FVI 
introduced in [3] that the reader may refer to. The index is 
defined as follows: 
 min ,
ww
wl wl
vf
FVI
vf
??
?
??

 (31) 
The terms 
w
v and 
w
f are the worst speed and the worst 
force 
(2)
 respectively, whereas 
wl
v and 
wl
f are the desired 
lower bounds for the worst speed and worst force   
respectively. Actually, 
w
v is nothing except the largest 
isotropic speed (radius of the largest sphere included in the 
zonotope of the operational velocities), and 
w
f is similarly 
the largest isotropic force (radius of largest sphere included 
in the operational force zonotope (refer to footnote
 (2)
)). In 
case of non-redundant robot, the pseudo-inverse is replaced 
by the usual matrix inverse.  Actually, this index has been 
developed to overcome the loss of significance of singular 
values and based-upon indices (such as condition number, 
manipulability index, etc.) in case of redundant robots, but it 
is applicable to all types of robots and holds a concrete 
physical significance quantifying the maximal attainable

speed and maximal static force that can be supported by the 
end-effector regardless of direction. Furthermore, it serves 
as well as a singularity measure (closeness to singularity 
when 0 FVI? )
(3)
, although this latter significance is not 
our major concern or focus here as detailed analytical 
singularity analysis has been done in the previous section.   
Since we have mixed dofs (translation and rotation), it is 
mandatory to homogenize 
m
J using a suitable technique 
before evaluating the index at each pose. Then, we consider 
the homogeneous inverse Jacobian matrix 
1 ?

and its pseudo-inverse

inverse (i.e. the homogenized forward Jacobian

Matrix W is the weighing or homogenization matrix and it 
is chosen here to be

homogenization matrix is arbitrary with the condition that 
the weighing/homogenization matrix should assure that the 
initial (non-homogenized) and the corresponding 
homogenized matrices are of same rank where W is a 
square matrix: in our case we use the characteristic lengths 
technique). We then have:

value) has been associated with the corresponding ? ? , yz 
position.  We have done the study on homogenized inverse 
Jacobian matrix 
mw
J (see Fig. 4-5) and a study considering 
only translational motion by considering the translational 
parts 
(4)
 of 
m
J and J , called 
mp
J and 
p
J respectively, 
which is the most interesting for us (regarding translational 
speed capability and pure static force capacity: see Fig. 6-7) 
as former study on 
mw
J can change with the chosen 
homogenization matrix W and its only importance is 
mainly as singularity performance measure (there is no real 
physical significance of  studying the norm of 5 dimensional 
velocity vector composed by linear translation of a point and 
tangential velocity of another point with respect to the TCP; 
this is always the case when having mixed dofs irrespective 
of the index used).  Note that considering translational 
performances only implies redundancy (3 dofs (3T) and 5 
actuators, i.e. 
mp
J and 
p
J are not square matrices). Note 
that the case of studying translational motion only implies 
that the angular velocity is controlled to be zero and there 
are no torques applied on the platform-i.e. we only have 
pure forces at the TCP).  Also, it is worth mentioning that if 
singular values are significant regarding 
mw
J being a square 
matrix, singular values of 
mp
J and 
p
J are no more 
significant regarding output performance capabilities as 
explained in [12]. 
In all the plots, we have set 
max wl
vq ? and 
max wl
f ? ? as 
to compare the isotropic velocity and force output 
performances of the mechanism relative to the maximal 
performances in velocity and force of the individual actuator 
(all actuators are considered identical). Note also that in the 
figures, the red solid lines show the collision limits with the 
sliders’ planes, while the dashed black box is the projection 
of the robot’s frame on the yz plane. The red lines are offset 
from vertical black dashed lines by 
c
t in case of zero 
rotation and by 
l
t in case of full rotation.   
Finally, to conclude up the section, it is clear that the 
mechanism has large singularity-free workspace considering 
zero rotation and full rotational capabilities. As a matter of 
fact, if we consider the ratio of the yz accessible region 
(with or without rotation) to the area of the black dashed 
box-representing the frame of the robot, this ratio is clearly 
high.  
Besides, the kinetostatic performances are quite 
interesting (remember that these represent capabilities that 
can be achieved in all directions). It would even be more 
improved and its performance more enhanced after properly 
optimizing this mechanism which is not our concern here. 
Additionally, the workspace is convex; such convexity is 
important regarding trajectory planning where each two 
points can be joined by a straight line trajectory.

VII. CONCLUSION AND PERSPECTIVES 
In this paper, we have introduced a novel 5 dofs (3T-2R) 
parallel mechanism that has the following characteristics: 
? The functioning of the mechanism is simple.  
? It admits an analytical direct geometric model DGM that 
is a rare feature to find regarding parallel manipulators and 
can be very helpful regarding control issues. 
? It has independent motion along x-direction only 
restricted by available stroke for prismatic joints.  
? Parallel type singularities if to exist, they are coincident 
with series-type singularities and cannot occur except at the 
geometrically accessible workspace boundary (provided that 
corresponding poses are geometrically achievable). Thus, in 
any case they do not form any problem. 
? It has large singularity-free cross-sectional workspace 
with or without rotation. Also, its isotropic kinetostatic 
performance is quite interesting and it is expected to be 
improved even more after optimization. This has been 
clarified by the preliminary analysis of workspace for non-
optimized set of geometric parameters.   
? High stiffness having all the limbs sharing in the load 
support along all directions.  
? Having spherical joints at the arms’ extremities puts these 
arms under tension/compression forces which improves 
accuracy due to reduced deformation in the arms.  
It is important to mention that this mechanism is a 
starting point, as other versions based on this one and with 
better performance are being thought of and may be the 
subject for future publications. We also emphasize that in 
this mechanism, the use of rack-pinion is meant to simplify 
the modelling and the preliminary presentation of the 
mechanism, but in the realistic case it would be replaced by 
more rigid linear-to-rotational motion transformation 
mechanism.
