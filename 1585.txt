Abstract? This paper presents the development of a
lightweight origami-inspired foldable hexapod robot. Using a
single sheet of polyester and a laser cutter, the hexapod robot
can be fabricated and assembled in less than one hour from
scratch. No screw or other external tools are required for as-
sembly. The robot has built-in polyester fasteners considered in
its crease pattern. The design uses four-bar mechanisms, which
makes the robot exible to be adjusted for different speeds
or other task metrics. For a given desired locomotion velocity,
various parameters of the four-bar mechanisms in the crease
pattern can be modied accordingly. Design exibility, ease of
fabrication, and low cost make the robot suitable as an agent
for swarm objectives. This work presents the foldable hexapod
design and its kinematic analysis. The robot is fabricated,
assembled, and tested for functionality. Experimental results
show that the robot prototype runs with a maximum forward
speed of 5 body lengths per second and turns in place with
a speed of 1 revolution per second. The nal robot weighs 42
grams.
I. INTRODUCTION
The collective behavior of a dense group of objects moving
in large numbers is usually known as a swarm. Ants or
bees are examples of swarm in nature. The development of
a bio-inspired robotic swarm of ground robots is the main
motivation of this work, where the overall task will be robust
to operational failures of members. While agents can be
relatively simpler in a multi-robot setting, they still need to
satisfy low-level objectives such as locomotion and steering
on unstructured or rough terrain. This paper addresses the
design and fabrication of a mobile robot by folding a
single sheet of plastic based on origami concepts, capable
of maneuvering on rough terrain and suitable for rapid and
inexpensive production towards experimental many-robot
applications.
Legged robots offer a salient solution for maneuvering
on rough terrain. More specically, the hexapod mechanism
attracts attention due to its similarity to a variety of insects
and ability to negotiate unstructured terrain with a high
level of stability [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6]. In addition to
maneuverability, high-speed, low-cost, and straightforward
fabrication and operation of mobile robot agents plays a
signicant role for experimental many-robot systems of the
future. Hexapod robots such as those presented in [7],
[5], [6] that require considerable alignment and assembly
operations of many distinct parts are not optimal for these

applications. Promising results that utilize minimal Degrees
of Freedom (DOF) include DASH [8] and Kilobot [9]. DASH
is a lightweight and fast hexapod robot that is suitable for
locomotion on unstructured terrain. It utilizes the Smart
Composite Microstructure (SCM) process for fabrication,
which requires multi-layer alignment and a number of parts
that need to be assembled. On the other hand Kilobot is a
low-cost system developed for tabletop experimental multi-
robot studies that and not suitable for real environments.
Our objective in this research is to ll the gap between
robots like Kilobot and DASH by making a robot with
high maneuverability as well as easy and cost-effective
fabrication process. Here, we propose a new design of a
hexapod robot to satisfy these requirements while it is able
to walk in rough environment. For this purpose, we take
advantage of origami technique. It has been shown that
origami, the traditional Japanese art of paper folding, is a
reliable technique for fabricating robots by folding planar
sheets. Felton et.al [10], [11] used origami for self-folding of
shape memory composite, and Onal et.al showed an origami-
inspired approach to make worm robots [12].
In this paper, we use the same origami technique to make
our hexapod robot. Our robot is ?printed? by laser machining
a single polyester sheet [7] and then folded. Our printed
and folded hexapod robot is shown in Fig. 1. The presented
design in this paper does not use any external fasteners. All
fasteners are embedded in the crease pattern, which reduces
the assembly time. The robot is folded from a single sheet of
plastic. The presented hexapod in this paper uses only two
DC motors, the minimum number of actuators required for
2-D maneuverability with a differential drive controller. The
electronic control circuitry is custom fabricated as part of

body, which reduces the cost compared to using commercial
circuits. The presented hexapod weighs 42 g and is designed
to run based on the tripod gait as the fastest walking gait.
II. CONCEPTUAL DESIGN
In this section, the design considerations and requirements
of a hexapod robot for the proposed swarm application has
been explained. The discussion is followed by the details
of the conceptual design, which satises the required design
constraints.
A. Design Considerations
Hexapod robots have been used commonly because of
their innate balance and locomotion capability. To have
enough versatility and maneuverability over highly cluttered
terrain, the robot needs to have at least 18 active DOF, three
per leg, in its joint space. Having 18 actuators dramatically
increases the cost, weight, and size of the robot. This makes
an 18-DOF robot an inefcient agent for swarm applications.
A possible solution is to reduce the cost of each robot
by reducing the number of actuators. However, reducing
the number of active DOF of the robot will reduce its
maneuverability and workspace. For our swarm objective, the
robot needs to have capability to walk, turn, and maneuver
over rough terrain. To satisfy this need, a minimum of two
actuators is required, one for each side of the robot body.
This conguration will allow the hexapod robot to benet
from a differential drive locomotion system.
The other design requirement is to keep the weight of the
robot as low as possible. While reducing the number of the
actuators will reduce the weight of the robot, it is possible
to further reduce the weight by using a lightweight material.
The material used should be invulnerable to collisions. To
satisfy this need, the main body of the robot is formed by
Fig. 3. The proposed design of a 2-DOF hexapod mobile robot.
folding a polyester sheet. Since the manufacturing process
includes only laser cutting and folding the polyester, the
manufacturing cost is minimal.
B. Proposed Design
The designed robot is conducted by a main body to which
two extended four-bar mechanisms are attached. The robot is
considered to be longitudinally symmetric and it is designed
to walk based on tripod gait.
Let's dene legs of the robot as follows: Front Left (FL),
Middle Left (ML), Rear Left (RL), Front Right (FR), Middle
Right (MR), and Rear Right (RR). All three left legs (FL,
ML, and RL) are part of the same mechanism which is
achieved by extending a single four-bar as will be discussed
later. In the same way, all three right legs (FR, MR, and
RR) are part of another four-bar mechanism with the same
design as the left one. When the left four-bar mechanism
works, legs FL and RL have 180-degree phase difference
with the leg ML. On the other side of the robot, legs FR
and RR have 180 degrees phase difference with the leg MR.
All we need to do to have a tripod gait is to keep a 180-
degree phase difference between the left and right four-bar
mechanisms. In this way legs FL, MR, and RL will be in the
same phase, and legs FR, ML, and RR will be in the same
phase as well but with 180 degrees phase difference with the
other legs. This enables the robot to walk using a tripod gait,
which is the fastest locomotion gait possible for a hexapod
mobile robot. The design and parameters are shown in Fig.
2 and Fig. 3. As shown, Fig. 3 is a simplied version of
its general design depicted in Fig. 2. However, the presented
analysis will retain its generality.
As shown in Fig. 2, the design starts with a simple four-
bar mechanism 1-2-3-4 with the grounded link of 1-4. The
link 3-4 is then extended to create the front leg and the link
2-3 is extended to create the middle leg. For the rear leg,
as we discussed, we need it to be in the same phase as the
front leg. Therefore, a parallelogram is created to achieve this
goal. The exact same mechanism is designed for the other
2972
side of the robot.
III. KINEMATIC ANALYSIS AND DESIGN
OPTIMIZATION
Our nal design for the four-bar based hexapod mobile
robot is developed as a result of an optimization process to
maximize the running speed of the robot.
A. Full Kinematic Analysis
As shown in Fig. 2, the kinematics of the mechanism used
for each side of the robot is governed by the central crank-
rocker mechanism as depicted in Fig. 3. The analysis of this
four-bar mechanism is required for the robot's locomotion
analysis and gait optimization.

B. Design Optimization
In order to correct the gait sequence of the robot, the
proposed mechanism needs to be optimized. The main
objective of the optimization is to minimize the vibrations
introduced to the motion of the robot, by correcting the
direction of the velocity vectors of the active feet. The active
feet are dened as the link tips that are in contact with the
ground. A perfect gait sequence is achievable by having all
the velocities of the active feet in the same direction and
parallel to the body of the robot. However, imposing this
constraint on the optimization algorithm results in an empty
feasible space. This conclusion has been made by running
the optimization algorithm from ve-hundred different
random initial points. In order to bypass this problem, the
objective function is chosen to maximize distance traveled
along the body of the robot by the active feet. The details of
the optimization formulation are presented in what follows.

Since implementation of an optimization problem solver is
beyond the scope of this paper, available software packages
are used to solve this problem.
In this regard, two different optimization algorithms avail-
able in MATLAB software are considered: the gradient based
and genetic algorithm based optimization methods. Since
the system is highly nonlinear, it is obvious that the values
obtained for the design variables might not be the global
optimal solution of the system. To address this issue, the
optimization code is evaluated from different initial values
and the solution that yields the minimum cost function is
chosen as the nal solution of the system. The minimization
of the cost function and the nal cost value are depicted in
Fig. 4.

the velocity of the front and rear feet and the velocity of
the middle foot is illustrated by green color. As discussed
before, since there are no constraints on the direction of the
velocities, there are some instances that the active foot has a
velocity in the opposite direction of the robots movement
(i.e. negative velocities in the case of Fig. 6). Although
the lack of constraints on the velocities of each feet will
introduce vibrations on the movement of the robot, the
overall movement in a specic direction is guaranteed with
the chosen objective function. As depicted in Fig. 6, the total
integral of the active feet is considerably larger than zero
which will cause a net displacement in the forward direction.
IV. FABRICATION AND EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
As shown in Fig. 7, our robot is made out of one single
sheet of plastic. The black lines in the crease pattern need
to be cut and red dashed lines are folding lines.
At the beginning, a side view of the hexapod is drawn
for reference. From the picture shown, a rectangle piece of
plastic with triangular beam on every side is used as the
base of the robot, which provides rigidity and stability. Six
legs of the robot are also triangular beams of 7 mm on each
side. Between two legs, we cut through only two sides of
the triangle and the uncut side keeps them connected. Such
mechanism provides a one degree of freedom exure joint
and thus acts as the connector between legs. Then the linkage
system we designed in the previous section can be realized.
We also develop a method to lock folded plastic together
because the plastic tends to return to its original shape after
being folded. Such a self-locking mechanism is achieved
by rst adding a trapezoid-shape key and a hole on the
corresponding place where we want to x the item on. Then,
following the crease pattern on the key, we can fold it into a
rectangle which can go through the hole. After that, we then
unfold the key to prevent it from coming off. After many
experiments, this method proves to be the most reliable and
force the folded plastic to stay in the desired shape.
The key and hole design not only allows us to avoid using
screws and nuts, but also leads to another design principle
to help us mount the motor and other potential discrete
electromechanical components on the robot using the plastic
as a holder. Three rectangles are folded into a box while one
of the rectangles has a hole in the middle. The motor then
is inserted in the box while the crank goes through the hole.
2974
This way, the motor is permanently mounted in its desired
position and the main body wont rotate.
Laser machining the entire crease pattern takes approx-
imately 5-6 minutes depending on the speed of the laser
cutter. When nished, the crease pattern becomes its own
blueprint such that almost everyone can follow the crease
pattern and fold the hexapod. On average, an experienced
researcher can build the hexapod within an hour. After
folding several robots, we nd that sometimes it is relatively
difcult to insert a small key in to the hole, so we try to add
a small triangle on the shorter side of the trapezoid which
greatly reduces the difculty of locking.
The main controller of the robot uses ATMEL ATtiny2313
microcontroller to control the applied voltage to the two
Permanent Magnet Brushed DC (PMBDC) motors that run
the cranks on the left and right side mechanisms. To do so,
The Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) signals generated by
microcontroller are fed into two H-bridges that are connected
to the terminals of the PMBDC motors. An Xbee module
is used to send wireless commands to the robot using
asynchronous serial communication. With the use of a small
lithium polymer battery (3.7 V , 160 mAh, 4 g) as the main
power source of the robot. The custom made Printed Circuit
Board (PCB) of the controller is etched using a simple solid
ink printer and an etching tank that contains Ferric Chloride
solvent. Although, for this prototype, the circuit is etched
from a separate plastic sheet laminated with copper, the
etching technique provides a unique method of creating the
circuit on the same sheet that forms the body of the robot.
The overall robot manufacturing time from scratch is
around, but less than an hour. The fabricated robot has a
ground clearance of 15 mm. A rubber cover is used on the
feet to provide extra friction during motion. We tested our
foldable hexapod robot prototype to validate its kinematic
functionality. We ran the robot many times in different
directions over various surfaces.
The robot achieved a maximum forward running velocity
of 5 body lengths per second. The speed of the robot was
observed to be uctuating between this maximum value
and lower speeds. From inspection, the reason was found
to be in variations in the phase difference between the leg
mechanisms on both sides. As mentioned before, maximum
locomotion speed can only be achieved when the two four-
bar mechanisms operate in opposite phase. In this case, the
robot runs based on the tripod gait with full speed. However,
because of errors in the gear motors driving the mechanisms,
this phase difference was not xed. The uctuation in the
motors varied the amount of phase difference between zero
and 180 degrees. Therefore, the average speed of the robot
can be considerably improved if the phase difference can be
controlled or kept constant at 180 degrees. Fig. 8 shows snap-
shots of the robot during a forward locomotion experiment
over a linear displacement of 1 body length.
Due to its differential steering mechanism, our foldable
hexapod prototype can achieve very tight turns. By running
the two four-bar mechanisms in opposite directions the robot
can readily turn in place. The in-place turning velocity of the

V. CONCLUSION
This paper presented the design and fabrication of a
42 g foldable hexapod robot made of a sheet of polyester
for swarm applications over rough terrain. The robot was
'printed' and folded in less than one hour from scratch. No
external fastener such as screws or other tools are used or
required during robot manufacturing. The robot has built-in
polyester fasteners considered in its crease pattern. Because
of the material used to fabricate the robot, it is robust against
collision.
The robot was constructed from two extended four-bar
2975
mechanisms which are connected to the sides of the main
body. The robot can be adjusted for different speeds simply
by controlling the speed of the motors. Two motors are used
to drive the four-bar mechanisms, one for each side. The
four-bar mechanisms in the crease pattern can be modied
to maneuver over different obstacles with different sizes.
Design exibility, ease of fabrication, and low price make
the robot suitable for swarm objectives. In this paper, The
kinematics of the robot was analyzed and the four-bar mech-
anisms were optimized for maximum velocity. Experimental
results showed that the foldable hexapod robot achieves a
forward running speed of 5 body length per second and in-
place turning speed of 1 revolution per second.
Future work includes overcoming the phase difference
between two motors to keep the foldable hexapod robot
operate at the optimal speed with minimal variation. Also,
a controller needs to be designed and utilized to get ac-
curate motions of the robot in any desired direction. After
these initial steps, future work will focus on experimental
swarm algorithms for collaborative control of many foldable
hexapod robots on unstructured terrain. Although we ran the
robot many times in different directions over various surfaces
including different ooring, the robot cannot traverse over
highly obstacles. The reason is that the ground clearance of
the robot is only 15 mm. The next version of the robot will
be considered to have larger ground clearance to overcome
this shortage.
