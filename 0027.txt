Modular Continuum Robotic Endoscope Design and Path Planning
Yi Chen, Jiahui Liang and Ian W. Hunter
Abstract— Robotic endoscopes have the potential to help
endoscopists position tools during procedures, to propel the
endoscope to the desired position, to automate functions and to
prevent perforations during procedures. This paper outlines the
modular architecture for a continuum robotic endoscope with
multiple bending segments along the length of the endoscope.
Each of the segments is modular, containing a set of actuation
motors that drive short cables in the continuum segments.
Each modular segment of the robot is 15 mm in diameter,
can turn 180 degrees and has a turning speed ranging from
35 to 250 degrees per second. The robot is composed of seven
of these modular segments, has 14 degrees of freedom, is 0.91 m
long and has a mass of 157 grams. The implementation for the
mechanical, electrical, and software design is described and
the robotic endoscope bending motions are sensed, simulated
and controlled using kinematic models. Lastly, path planning
trajectories of the endoscope segments are designed and coordi-
nated to help propel the robot forward in an uncoiling motion
and in a follow-the-leader fashion along a path that emulates
simpliﬁed turns in a colon. We show that the robotic endoscope
is able to exert less force on the walls of the colon emulation
path, enable automated insertion into the patient, and execute
colon wall avoidance and linear scanning motions not available
in conventional endoscopes.
I. INTRODUCTION
F
LEXIBLE endoscopy procedures such as colonoscopies
are important for diagnostic and therapeutic treatment
of colon cancer. Robotic endoscope designs can potentially
improve the ability of endoscopists to position the endoscope,
decrease the chance of perforation of the colon, and automate
functions so that procedures are easier to complete with a
single person. Most commercial endoscopes have a simple
bending tip that is driven with Bowden cables down the
endoscope body. Automating these systems can be difﬁcult
due to the reaction forces and frictional forces generated by
tension on the Bowden cables. For these reasons, developing
positioning or force output controllers for long cable drive
systems and tendon drives are still an ongoing ﬁeld of
research [1]. Several techniques for robotically actuating the
bending tip of an endoscope to avoid the use of long control
cables have also been developed including using electric
motors [2], [3], [4], shape memory alloys, pneumatics, and
other combined techniques [5].
When a colonoscopy is conducted, it is sometimes difﬁcult
to maneuver the endoscope to the end of the colon at the
cecum due to the shape of the colon, resulting in incomplete
colonoscopies. Some methods that could help improve this

process is the use of a crawling system [6], [7], [8], [9],
[10], or double-balloon actuation system [11] to move the
endoscope down the colon [12]. These strategies require
actively grabbing the walls of the colon and could potentially
cause abrasion. Snake-like robot designs [13], [14], [15],
[16] have also been considered for this application. While
snake-like robotic endoscopes use rigid motorized joints,
continuum bending robots have the advantage that they can
complete relatively large 180
?
radius bends with a single
actuator without producing many discrete corners. For the
same number of actuators, a continuum design can also be
longer allowing the whole length of the endoscope to be
populated with bending segments and not just the tip.
Some continuum endoscope designs, including Neoguide
[17], [18], have multiple bending points [19] along the length
which are driven by several sets of cables with actuators
located at the end. Because of the large number of cables
in multi-bend designs, the endoscope becomes thicker the
further away from the tip. Follow-the-leader designs [20],
[21] use a single set of cables to create several bends along
the length as the endoscope is advanced. These designs can
be used to avoid colon walls thereby minimizing abrasion.
However, these multi-bend and follow-the-leader designs
cannot readily increase the number of bending segments and
require complex drive systems at the proximal end.
Fig. 1. A modular multi-segment continuum robotic endoscope is shown
without the outer sheath. Here, seven segments are shown with an overall
length of 0.91 m. The design is easily extended by plugging in additional
bending segments. Each modular bending segment contains an electronics
daughterboard and motors that pull cables in order to turn each segment.

Unlike other multi-segment continuum robots [17], [22],
[23], [24] which use large actuators at the proximal end and
cannot be easily expanded in length, this paper proposes
a modular continuum robot design with multiple bending
segments, each containing its own actuation motors. Because
of the modular nature of the design with the actuation cables
enclosed in each segment, the system scales well lengthwise
and does not become thicker when more bending segments
are added. Our previous work has focused on designing the
actuation and sensing for a single robotic bending segment
at the tip, which eliminates long Bowden cables [2], [3], [4].
In this paper, we design a robot architecture with multiple
modular bending segments which communicate with each
other and are independently controlled to produce a long
hyper-redundant robotic endoscope, as shown in Fig. 1. We
generate kinematic models that can be used to visualize and
plan desired trajectories for the robot and we implement the
new design to verify our design principles. We then control
coordinated bending motions between the segments to help
move the endoscope along convoluted paths. This includes an
uncoiling motion used for inserting the robot into the body
and obtaining lateral scans of the colon walls as well as
a follow-the-leader motion that traverses a path emulating
the turns in a colon. We show that our modular robotic
endoscope is capable of exerting less force on the walls of
the colon emulation path than conventional endoscopes.
II. TRAJECTORY GENERATION FOR MODULAR
CONTINUUM ENDOSCOPES
For the robotic endoscope application, there are many
possible desirable motions that can be helpful during pro-
cedures, some of which include a follow-the-leader motion
for avoiding colon walls, an uncoiling motion for inserting
the endoscope into the body, a linear scanning motion, and
a rotary scanning motion for looking at surface features.
Each of these motions has a different set of constraints
which can be solved to determine the desired sequence
of waypoint commands to achieve a given trajectory. In
addition, kinematic modeling and simulation are useful for
path planning, robot control, as well as visualization of the
robot when it is out of view during a procedure.
A. Kinematic Modeling and Simulation
The kinematic model for a twist-restricted continuum
robot differs from the model for a non twist-restricted system
[4]. In order to simulate and plan paths for the robotic
endoscope, the three dimensional orientation of each turning
module in a bending segment is modeled in Matlab. Each
bending segment includes N = 11 turning modules where
N
odd
= 6 and N
even
= 5. The overall desired bend angles,
as deﬁned by a difference in control cable lengths from the
inside of a bend to the outside of a bend, for a single segment
m are deﬁned as ?
m

and ?
m
y
. Euler angles can be deﬁned
for the system shown in Fig. 2 as,

It is important to note that the cord length angles ?

and
?

(which could measured by bend sensors or encoders [4])
are not the same as the angles measured by the gyroscope
sensors used in the implementation of the robotic endoscope
outlined in this paper. In order to control the full three
dimensional rotation of each bending segment, the angles
integrated using gyroscope signals also need to be converted
to the Euler magnitude angles ?

. For a controller

B. Output Force and Endpoint Stiffness
The output force normal to the tip of a bending segment
can be used to determine the endpoint stiffness of each
bending segment of the robot. The output force normal to
the tip F
ext
is,
F
ext
=
?
L
s
F
in
e
???
?K?. (10)
The pull force of the motor F
in
is modiﬁed by the capstan
friction of the bending angle ? and the coefﬁcient of friction
?. The internal normal force from string tension is related to
the tangential string tension through the radius of curvature
of the bent segment ?/L
s
, which is a function of the length
of the bending segment L
s
. Lastly, the endoscope structural
stiffness K is included.
From this equation, it is clear that the output force normal
to the tip is zero when the bending angle is near zero.
Therefore, the endpoint stiffness near low bending angles
will be very small. When generating trajectories, conﬁgu-
rations that require perfectly straight angles are penalized.
Paths with many straight bending segments will also require
an additional straightening algorithm in order to achieve the
desired conﬁguration. The kinematic model can be used to
describe the location of each element and to coordinate path
planning while the tip force model provides insights on the
conﬁgurations with the lowest endpoint stiffness.
C. Uncoiling Path Planning
The uncoiling mode can be used to insert the robotic
endoscope into the body or move the endoscope for linear
scanning. Other robotic endoscope designs commonly use
a separate long linear actuator for this purpose [20] or a
separate extension or inchworm actuator. In our case, since
each segment is motorized, a coordinated uncoiling motion
can be used to insert the endoscope into the body following
a set of constraints. For planar motions,

with a simulation for M = 7 bending sections. The uncoiling order goes

The sum of all the turning angles for segments within the
uncoiling region M

must be equal to the ﬁnal desired
angles ?

and ?

. Note that 2πn multiples of ?

or ?

satisfy conﬁguration constraints but require more complex
3D rotations for uncoiling. In addition, the location of the

is shown in Fig. 3. By specifying a desired coil length L
d
,
it is possible to generate a set of waypoints for inserting the
robotic endoscope into the body without a separate insertion
actuator. There are many possible algorithms that can satisfy
the constraints. In this case, the algorithm we use choses
to sequentially uncoil the three segments closest to the exit
point. This algorithm uses the fewest number of actuators at
any one time to complete the desired task. In order to provide
a higher endpoint stiffness, the algorithm avoids bending
angles with magnitudes less than 7
?
.
D. Follow-the-Leader Path Planning
A follow-the-leader mode can be used to navigate the
inside of the colon by following a deﬁned set of bends
dictated by the lead bending segment. These bends are
then followed by all the subsequent segments when they
reach the same position. These bends may come from x-ray,
ﬂuoroscopy, ultrasound and other scans. Alternatively, the
bends can be deﬁned as the operators are working in real
time such that they can push the endoscope forward, choose
to turn the tip of the endoscope, and have all subsequent
bending sections follow the same turns.
The set of bends for the ﬁnal conﬁguration are deﬁned
such that ?

m

, where
each bending segment is L

long. Ideally, each desired
bend is large enough to accommodate two or more bending
segments to form a more continuous shape and to reduce
deviations from the desired shape. Next, a function is created
to interpolate between the desired bends for segments that
have entered the body L

right and from top to bottom with the shape of a colon highlighted in pink
for reference. Different parts of the colon, including the rectum, sigmoid,
descending, transverse, ascending, and cecum are labeled.
For regions outside the body, other algorithms like un-
coiling can be used or the controller can simply be turned
off. An interpolation function f(•) can be used to generate
intermediate waypoints. Linear interpolation works best for
angles with magnitudes less than 90
?
but will also work
moderately well for larger angles. More complex functions
which allow for overshoot to reduce overall positioning error
can also be used. In general, bending angles with magnitudes
less than 7
?
are avoided for two or more adjacent bending
segment in order to provide a higher endpoint stiffness.
A simpliﬁed path in Fig. 4 that emulates the turns in the
colon (excluding colon pleats and three dimensional bends)
shows four 90
?
bends with M = 7. The modular nature of
the bends creates conformation errors, here the maximum
deviation from the basic desired path is about 52 mm for a
total desired length of L
d
= 910 mm. This path planning
paradigm provides higher endpoint stiffness, is fast and easy
to compute and works for both previously deﬁned paths
as well as paths generated during the procedure. This path
planning method also has the beneﬁt of being able to modify
any of the bends during the procedure if the path constraints
happen to change, such as when the patient moves.
III. IMPLEMENTATION
The overall robotic endoscope design can be broken down
into several repeated segments as shown in Fig. 1. The
mechanical components, electronics, software and commu-
nications architecture are designed to be modular so that
the endoscope can be lengthened by plugging in additional
segments, each containing its own daughterboard, motors and
turning modules.
Fig. 5. a) The arrangement of the communication between the modular
boards is shown. b) The communication signal from the motherboard to
daughterboard m = 3 shows how the ID, commands and angles from the
previous board are sent.
A. Mechanical Design
Each continuum turning module houses monoﬁlament
cables that turn the assembly in ?
x
and ?
y
rotations. The
turning modules are constructed through a stereolithography
process using Accura SI-60 resin. These modules are con-
nected to each other on joints which allow for ?
x
and ?
y
rotations but not twisting motions. Through the center of
this assembly is a long, 4 mm diameter spring that serves as
the tool passage used for passing biopsy tools through the
endoscope and for providing a small restoring force.
The turning section is then connected to the motor module
which contain two 6 mm diameter motors geared at a ratio
of 1:136 and rotary to linear transmissions. Unlike previous
designs with lower gear ratios [3], the motors in this design
produce higher forces, are not back drivable, and can be
treated as angular displacement output devices up to the
stall force. Each motor controls one turning axis; rotating
the motor shaft in one direction tightens one control cable
which then rotates the continuum bending section in one
direction while rotating the motor in the opposing direction
rotates the bending section in the opposite direction. The
complex motor module design with the built in transmission
is manufactured using stereolithography and are 15 mm in
diameter by 35 mm long. Connectors are placed at the end
of the module for the tool passage as well as power and
communications wires.
The continuum bending sections and motor modules are
repeated to form a long hyper-redundant robot. Each 130 mm
long bending segment can bend by 180
?
. This robot can then
be covered with a polymer (e.g. black polyurethane) outer
coating to protect it from external contamination and water
during a procedure. The distal tip of the robotic endoscope
houses a camera and lighting system. The proximal end of
the robot is connected to a handle through which power and
communications signals are routed.
B. Electronics and Communications
The electronics architecture is composed of a motherboard
located at the outside of the robot and several daughter-
5396

single bending segment with motor voltage limited to 3V . The dotted line
serves as a guide for the eye.
boards, each of which is located on a motor module. The
motherboard provides power, USB communications with a
computer and an Arm Cortex M3 micro controller. The elec-
tronics design for the daughterboards are small 10? 20 mm
circuit boards that include an Arm Cortex M3 micro con-
troller, two H-bridge motor drivers, and an Invensense MPU-
6000 MEMS gyroscope and accelerometer.
The motherboard communicates with the daughterboards
using a serial peripheral interface with all the daughterboards
sharing the same output bus as shown in Fig. 5a. The
motherboard sends commands to each daughterboard sep-
arately using unique IDs and each daughterboard responds
by reporting angles integrated on the micro controller. To
prevent bus contention, the daughterboard outputs only turn
on when their unique IDs are called. The bending angle of
each section is determined by the difference between the
angles calculated on a module m and the module connected
to it m?1 as shown by Fig. 5b. Therefore, the motherboard
also supplies the angle data from modulem?1 to modulem.
The bend angles are then calculated and used for independent
closed loop angle control on each segment.
The camera board includes a Toshiba TCM8230MD cam-
era, micro controller and high speed video data serializer. The
video data are deserialized on the motherboard side, buffered
and sent via high speed USB to the computer. The computer
software and user interface controlling the commands to the
motherboard and daughterboards is written in C#.
IV. RESULTS
The performance of a single segment as well as the
performance of a chain of segments is investigated. The
paths generated for coordinated motions are implemented
and simulation data are compared with experimental results.
A video showing several coordinated motions including the
uncoiling motion and follow-the-leader motion is included
with the paper. Videos exhibiting other capabilities of the
robot including lateral scanning, two dimensional scanning,
grasping, and crawling are also shown.
A. Segment Dynamics
The static output force normal to the tip of a bending
segment as a function of bending angle is shown in Fig. 6.
Fig. 7. a) The closed loop response to a command in the ?x bending
axis is shown along with disturbance rejection capabilities. b) The voltage
output to the ?x motor is shown.
Fig. 8. The ability of the endoscope to lift its own weight is shown with the
gravity vector pointing downward. One unit is commanded to go to different
angles with zero to three additional units attached to it. The panel on the
left shows one additional unit attached (a total of two bending segments).
Five tests were conducted for each data point.
As predicted by Equation 10, when the bending angle is
near zero, the normal force output is very small leading
to a low endpoint stiffness when the bending segments are
straight. The maximum output force and endpoint stiffness
occurs near 25
?
to 30
?
. Based on this information, paths that
utilize angles larger than 7
?
in magnitude will have better
disturbance rejection and should therefore be used as a lower
limit for path planning algorithms.
A closed loop controller is generated to control the desired
?
x
and ?
y
rotations. The controller takes in proportional
and derivative gains, performs dead band compensation, and
converts the desired output voltage to a PWM signal that
is sent to the H-bridge motor controller. The closed loop
dynamics of one unloaded segment is shown in Fig. 7. The
segment is commanded to bend in 90
?
and then -90
?
and then
the bending segment is tapped to show disturbance rejection.
The 3V output limited slew rate of the module is 250
?
/s and
the angle control tolerance is set to 2
?
. The parasitic rotation
in the ?
y
axis is less than 7%.
The stiffness of the bending segments can also be mod-
ulated in this design. When the bending segment is straight
with motors off, the stiffness of the endoscope comes from
the spring that is used for the tool channel, stiffness of wires,
and stiffness of the rotating joints. This baseline stiffness is

The path was planned in Fig. 3. White circular obstacles were added for

between 3.0 and 4.1 mN/
?
. When the bending segment is
straight with motors on, the stiffness of the endoscope comes
from the stiffness of the monoﬁlament cables and the force
output of the motors and is between 9.0 and 12.9mN/
?
. The
maximum force output normal to the tip of a single bending
section at 3 V is approximately 0.6 N. Since each bending
segment has a mass of 22 g, each segment is capable of
lifting up to 2.7 times its own weight. Figure 8 shows how
gravity effects the ability of the module to rotate to different
angles. In this experiment, the base unit hangs freely with
gravity pointing down. It is then commanded to different
angles with zero to three additional units attached to the
end. The ﬁnal measured angle clearly shows that the effect of
lifting one additional unit is small. However, the endoscope
can only achieve 20 to 30 degrees of rotation with three units
of load (total of four bending segments).
B. Uncoiling Motion
The robot used for the coordinated motion experiments is
a seven bending segment robot that is 0.91 m long, has a
mass of 157 g, and has 14 degrees of freedom (2 degrees of
freedom per segment). For the experimental setups for the
coordinated paths, white circular obstacles and a metal table
that is covered with a thin teﬂon sheet to reduce friction is
used. Several large increment waypoints are set in order to
reduce the effect of static friction. Due to the mass of con-
joining segments, the robot’s bending speed is much slower
Fig. 10. a) Snapshots of the robot in follow-the-leader mode are shown
traversing a path planned in Fig. 4 that emulates the turns in the colon.
Different parts of the colon are highlighted in pink. White circular obstacles
were added for reference. b) Time series data of both the desired bending
angles (dotted lines) and measured closed loop bending angles (solid lines)
for each of the seven bending segments is shown.
than that of a single bending segment and the speed can
vary from 35
?
/s to 200
?
/s. Figure 9 shows the experimental
data from the uncoiling path planned earlier in Fig. 3 for
insertion into the body without using additional insertion
actuators. The desired angles are generally maintained by
the controllers on each module. However, external friction,
play in the modules, and the overall mass of the system
does prevent the robot from achieving all the desired angles
perfectly with errors that can be as large as 30 to 40
?
for units
near the proximal end. Despite missing the desired angle
at some waypoints, the robot eventually catches up to the
desired angle thereby achieving the desired conﬁguration.
In general, the robot does a good job of releasing from the
coiled state and the angular errors are less than 10
?
. After the
uncoiling state, the robot is not perfectly straight due to low
endpoint stiffness for angles near zero degrees. Therefore,
a straightening state is added which moves the bending
segments back and forth slightly to overcome friction.
C. Follow-the-Leader Motion
A simpliﬁed path that emulates the turns in a colon is also
tested for the follow-the-leader path planning algorithm. This
phantom is designed so that measurements of repeatability
5398
and contact forces can be made while conformation can
be clearly assessed and ﬁlmed. For these reasons, it does
not include tissue contact effects and gravity effects from
three dimensional bends. The robot is inserted by hand at
a constant speed. Because all bending segments not within
the ﬁeld of view are left uncontrolled, there are large errors
especially for units m = 1 and m = 2 for times less than
15 seconds in Fig. 10. The robot does a good job of replicated
the desired shape shown in Fig. 4 which is made up of four
turns each 90
?
in magnitude. The robot transmits much of
the insertion resistance down to the endoscope outside the
ﬁeld of view. However, when reaching the top right corner,
the robot rebounds off of the right side wall of the setup and
rubs against the top left wall slightly.
More rigid closed loop bending segments would transmit
more of the forces through the body of the robot and reduce
forces exerted on the side walls when the robot changes
direction. However, a lower stiffness actually improves the
ability of the robot to follow a constrained path, reducing
the path errors shown in Fig. 4 and preventing accidental
colon wall perforation. A comparison of forces exerted on
the walls of the setup are shown in Table I for a Olympus
CF-IBW conventional endoscope and the robotic endoscope.
Five different tests were conducted for each endoscope and
the maximum forces during those tests were collected from
each contact point. The means and standard deviations are
shown in the table. The maximum forces exerted on the walls
of the setup are measured when the endoscopes are allowed
to smoothly slide along all the walls. The forces exerted on
the walls of the setup are due to several factors including the
forces required to change the shape of the endoscope, forces
required to move the mass of the endoscope, and forces
due to friction. In general, the maximum forces occur at
the conformation shown in Fig. 11. The contributions to the
forces exerted on the wall at point A include the additional
mass of the endoscope as well as the additional forces from
sliding friction at points B and C. Therefore, the forces are
generally larger at point A than the other points.
The conventional endoscope exerts more force on the
external walls (at statistically signiﬁcant levels p-values ≤
4.5? 10
?5
) when attempting to reach the desired shape
because the body of the endoscope cannot make independent
bends. The conventional endoscope is stiffer requiring a
larger force to change the shape of the endoscope. The mass
of the conventional endoscope is also higher at 0.320 kg for
a length of 910 mm. These factors contribute to the higher
forces in Table I. The robotic endoscope can change shape
thereby virtually eliminating the forces required to change
its conformation. In some cases, the robotic endoscope does
not contact wall C. The robotic endoscope is also lighter,
reducing the forces exerted on the colon walls.
Repeatability data can also be obtained for these two
motions. It is important to note that the robotic endoscope
is designed to be ﬂexible (to avoid puncturing the colon
walls) and to operate in conjunction with a human operator’s
motions (such as insertion during a follow-the-leader path
Fig. 11. Conformation of a Olympus CF-IBW endoscope (left) and the
continuum robotic endoscope are shown. The normal forces exerted by the
endoscopes on the walls are measured at three points A, B and C.

plan), and therefore position repeatability is not paramount.
Here, test ﬁelds are designed to be relatively open and
prevent the robot from relying on walls for reducing the trial-
to-trial variation. Repeatability data for angle tracking from
gyroscope readings is shown in Table II. The steady state
tacking error from the desired path is collected from each
experiment and the average of all seven bending segments
across ﬁve independent tests is shown in the ﬁrst row. The
maximum error of each experiment is also shown along with
the inter-trial (or trial-to-trial) variation. This shows that the
angle tracking is typically 1 to 4 degrees with the follow-
the-leader path producing the largest angle tracking errors.
The corresponding positioning data from video data is
shown in Table III. Each experiment was completed ﬁve
times and the video data was overlapped. Four frames of
interest were chosen, similar to the four frames shown in
Figures 9 and 10. The maximum range of the tip and
body motions for those four frames are then measured. The
majority of the variation for the uncoiling motion occurs
towards the end of the uncoiling and is eventually corrected
by utilizing the straightening algorithm. The tip tends to
produce more position variation than any other point on
5399
the body. For the follow-the-leader motion, the majority of
the position variation is due to the operator insertion and
is highest at frame (iii). The typical position variation is
30 to 40 mm.
V. CONCLUSION
This paper outlines the design of a modular continuum
robotic endoscope design. Unlike previous work that used
large actuators at the proximal end of the endoscope [17],
this design is modular such that each bending segment has
its own set of actuators, micro controller, gyroscope and
motor drivers. These sections can be individually controlled
using our communications protocol to form a scalable robotic
endoscope design that does not require any large external ac-
tuators for insertion or for bending the continuum segments.
Kinematic modeling is performed for the turning modules
in each bending segment and two path planning algorithms
for uncoiling and follow-the-leader motions are outlined and
simulated. Paths were generated to penalize straight motions
in order to increase the endpoint stiffness of each desired
conﬁguration. The closed loop performance of the bending
segments is shown as well as the performance of the robot
using waypoints generated by the path planning algorithms.
There are many possible extensions for this hyper-
redundant modular continuum robotic endoscope design. Fu-
ture work includes the investigation of additional coordinated
motions that may be useful for physicians including a more
compact uncoiling algorithm, rotational scanning, grasping
and propulsion modes. In particular, three-dimensional paths
and more advanced phantoms that better simulate human
colons [9], [10] can be explored by employing a larger
number of bending segments. Additional effects such as
gravity, friction, tissue contact, and folds in the colon walls
will also be considered.
