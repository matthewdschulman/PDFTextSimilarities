dual-servo stages, it allows the reduction on the cost of both
hardware and control design workload. The compliant stage
is devised using leaf springs to achieve a large stroke. Strain

I. INTRODUCTION
Micro-/nanopositioning stage is a key device in precision
manipulation and assembly systems. Positioning resolution
and range are two fundamental performances for a micro-
/nanopositioning system. Owing to the limitation of sensor’s
capability, a higher positioning resolution is usually achieved
in a smaller motion range while a larger range is generat-
ed with a lower resolution. In practice, many applications
demand a micropositioning stage with both a large range
and a high resolution for executing diverse tasks. To cater
for such requirement, a dual-range positioning stage offers a
promising solution.
Conventionally, the dual-servo stage is employed to gener-
ate a micropositioning stage with dual ranges and resolutions
based on dual actuation. Such a dual-stage consists of a
coarse stage and a ﬁne stage, where the latter is mounted
on or nested in the former. While the coarse stage pro-
vides a large motion range with coarse resolution, the ﬁne
stage offers a smaller range with ﬁne resolution. For in-
stance, dual-servo stages using different actuation principles
(e.g., piezoelectric, electromagnetic) have been developed in
the literature [1]–[5]. In particular, ﬂexure-based compliant
stages have been intensively investigated owing to their
advantages in terms of no backlash, no friction, and vacuum
compatibility [6]–[9].
However, the major issue of a dual-servo stage arises
from the interference which is caused by the interaction

between the coarse and ﬁne stages. It has been shown that
the interaction behavior of a dual-servo stage can lead to
an unstable open-loop control system [10]. To attenuate the
unwanted interference, the approaches of mechanical design
and control design have been developed in the literature. For
instance, the interaction effect can be minimized by resorting
to an appropriate mechanical design [7]. In addition, the
interference may be alleviated by constructing a multiple-
input-multiple-output (MIMO) control system based on an
interference analysis [11], [12]. Even so, the employment of
two type of actuators complicates the mechanism design as
well as control design procedures.
The motivation of this paper is to devise a novel dual-range
and dual-resolution micropositioning stage using a single
drive in each working axis. Speciﬁcally, the conceptual de-
sign of a compliant stage with dual ranges and resolutions is
proposed based on a variable-stiffness compliant mechanism.
The mechanism is designed to exhibit different stiffnesses in
the small and large ranges, which are enabled by leaf ﬂexures
experiencing different magnitudes of bending deformations.
The large and small deformations are measured using re-
sistive strain sensors to offer ﬁne and coarse resolutions,
respectively. Rather than a dual-servo stage, the presented
technique allows the generation of a dual-range positioning
by resorting to a single actuator for each working axis. The
single-drive design eliminates the conventional interference
effect. Furthermore, it renders reduction on hardware cost
and stage design workload. The proof-of-concept design is
conﬁrmed by both simulation and experimental investigation-
s. The proposed dual-range stage has potential applications
in precision positioning situations, e.g., the scenarios which
require a ﬁne alignment and a coarse positioning in the
smaller and larger ranges, respectively.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. The
conceptual design of the dual-range, dual-resolution stage is
presented in Section II. The mechanical design of a ﬂexure-
based XY compliant stage is outlined in Section III. Section
IV reports a case study along with performance evaluation
of an XY stage through both analytical modeling and ﬁnite
element analysis (FEA) simulations. A fabricated prototype
stage is shown in Section V , where experimental studies are
carried out. Section VI summarizes this paper.

driven by a linear actuator through a compliant bearing with
stiffness K
1
. In addition, the platform M is ﬁxed through
another compliant bearing with stiffness K
2
. To obtain two
motion ranges for the platform M, a mover is connected to
the driving end of the actuator. The translation of the mover
is restricted by two stoppers which are mounted on the output
platform.
Once the actuator drives the platform M to translate
forward (see Fig. 1), both bearings K
1
and K
2
will be
compressed. The overall stiffness can be derived as:

After a driving distance D

, the mover translates over a
distance? (i.e., the clearance between the mover and stopper)
with respect to platform M, and it contacts the stopper. The
corresponding displacement X

of the output platform can
be calculated from the relationship:
K

which gives

Then, if the actuation continues in the forward direction,
only the bearingK

will be deformed since the deformation
of bearing K

is constrained by the forward stopper. Hence,
the overall stiffness of the mechanism becomes:
K

Suppose that a maximal driving distance D

is produced
by the actuator after the mover contacts the forward stopper.
The overall output displacement of platform M can be

Thus, the one-sided forward motion range of platform M
is divided into two ranges of [0, X

] and [X

, X

], which
are assumed to be smaller and larger ranges, respectively.
Similarly, the backward motion range of the output plat-
form is divided into two intervals by the backward stopper.
In the two ranges, the stiffnesses of the system are different.
The stage behaves as a variable stiffness mechanism.

Based on the foregoing design, the deformation of the
mechanism is only attributed to K

in the larger motion
range of [X

that of bearing K

It is known that strain sensors (e.g., strain gauge, piezore-
sistive sensor) can be employed to measure the displacement
of compliant mechanism indirectly by detecting the varying
strain of deformed material. If the same type of strain sensor
is adopted to measure two different deformations, the larger
the deformation, the larger the output signal. That is, a larger
deformation leads to a higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR),
i.e., higher measurement resolution.
Thus, using strain sensors, the deformation of bearing
K
1
can be monitored with a higher positioning resolution
in smaller motion range, and the deformation of bearing
K
2
can be measured with a lower resolution in the larger
range. By this, a micropositioning stage with dual-range and
dual-resolution is devised. Speciﬁcally, the higher and lower
resolutions are generated in the smaller and larger motion
ranges, respectively.
III. MECHANICAL DESIGN OF A COMPLIANT XY
MICROPOSITIONING STAGE
A dual-range, dual-resolution XY micropositioning stage
is designed as an illustration, which is shown in Fig. 2. The
leaf springs are adopted to obtain a large motion range of
the compliant stage.
Thex-axis motion is guided by bearingsx1 andx2, while
y-axis motion is produced by bearings y1 and y2. Owing to
a symmetric design, the positioning in x and y directions
2352
follow the same principle. The moverx1 is connected to the
driving end of actuator #1, and stopper x1 is formed by a
hole in the output platform. The bidirectional translations of
mover x1 are restricted by stopper x1.
Besides, the bearings x2 and y2 form a decoupled XY
stage, which ensures that the translational motion in x
(y) direction is independent of that in y (x) direction. As
compared with existing work [13], the XY stage exhibits a
modiﬁed ﬁxing scheme along with added bearings x1 and
x2 to achieve the current objective.
A. Stiffness Calculation
The equivalent stiffnesses of the two guiding bearings
in each working axis are calculated ﬁrst. The bearing x1
consists of four ﬁxed-guided ﬂexures, which experience the
identical deformations due to the identical dimensions. The
equivalent stiffness can be derived as follows [13].

respectively.
Considering that the bearing x2 is composed of six basic
modules of compound parallelogram ﬂexure, its stiffness can
be calculated below [13].

B. Motion Range Determination
Assume that the two motion ranges in each working axis
are [0,|R

1
|,|R

+R
2
|], respectively. To determine
the relationship between motion range R

the absolute deﬂection of bearing K

is derived as follows.
? =D

where D

Taking into account (3), the following equation holds.
D

Then, substituting (10) into (9), a fundamental operation
gives
R

K

? (11)
which means that the smaller range R
1
is governed by the
clearance ? as well as the stiffnesses K
1
and K
2
of the
two bearings. Thus, to generate a smaller motion range R
1
,
the clearance between mechanical mover and each stopper
should be designed as:
? =

The required input displacement from the actuator can be
obtained from (10):
D

. (13)
Meanwhile, to avoid plastic deformation of the ﬂexures,
the stress experienced by bearing #1 due to a deﬂection ?
should stay less than the yield stress ?

of the material.
Hence, the allowable maximum clearance can be computed:
?

To ensure the safety of the material, the one-sided smaller

As for the larger motion intervalR

the actuator is derived as:
D

Similarly, to guarantee the safety of the material, the
maximum allowable motion range of bearing x2 can be
calculated:

C. Motor Stroke and Driving Force Determination

Additionally, the stiffness of the stage should be sufﬁ-
ciently low so that it is able to be actuated by the VCM.
Assume that K

that K

that the maximum driving force ?

D. Sensor Design
Two sets of strain gauges are employed to measure the
displacements in the smaller and larger motion ranges of
the compliant stage. To enhance the signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR), the strain gauges are glued around the maximum-
stress positions of the leaf ﬂexures related to bearings x1
(y1) and x2 (y2), respectively, as depicted in Fig. 2.
The relationship (6) indicates that
?1
?2
=
K2
K1
. By selecting
K
1
< K
2
, the relation of ?

2
is obtained. Hence, in
the smaller motion range, the length change value of strain
gaugex1 (y1) is larger than that of gaugex2 (y2). Therefore,
a higher SNR is expected for the gauge x1 (y1). It follows
that gaugex1 (y1) achieves a better measurement resolution
than gauge x2 (y2).
Without loss of generation, assume that the stage output
displacement is measured by the strain gauge sensors through
quarter-Wheatstone bridge circuits. The bridge output volt-
age can be approximated as:
V
o
=

s
4R

where dR and R represent the change value and nominal
value of the gauge resistance.
The gauge factor is expressed as:
S =

?
(23)
where ? is the corresponding strain induced by the defor-
mation of the ﬂexure bearing. The strain ? is related to the
experienced stress ? by:
? =E? (24)
where E is the Young’s modulus of the material.
Moreover, the relationship between the stress? and guided
deﬂection ? of a leaf ﬂexure can be derived as:
? =

4I
(25)
where K = Ebh

moment of inertia of a leaf ﬂexure.
In view of the aforementioned equations, the relationship
between the circuit output voltageV

and the ﬂexure deﬂec-
tion can be derived:
?=

It is noticeable that the deﬂections of ﬂexures (?

and?

)
in bearing #1 and #2 are one-half and one-quarter of the
entire translation (?
1
and ?

) of the bearing, respectively.
In view of (6), the ratio of output voltages of the two strain

As a case study, an XY micropositioning stage is designed
to produce the smaller and larger motion ranges of R

2
= 2.0 mm, respectively. The VCM
provides the stroke of±5 mm and maximum driving force of
29.2 N. Table I shows the stage parameters, which allow the

guidelines. In addition, the designed parameters lead to the
output voltage ratio of
Vo1

of SNR of the two strain gauge sensors can be derived as
SNR1
SNR2
= 5.60. It means that the resolution in smaller range
has been improved by 5.60 times as compared with that in
larger motion range.
A. FEA Simulation Results
To verify the static performance of the designed stage,
static structural FEA simulations are carried out by applying
an input force to produce the smaller and larger motions,
respectively. For the smaller range, the deformation result
of FEA simulation is illustrated in Fig. 3. To generate a
motion range of±0.2 mm, the required driving displacement
is ±1.80 mm. Taking the FEA result as the benchmark, it
can be seen that the analytical model result (±1.71 mm) is
5.0% lower than that of FEA. Moreover, simulation results
reveal that the maximum translational range of each ﬂexure
in bearing x1 is ±2.02 mm. The discrepancy between the
analytical model and FEA is only 0.5%.
Concerning the larger motion range, FEA results indicate
that the maximum deﬂection of each ﬂexure of bearing x2
is±12.10 mm. As compared with FEA result, the analytical
model underestimates the larger motion range by 2.6%. In
order to generate a total motion range of±2.2 mm, the FEA
predicts that the required maximum driving force is 24.2 N.
The difference between the analytical and FEA results is 9%.
The above discrepancies are all less than 10%, which
mainly come from the assumption for the analytical models
by considering the bending deformations of the leaf ﬂexures

of the nonlinear modeling.
B. Dynamic Analysis Results
The modal analysis is performed to evaluate the dynamic
performance of the stage. The ﬁrst-two modes represent the
translations along the x- and y-axes with similar resonant
frequencies of 35.2 and 35.3 Hz, respectively. The third
resonant mode at 72.5 Hz is attributed to the in-plane
rotation of the stage output platform. It is found that the
third resonant frequency is more than twice higher than
the ﬁrst-two fundamental frequencies, which indicates robust
translations in the two working axes.
V. PROTOTYPE DEVELOPMENT AND EXPERIMENTAL
STUDY
In this section, a prototype XY micropositioning stage is
developed and its performance is veriﬁed through experimen-
tal studies.
A. Prototype Development
Fig. 4 shows a prototype XY stage which is fabricated
from Al-7075 alloy by the wire-electrical discharge machin-
ing process. The stage possesses a dimension of 240 mm
? 240 mm? 10 mm. Two VCMs (model: NCC04-10-005-
1A, from H2W Techniques, Inc.) are selected to provide the
maximum output force of 29.2 N and stroke of 10.2 mm.
Each VCM is driven by the NI-9263 analogy output module
through a VCM driver. The stage output displacements in
the smaller and large range are measured by strain gauges,
respectively. The strain gauges have a gauge factor of 2 and
nominal resistance of 350 Ω.
To measure the quarter-bridge circuit output, the NI-9945
quarter bridge completion accessory is used to complete
the 350 Ω sensor. The bridge output is acquired by using
the NI-9237 bridge input module, which provides a high
resolution of 24 bits. It can acquire the quarter-bridge signal
directly and produce a maximum voltage output of ±25
mV per volt of excitation voltage. For the calibration of
the strain sensors, two Keyence laser displacement sensors
are employed, which provide a resolution of 25 nm within
the measurement range of 20 mm. In addition, an NI cRIO-
9022 real-time controller combined with NI-9118 chassis is

adopted to implement the controller. LabVIEW software is
employed to implement a deterministic real-time control of
the micropositioning system with a sampling rate of 5 kHz.
B. Experimental Studies and Results
The static performances of the XY stage in both x- and
y-axes have been tested. Due to the similarity of the results
for the two axes, only the x-axis results are presented.
First, the two strain sensors are calibrated. By applying
a 0.1-Hz sinusoidal voltage signal with amplitude of 0.5 V
to the driver of VCM #1, the stage output position in x-
axis is measured by the laser sensor as shown in Fig. 5(a).
The output voltages of the two strain gauges are depicted
in Fig. 5(b). The strain gauge sensors are calibrated by
comparing their output voltages to the laser sensor output.
The outputs of the calibrated sensors are shown in Fig. 5(c),
which exhibits obviously that the output of sensor x2 is
noisier than that of sensor x1.
To quantify the resolutions of the two strain sensors, noise
analysis is carried out. In this work, the noise mainly comes
from the electric noise of the digital to analog converter.
With zero voltage input, the noises of the two strain sensors
have been recorded. It is found that the noises follow normal
distributions closely with standard deviations (?) of 1.625
?m and 8.517 ?m, respectively. In order to quantify the
noise level, the ? value is adopted as the sensor resolution
[14]. Then, the resolution ratio of the coarse and ﬁne sensors
is derived as 5.24, i.e., the resolution in the smaller stroke
has been improved by 5.24 times as compared with that
in larger motion stroke. It is found that the experimental
result is 6.4% lower than the analytical prediction of 5.6.
This discrepancy mainly arises from the fabrication errors
of the stage parameters, assembly errors of the VCM, and
installation errors of the strain gauges.
Second, the magnitude of the two motion ranges are tested
by applying a sinusoidal signal as shown in Fig. 6(a). The
output position measured by the two strain sensors are plotted
in Fig. 6(b). It is found that sensor x1 saturates in the
limits of the range [–220 ?m, 310 ?m], which represents

the smaller motion range of the stage. In the larger range of
[–1940 ?m, ?220 ?m] and [310 ?m, 2470 ?m], the output
displacement is measured by sensor x2 alone. The switch
between the ﬁne and coarse positioning can be realized by
monitoring the output displacements. It is found that the
smaller stroke is larger than the design objective of±0.2 mm.
In addition, the overall motion range [–1940 ?m, 2470 ?m]
is slightly larger than the design speciﬁcation of 4.4 mm.
Besides, the fact that both smaller and larger bidirectional
motion ranges are not exactly symmetric with respect to
zero is attributed to the manufacturing errors and the unequal
clearance between the mover and each side of the limiter.
Third, the dynamic performance of the stage is examined
by the frequency response method. Speciﬁcally, a swept-sine
signal with the amplitude of 0.03 V and frequency range of
1–500 Hz is applied to drive the VCM #1. The frequency
responses of the stage position output are shown in Fig. 7.
It is observed that all of the three sensors predict the ﬁrst
resonant frequency at 17.5 Hz. However, the experimental
result is lower than that assessed by FEA simulation. The
discrepancy mainly comes from the added mass of the
mover and moving coil of VCM, which is not considered
in FEA simulation. The resonant frequency can be enhanced
by reducing the mass of moving components, e.g., using a
hollow structure.
It is found that the ﬁne resolution of 1.625 ?m can only
be achieved in the smaller range around the home position
of the stage. Besides, in the limits of smaller range, a rapid
impact of the mover with stoppers may cause vibration of the
ﬂexure. As shown in the experimental results (see Fig. 6(b)),
the impact can be eliminated by commanding a lower speed
of the stage at the two limits. Other performance of the stage
will be tested in future studies.
VI. CONCLUSION
The design and veriﬁcation of a new XY compliant
micropositioning stage with dual ranges and dual resolutions
has been presented in this paper. Based on the concept
of variable stiffness, a ﬂexure-based stage is devised as
an example. Analytical models have been established to
predict the motion ranges, coarse/ﬁne resolution ratio as
well as driving force and stroke of the actuator, which have
been veriﬁed by ﬁnite element analysis and experimental

of producing dual motion ranges in each working axis and
the same type of strain gauge sensors is able to provide the
ﬁne and coarse resolutions in the small and large ranges,
respectively.
