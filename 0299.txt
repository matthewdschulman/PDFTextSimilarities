Abstract— A manipulator which enables noncontact control
of the position and attitude of an object on a plane by
controlling a ﬂuid ﬁeld is proposed. The manipulator comprises
2 boards with grid pattern arrangements of holes and a parallel
link robot which is capable of translational motion with 2
degrees of freedom and rotational motion with 1 degree of
freedom in a plane. Air jets are discharged from the grid
of holes. The direction of the air jets from the holes can
be controlled by changing the positional relationship of the
2 boards by means of the parallel link robot. This makes it
possible to form an air ﬂow with a unidirectional ﬂuid ﬁeld
or a vortex-like ﬂuid ﬁeld. When an object is placed in the
ﬂuid ﬁeld, translational motion and rotational motion of the
object are possible. If the position and attitude of the object
are photographed and calculated using high speed camera and
feedback control is performed, the position and attitude of the
object can be controlled. The structure of the manipulator and
the principle of control of the ﬂuid ﬁeld are described, and the
possibility of controlling the translational motion and rotational
motion of an object is demonstrated experimentally.
I. INTRODUCTION
In general, when a manipulator is used to manipulate an
object, the manipulator comes into physical contact with the
object. In virtually all cases, both the manipulator and the
object are solids. Technologies for manipulation of objects by
contact between solid bodies are widely used at production
sites and have made an important contribution to the progress
of industry. On the other hand, with the aim of improving
manipulation technology, techniques which realize manipu-
lation without contact between solids have been reported,
by methods utilizing air jets, electromagnetism, sonic wave,
and the like. If solids do not come into contact, problems
due to impact, wear, etc. can be alleviated, and will become
possible to apply robotic manipulation techniques of a wider
range of objects.
This paper proposes a technology for noncontact manip-
ulation of the position and attitude of an object on a plane,

focusing on air jets, which can be handled with comparative
ease and are capable of outputting comparatively large force.
Previously, a method for manipulating an object by applying
air jets from several points was proposed [1]-[3]. In this
case, it is assumed hypothetically that the air impinges on
the object at a point, as illustrated in Fig. 1(a). However,
an air jet spreads after discharge from a nozzle, and mutual
interference between air jets occurs when multiple jets are
used, making is difﬁcult to grasp the ﬂow of the air entirely.
It is thought that these problems can be alleviated if the
ﬂuid ﬁeld of air surrounding the object can be controlled,
as shown in Fig. 1(b), and as a result, the object can be
manipulated with greater precision. Therefore, in this paper, a
manipulator which makes it possible to control the ﬂuid ﬁeld
is proposed. The proposed manipulator comprises 2 boards
with grid pattern arrangements of openings and a parallel
link robot which enables translational motion with 2 degrees
of freedom and rotational motion with 1 degree of freedom
in a plane.
As a conventional method for manipulating objects by
using air, a noncontact method in which the translational
motion of a spherical object is controlled with 3 degrees of
freedom in space by an air jet discharged from a nozzle
whose direction can be manipulated freely was proposed
[4]. However, with that method, it is difﬁcult to control the
attitude of the object and manipulate the object in a plane.
Consequently, the applications in which it can be used are
different from the method proposed here. Although numerous
other methods of manipulating objects by using air have also
been reported, these are techniques for moving an object only
in a designated direction [5][6] and techniques for suction-
type transportation [7][8]. A technique which uses air jets
to give a sense of a virtual object has also been reported,
but this is not a technique for manipulating the motion of an
object [9].
Chapter II describes the structure of the 2 boards which
comprise the proposed manipulator and the principle of
operation in which translational motion and rotational motion
of an object is realized by blowing air from the holes
in those boards. The structure of a parallel link robot for
manipulating these boards and the overall structure of the
proposed manipulator are also described. Chapter III pro-
poses a control method for manipulating the translational
motion and rotational motion of an object by acquiring the
position and attitude of the object by high speed camera and
performing feedback control. Chapter IV describes a proto-
type manipulator which was actually fabricated. Chapter V
presents an experimental demonstration that control of the

II. STRUCTURE OF MANIPULATOR AND PRINCIPLE OF
OPERATION
The proposed manipulator which enables
translational/rotational motion of an object on a plane
comprises 2 boards and a parallel link robot. Section II-A
describes the conﬁguration of the 2 boards, II-B outlines
the principle of operation for translational/rotational motion
of an object, II-C discusses the parallel link robot, and II-D
describes the overall structure of the manipulator.
A. Structures of 2 boards
The structures of the 2 boards are shown in Fig. 2. Because
the lower board can be moved relative to the upper board, the
upper board is called the ”stationary board” and the lower
board is called the ”movable board.” The stationary board
has a grid pattern arrangement of truncated conical holes, and
the movable board has a similar arrangement of cylindrical
holes.
B. Principle of operation
As shown in Fig. 3, an object is placed on the stationary
board, and air jets are discharged from below. When there
is no deviation between the positions of the holes on the
2 boards, the airﬂow is perpendicular with respect to the
boards, as in Fig. 3(a). In this case, the object is lifted
slightly, but horizontal translational motion and rotational
motion do not occur. On the other hand, if the positions of the
board are offset, as shown in Fig. 3(b), the direction of the
airﬂow becomes inclined. In this case, the object receives
horizontal force, and translational motion and rotational
motion are realized by using this force.
When the movable board is moved translationally in the
direction of the arrow in Fig. 4(a) without rotation, the
direction of the airﬂow becomes unidirectional and the object
undergoes translational motion. However, if the movable
board is rotated as shown in Fig. 4(b), the airﬂow forms
a vortex, which causes rotational motion of the object.
C. Parallel link robot
The parallel link robot shown in Fig. 5(a) is used to
manipulate the movable board. This robot has 3 sliders that
move rectilinearly. The 3 sliders and the end-effector are

directions of the x- and y-axes and rotation of the effector
in the ? direction are possible by driving the sliders.
D. Overall structure
As illustrated in Fig. 5(b), the movable board is attached
to the end-effector, and the stationary board is ﬁxed. Based
on the principle of operation described in section II-B,
translational motion of an object in the directions of the
x- and y-axes and rotational motion in the ? direction are
realized by using the parallel link robot to manipulate the
movable board.
III. CONTROL METHOD
The ﬂow of control for controlling an object to a desired
position/attitudeP
d
is shown in Fig. 6. In section III-A, the
object is photographed with a high speed camera, and the
position/attitude P
o
of the object are calculated by image
processing. In section III-B, the position/attitude P
dm
to
which the movable board should be moved in order to
move the position/attitude P
o
of the object to the desired
position/attitude P
d
is determined. In section III-C, the
desired movement distance s

of the sliders for driving
the end-effector of the parallel link robot to the desired
position/attitudeP

is obtained by inverse kinematics. In

A. Image processing
The u and v axes of the image photographed by the high
speed camera are deﬁned as shown in Fig. 7. The size of
the image is deﬁned as (U,V), and the brightness of the
pixel at position (u,v) is deﬁned as I(u,v). Two markers
are attached to the object, and the position/attitude of the
objectP

] is calculated by recognition of those
markers on the image. The brightness of the pixel where the
markers are photographed is assumed to be larger than that
of the other pixels. At this time, the markers can be extracted
if the image is binarized by using a threshold value ?

andP

. For simplicity,
it is assumed that superposition of the operations in Fig. 4(a)
and (b) is materialized in the case of simultaneous transla-
tional motion and rotational motion of an object. That is, as-
suming that the component which causes translational motion
of the object isT = [x

which causes rotational motion isR = [x

the following Eq. (5) is assumed to hold.

Translational motion: Here, we will consider the method for
translational motion of an object. If translational movement
of the movable board is possible, as shown in Fig. 4(a), force
can be applied to an object in the translational direction.
Therefore, adapting the PD control law, the following two
Eqs. (6) and (7) were assumed for the desired position of
the movable board [x

Rotational motion: Here, we consider the method for
rotational motion of the object. If the movable board is
rotated around the center of an object as shown in Fig. 4(b),
a vortex will be generated, and torque can be applied to the
object. First, adapting the PD control law, the following Eq.

this operation is also accompanied by translational motion,
as illustrated in Fig. 8. At this time, the desired position
[x

by Eqs. (10) and (11).

Because two states are possible, two solutions exist, as shown

only one of these states is used and the number of solutions
for practical use is determined as one.
Desired movement distance of slider: Since the movable
board is ﬁxed to the end-effector, it moves with the effector.
In other words, the slider movement distance s

driving ball screws with motors. The rotation angle of the
motors is measured by a rotary encoder, and s

from the measured values. The voltage applied to the motor
that drives slider j is v

which is capable of translational motion with 2 degrees of
freedom and rotational motion with 1 degree of freedom in
a plane. The principle of operation was described, and a
control method was proposed. An experiment was performed,
demonstrating that the position/attitude of an object can be
controlled using a prototype of the manipulator.
