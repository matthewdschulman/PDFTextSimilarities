AbstractÑWe present the development of the gyroscopic-
balanced control of an autonomous bikebot. The bikebot is
an actively controlled bicycle-based robotic platform with a
gyro-balancer developed to study human dynamic postural
balance motor skills through unstable physical human-robot
interactions. We also present a dynamic model and analysis
for stationary bikebot. A nonlinear balancing controller is
designedtostabilizetheunderactuatedstationarybikebotonan
orbital trajectory around the unstable equilibrium point that
is coupled with another orbit of the actuated gyro-balancer.
We then demonstrate the analysis and control design with
experimental validations. Finally, we present a set of human
riding experiments to show how the bikebot can be used to
perturb and excite human sensorimotor feedback loop for
dynamic postural balance motor skills.
I. INTRODUCTION
Robotic systems have been introduced and used in biome-
chanics, neuroscience, and human movement science to
study human postural balance. Those mechanical systems
include one or two degree-of-freedom (DOF) moving plates
(e.g., [1]), or multi-DOF robotic platforms (e.g., [2]) for
testingdynamicposturography.However,fewroboticdevices
are designed to aim at studying or training the humanÕs
whole-body postural capability through unstable physical
human-robot interactions. We consider using the newly de-
veloped bikebot as a new means to examine a sensori-
motor theory for modeling and shaping postural balancing
and other functional whole-body motor activities. Although
studying physical interactions between the rider and the
passivebicycleisreportedinrecentyears[3]Ð[6],thebikebot
provides active perturbation to break riderÕs sensorimotor
feedback loop through actively controlled steering, velocity,
and balancing. In addition, compared to other motor skills
such as quiet stance [7], riding the bikebot requires the coor-
dinated controlofmulti-limbandbody movements following
the sensorimotor cues. Therefore, the bikebot offers a new
platform for studying human postural balance motor skills
through unstable physical human-robot interactions.
Bikebot is an actively controlled bicycle-based robot. Our
bikebot concept was inspired by the recent clinical studies

in [8], [9] that report promising results of treating postural
disorder and ParkinsonÕs disease patients through bicycle
riding. The bicycle-based rehabilitation device in [8] is a
stationary platform and does not have the capability for
dynamically sensing and perturbing human motor control
skills. Our previous works [4]Ð[6] introduce a non-intrusive
instrumented bicycle system and this type of instrumented
bicycles however cannot actively perturb human motion and
break the human neural control feedback loop. The bikebot
instead extends the capability of the instrumented bicycle
by modiÞed steering, driving and balancing mechanisms to
augment the riderÕs dynamic postural balance capability.
In this paper, we focus on the dynamic modeling, bal-
ance control for stationary bikebot system and present the
feasibility to study riderÕs balance control by using bikebot.
The dynamic model of the riderless gyro-balancer bicycle is
Þrst developed. We analyze the bikebot stationary dynamic
model and present a pair of coupled oscillating orbits for
the bikebot roll motion and a ßywheelÕs pivoting motion.
The balancing control design is then to regulate the bikebot
motions through the gyro-balancer to follow these orbital
trajectories. An energy shaping method is used to design
the orbital following controller. We present experiments
to demonstrate the balancing analysis and control design.
Finally, human riding experiments are presented to show
the feasibility of using bikebot to perturb and excite human
sensorimotor postural balance feedback mechanisms.
Besides thenew bikebot design anddemonstrating thefea-
sibility to perturb and excite human postural balance control,
additional contributions of this work are twofold. First, the
presented stationary bikebot dynamic model captures a class
ofunderactuatedroboticsystemsinwhichthecoupledeffects
between the actuated component (gyro-balancer) and the
underactuated component (bikebot roll motion) are through
force/torque and energy exchange. Following the modeling
analysis, we propose a coupled orbital following control
design to balance the bikebot. This design complements
the orbital stabilization approach in [10], [11] where virtual
displacementconstraints,ratherthanforce/torqueconstraints,
are introduced and used. Second, comparing with other
related work in which autonomous motorcycles or bicycles
are designed at a moving velocity [12]Ð[19], we have suc-
cessfully demonstrated a more challenging task to balance
the stationary bikebot on orbit at zero velocity. Moreover,
weanalyticallygiveanestimationofthedomainofattraction
under the control design.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.
We discuss the bikebot dynamic model in Section II. The
balancing control and analysis are presented in Section III.
Experiments are presented in Section IV and we Þnally

II. BIKEBOT DYNAMIC MODEL
Fig. 1(a) shows the bikebot developed at Rutgers Uni-
versity. The mechanical structure of the bikebot is built on
a mountain bicycle with signiÞcant modiÞcations. Both the
traction/braking and the steering functions are augmented to
allowahumanrider,anonboardcomputer,orbothtobalance
the unstable platform. A hub motor and a DC motor are
used for rear-wheel driving and front steering mechanism
control, respectively. The steering mechanism is modiÞed
such that the steering handlebar and the steering fork are
mechanical separated and independently controlled; see the
left sub-Þgure in Fig. 1(a). The rider turns the handlebar and
theonboardcontrollercanturnthelower-steeringmechanism
at a commanded steering angle. Same design is applied to
pedaling for control the bikebot moving velocity. To perturb
the riderÕs balancing torque, a single gimbal active controlled
gyro-balancer is mounted on the back rack of the bikebot as
shown in the right sub-Þgure in Fig. 1(a).
The bikebot is a three-part platform: a rear frame with the
gyro-balancer structure and rear wheel, the front wheel and
steering mechanism and the gyro-balance ßywheel. Fig. 2
shows a schematic of the bikebot kinematics. We assume
that the mass center W of the gyro-balancer is located at
the rotating axis and therefore, its translational velocity is
along the rear frame. We denote C
1
and C
2
as the front and
rear wheel contact points with the ground, respectively. As
showninFig.2,frame B(x,y,z) is setup on the rear frame
with its origin at C

. Without pitch motion, yaw angle ? and
roll angle ?
b
are used to capture bicycle motion and the unit
vector set of B is denoted as (i,j,k).

We have the following property with the proof given in

Property 1: For a given periodic proÞle x

(t) with period
T, the proÞle for the pivoting angle is also periodic with
period T.
With the results in Property 1, we design an orbital stabi-
lization control to synchronize the periodic motion between
the ßywheel pivoting (x
3
) and the bikebot roll motion (x
1
).
The balancing controller is designed by using the gyro-
balancer. To further simplify the controller design, from (6)

Remark 1: The form of (14) is seemingly similar to those
of virtual holonomic constraints in orbital stabilization of un-
deractuated mechanical systems in [10], [11]. However, the
relationships (14) are not the same as the virtual constraints
in [10], [11] because (14) is obtained through the system
dynamics (11) rather than by design. Moreover, (14) repre-
sents the torque balance relationship between the controlled
ßywheel pivoting and the underactuated bikebot roll motion,
while the virtual holonomic constraints in [10], [11] capture
the displacement relationships among the coordinates.
Once the bikebot roll motion follows orbit O

IV. EXPERIMENTS
The physical parameter values of the bikebot are obtained
experimentally and listed in Table I. A force/torque sensor
(from JR3 Inc.) is installed along the seat supporting rod to
measure the 3-axis hip-seat forces and torques; see Fig. 1(a).
Anoptical encoder isusedtomeasure thebicycle speed. One
IMU unit (model 800 from Motion Sense Inc.) is mounted to
the bicycle frame to obtain bicycle attitude estimation. For
human riding experiment, a second IMU is attached at the
back of the rider to measure the upper-body pose [6]; see
Fig. 1(b). The embedded system (NI cRIO 9082 real-time
system) samples and stores all sensor measurements and also
controls the motors at the frequency of 100 Hz.

We demonstrate the gyro-balancer-based control of the
stationary bikebot in experiments. The gyro-balancer-based
balancing controller (15) was implemented at constant ?
s
=
1080 rpm with well-tuned parameter b=1, k
1
=1.3 and
k
2
=1 and the bikebot was successfully balanced. Fig. 3
shows the experimental results. The bikebot roll angle is
shown in Fig. 3(a), the gyro-balancer ßywheel pivoting angle
is shown in Fig. 3(b) and the generated gyroscopic balancing
torque is shown in Fig. 3(c). Clearly, the trajectories of the
bikebot roll angle and the pivoting angle converge to the
orbits and are Þnally synchronized in a periodic motion. It is
also clear that under the gyro-balancer control constraint (7),
the bikebot can be balanced within a small range (i.e., 2-3
degs.) around the vertical position.
The synchronized motion between the bikebot roll and
ßywheel pivoting motions can be further observed from the
phase portraits shown in Fig. 4. Fig. 4(a) shows the phase
portrait of the bikebot roll motion, Fig. 4(b) of the ßywheel
pivoting motion and Fig. 4(c) is the domain of attraction
estimation (18) projected on the roll motion plane. The
results shown in these plots conÞrm the design of the orbital
stabilization design and also demonstrate that the controlled
bikebot motion is within the DOA estimate.
To demonstrate the feasibility of the use of the bikebot
to perturb the human motor control, we also conduct a set
of human riding experiments. A young male subject with
experienced bicycle riding skills rode the bikebot in outdoor
environment (Fig. 1(b)) with his regular riding style. Both a
straight-line riding (for a distance of 50 m) and a circular
riding(aboutaradiusof3m)wereconductedinexperiments.
The riding speeds were among 2-3 m/s range. After the

is clearly shown in these plots that under a perturbation, the
rider uses the steering as a motor control strategy to keep
balancing the unstable platform. The responses also conÞrm
the Òcounter-steeringÓ strategy (turning the steering toward
the same direction as falling trend), a bicycle-riding motor
skill that is obtained through training.

along a straight-line trajectory. Bottom: along a circular trajectory.
To further demonstrate that riders use steering, rather than
other motor strategies such as upper body motions, as an
effective strategy in the straight-line and circular riding,
we conduct riding experiments under randomly generated
torques. We compare the riding responses in these perturbed
experiments with proÞles obtained from normally riding
experiments without any disturbances. Fig. 6 shows the
comparison results of the rider-bikebot interactions under a
normal and a perturbed experiment. Fig. 6(a)-6(c) shows the
riderÕs steering angle responses, bikebot roll angle, and the
rider applied torque in the roll angle direction for straight-
line riding and Fig. 6(d)-6(f) shows the proÞles of the
same variables for circular riding experiments. The rider
responded to the random perturbation by actively turning
the handlebar and using steering to balance the platform in
experiments.Thisisclearlyobservedbythecomparisonwith
normal riding behavior shown in Fig. 6(a) and 6(d). On the
other hand, neither of the comparisons of the bikebot roll
angle proÞles shown in Fig. 6(b) and 6(e) nor rider applied
torques shown in Fig. 6(b) and 6(e) does clearly demonstrate
signiÞcant difference. These resultsand observations conÞrm
that the bikebot platform can be used to study dynamic
postural human motor skills.
V. CONCLUSION
We reported the development of the bikebot for studying
human dynamic postural balance motor control. The bikebot
was modiÞed from a bicycle platform to argument the riderÕs
capabilitywithactuatedsteering,drivingandbalancingcapa-
bilities. This paper presented a dynamic model of the bikebot
with a gyro-balancer actuator. A self-balancing control was
designed to stabilize the riderless, underactuated stationary
bikebot on motion orbits. The stability and the stable regions
were also obtained through analysis. We demonstrated the
controller design and analysis through experiments. Riding
experiments were also presented to demonstrate the feasi-
bility to use the bikebot platform to study and tune human
dynamic postural control.
