Abstract—Inthiswork,wepresentalow-cost,ﬂyingresearch
MAV, comparable to common quadcopter platforms. We pro-
pose a ﬂyer with only two moving parts (a rotor and a stator)
and a single actuator that is capable of hovering ﬂight without
active attitude control. The passive stability is analyzed and
reduced to two mechanisms that are a function of the relative
offset of the center of pressure and center of mass, the angular
momentum of rotor and stator and the differential lift of the
spinning elements. The design space over these parameters
is explored with a dozen models that are unstable and one
that is stable. Interestingly, the two stability mechanisms are
not compatible requiring opposing design emphasis. Passive
stability of this model is veriﬁed by Routh Hurwitz criterion, in
simulation and a physical prototype. The vehicle has the added
beneﬁts of low complexity and favorable size scaling compared
to other MAVs. The vehicle design guidelines derived from both
theory and experimentation are presented.
I. INTRODUCTION
Inthelasttwodecades,therehasbeenanincreasedinterest
in micro air vehicles (MAVs), particularly for surveillance
and reconnaissance, the exploration of hazardous or un-
reachable locations, and the transportation and delivery of
payloads. With the advent of higher density batteries, more
efﬁcient motors, and light-weight, high-strength materials,
MAVs have become more feasible.
These robotic air vehicles can hover and be arbitrarily
positioned in 3D space. Lowering the cost of MAVs to be a
commodityproductwouldallowlargenumberstobefeasible
and enable a new class of application. Large scale distributed
sensing could be used to aid in applications such as forestry,
airport or shopping mall security. Being low cost enables
uses that would not be otherwise considered. Individually,
lowcostandsimpleMAVswouldalsodemocratizetheuseof
these devices and ﬁt many consumer applications including
robotic information aids and personal assistants. Toys are the
initial growing market of these types of vehicles.
Thus the design goals of this work are foremost to
minimize cost and size for a ﬂying device capable of holding
an arbitrary position in space. A key characteristic of this
ﬂying device is passive stability. While many MAVs employ
active stability, passive stability will not only be more robust,
but will lower the cost of the control electronics.
A. Previous work
MAVs come in many forms, each with their own pros
and cons. The most common is the conventional helicopter

conﬁguration. This includes one main rotor, controlled with
a swashplate, and a vertical tailrotor, which requires two DC
motors and three servos. This is the most common platform
for groups that are not interested in designing their own
ﬂyer, and instead purchase a hobby device. They have been
used as scaling testbeds [1], camera tracking testbeds [2],
ﬂight control system platforms [3] [4] [5], and autonomous
acrobatic helicopter platforms [6], [7], [8].
Also common are coaxial helicopters. These include two
large horizontal rotors, axially aligned. Some also have
a third small horizontal tail for pitching. They are less
maneuverable than conventional helicopters, but are simpler
inconstructionandmorecompact.Althoughcommonamong
low end hobby ﬂyers, researchers tend to design their own
coaxial helicopters for the purpose of aircraft material re-
search [9] and scaling of rotorcraft [10], [11].
Quadrotors have been increasing in popularity with
the recent improvement in microelectromechanical systems
(MEMS) gyroscopes and accelerometers. Unlike conven-
tional and coaxial helicopters quadrotors are typically ac-
tively stabilized, thus requiring sensors like MEMS gyro-
scopes and accelerometers. The complex controls are coun-
tered by a very simple mechanical design. By deﬁnition,
quadrotors have four continuous rotation motors with hori-
zontal propellers aligned symmetrically and equidistant from
the center of mass. Quadrotors tend to be slightly less
efﬁcient due to the reduced size of each propeller for a given
sized ﬂyer. Although commonly operated around hover,
recently there has been an increased interest in aggressive
maneuvers [12], [13]. Other areas of research are multi-agent
control testbeds [14], [15], stability control testbeds [16],
[17], [18], and design [19], [20].
Since this paper aims to address simple and low cost
ﬂying devices, it is reasonable to consider devices available
as toys. The simplest related ﬂying device may be what
has been called a “Chinese Top”, which is a propeller on a
stick. Of course it has no controllability, but has interesting
aerodynamicpropertiesincludingdifferentialliftstabilization
that will become important later in this paper.
In this work we explore a minimalistic device composed
of just two rotors (or a rotor and a dragplate) with no swash
plate, propelled by a single motor.
A simple ﬂying toy called the Air Hogs Vectron Wave
[21] has this structure. It ﬂies in a stable manner, but is only
controllable in the vertical direction. This device is passively
stable. Understanding why it works and is stable is a central
contribution of this paper.
In the next section we deﬁne the vehicle structure and
its critical parameters, followed by the equations of motion

ysis of the passive stability of the vehicle and a model which
can be used to understand the design parameters’ effects on
stability. The last sections verify the model, equations, and
stability analysis with a variety of design implementations,
which show both stability and instability.
II. PROPOSED VEHICLE
The device is minimalistic, composed of just two moving
parts attached to a motor. A propeller is attached to the
motor’s rotor and a dragplate is attached to the motor’s
stator. There is no swash plate, no anti-torque tail rotor, and
only one, instead of four, rotors. The main issue with the
single propeller is controllability. Yim introduced a concept
for attitude control of counter rotating propeller systems
without a swashplate in [22] and, more recently, Paulos
et al. [23] developed a simple hinged propeller that can
induce control moments like a swashplate just by pulsing the
propeller cyclically. This paper will not focus on this type of
attitude control, though these methods are compatible with
this device and are planned to be implemented after passive
stability has been established.
The vehicle is illustrated in Figure 1 along with the frame
assignments: S attached to the stator and R attached the
rotor. The vehicle’s single lifting propeller is mounted such
that the thrust vector nominally goes through the center of
mass (COM), lying on the Z axis of the collinear rotor and
stator frames. Dragplates, which spin on the same axis, but
in opposite direction from the propeller, are used to counter
the propeller torque. Optionally, low Reynolds number air-
foils are used on the dragplates to generate extra lift. The
dragplates are arranged symmetrically around the propeller
axis of rotation so the aerodynamic center of pressure (COP)
also lies on the Z axis of the rotor or stator frames. Note that
while COM and COP both lie on the z axis, they do not have
to be designed to be coincident.
The signs of the velocities will become important in
stability analysis. We will use Figure 1 as the example. Here
the Z axis points downward. The rotor propeller spins with
a right-handed positive rotation about Z. The dragplate are
left-handed, rotating with a negative rotation about Z.
III. VEHICLE DYNAMICS
To control such a vehicle, we must understand its gov-
erning equations. It is a two body system: the stator and
the rotor bodies. For the purposes of notation, aerodynamic
forces and moments are felt by the dragplates,F

,M

, and
the propeller, F
P
, M
P
, while frames are referenced to the
stator and rotor, indicated by superscripted or subscripted
S and R respectively. Additional frames, indicated with
subscript and superscriptI andF, are the inertial frame and
the ﬂyer frame. The ﬂyer frame is a ﬁctional frame at the
COM whose Z axis has no rotational velocity relative to the
environment (e.g. velocities ofS andR relativeF can yield
aerodynamic properties), and can be thought of as the pilot’s
frame. Newton’s equation is:

its corresponding counterparts.
Position control of this vehicle is similar to that of a
quadrotor, where in hover the thrust compensates exactly for
gravity and the translational velocities depend on the attitude
(roll and pitch) away from this nominal hover position.
IV. STABILITY
Partofcontrollingavehicleinvolvesstablemotion.Unsta-
ble motion is characterized by unbounded velocities that ulti-
mately lead to a crash. The active method of stability senses
the state of the vehicle and controls velocities explicitly. A
trivial passive method for imposing stability is to include
large dampers such that any lateral motion is damped out.
Forces eventually reach equilibrium at a terminal velocity. A
more desirable stable condition is one in which unwanted
velocities go to zero. In this type of vehicle we aim to
passively orient its attitude, and thereby vector its thrust,
in order to cancel any disturbance forces and reduce motion.
This means that velocities in a given direction need rotations
about the perpendicular axis.
Throughout this analysis, u, v, w, p, q, r will denote X,
Y, Z linear and angular velocities in the ﬂyer frame,?,?,?
are the world to body euler angles, and X, Y, Z, L, M, N
are the forces and moments in the ﬂyer frame.
A. COP>COM
One type of stabilization can occur by introducing mo-
ments that cause a change in attitude, directing the thrust
to slow translational velocities. Intuitively, as a vehicle with
high dragplates (i.e. the COP has more negative z value than
COM) translates through air, the air velocity pushes on the
dragplates causing a moment about the COM which results
in the downward thrust turning in the direction of translation
5511
and slowing the vehicle down, passively stabilizing it. We
will call this phenomenon COP>COM and was shown by
Teoh et al. to stabilize the Robobee platform [24]
As an example, if a vehicle with this COP>COM feature
is modeled as simple a rigid object in space and has only a
velocityu,theCOP>COMcreatesamoment,M,causingan
angular acceleration which integrates to slow the X velocity.

is the entire vehicle’s inertia in the X and Y direction,
which are treated as equal. This result is favorable for the
Robobee which has no net angular momentum. Angular
momentum will cause secondary reactions from gyroscopic
effects. In the case of the proposed vehicle, integrating
Equation (3) over time will result in nonzero?
Y
, which will
yield a precession as seen from Equation (2), in this case an
angular acceleration about the X axis.

A number of values must be in the proper range for this
method to stabilize a vehicle. In this case, with nonzero
X velocity, stability requires a positive ˙ ?

must be true. This occurs when the COP is above the COM.
Second, M >> ?

thus nutation, at a minimum.
B. Differential Lift
Another type of stabilization with restoring moments can
be seen in the Chinese Top that passively orients its attitude
using differential lift. This phenomenon applies moments to
spinning propellers. As the device moves away from hover,
with some linear velocity through the air, one side of the
propeller sees a higher relative wind velocity, called the ad-
vancingside,andgeneratesexcessliftasaresult.Conversely,
the opposite, retreating side, generates less lift. This couple
results in a moment about the direction of travel. Gyroscopic
effects then result in an angular velocity perpendicular to
this moment. The Chinese Top’s attitude changes to slow
the horizontal translation, passively stabilizing the vehicle.
For differential lift, the vehicle velocity in the positive X
direction yields a negative moment,L, exclusively about the
X axis as a result of the left-handed rotation of the dragplate:

For this method to stabilize the present vehicle with an
initial X velocity, we again need a positive ˙ ?
Y
. If the
I
Z
> I
XY
and the body with a higher angular momentum
generates more differential lift, its corresponding precession
will give a stabilizing torque. In the example of the vehicle
in Figure 1, with dominant dragplates moving linearly in
the positive X direction, ?
X
is negative and ?
Z
is a left-
handed propeller and is thus also negative. Further, we want
˙ ?
X
to be relatively small compared to ˙ ?
Y
. A large angular
momentum in the Z direction allows for a large ˙ ?
Y
. The
nutation term will cancel the original undesired moment
once the precession commences. If I
XY

Z
, the sign

ﬂips in Equation 7, requiring the body with less
angular momentum to generate more differential lift to be
stable. Again, this example assumes that there are no initial
moments about the Y axis, i.e. the COP goes through the
COM.
C. Design Implications
The math suggests two distinct designs. The ﬁrst,
COP>COM, case stabilizes itself when the net angular
momentum is low and no net differential lift is produced.
Larger angular momentum about Z increases the destabi-
lizing effects from the precession and nutation from the
COP>COM moments. Vehicles with an even number of
symmetric contra-rotating propellers that in general cancel
theirrotationalinertia,suchascoaxialandquadrotors,ﬁtthis
category, as well as propellerless vehicles like ornithopters.
Unfortunately, multiple propellers implies multiple motors or
complex transmissions, which adds complexity and cost.
The second case recommends a large angular momentum
and large differential lift. In addition, it is better if the
COP and COM are coincident in this case, since a large
angular momentum coupled with a COP>COM will result
in large destabilizing terms. To increase angular momentum,
the dominating differential lift body should increase Z an-
gular momentum. Because this is a ﬂying vehicle, adding
unnecessary weight to increase inertia is undesirable, thus
the designer should aim to increase angular velocity.

angular momentum, to account for the extra thrust. Note that
efﬁciency does decrease slightly by adding more blades.

D. Stability Analysis
Proof of the vehicle’s stability can be achieved with
the Routh-Hurwitz criteria, which uses the linearized state
transition matrix A in the form ˙ x = Ax. This criterion
depends on the characteristic equation det(A??I) = 0,
5512
which for a second order system is a polynomial of the form
a

= 0, and states that stability is assured if
and only if all a
i
> 0, among other constraints for higher
order polynomials. Linearization is done about hover.
Considering only the velocity and attitude terms in the
state vector and ignoring rotations and translations in the Z
direction, the state vector of the vehicle can be reduced from
18 to 6 terms:

u v p q ? ?

T
. To simplify notation,
the linearized partial derivatives are rewritten as the force
caused by the subscripted velocity normalized by mass or
inertia, for example,
∂X
m∂u
= X
u
and
∂L
I
XY
∂p
= L
p
. The
linearized equations of motion become Equation (9).
The linear forces perpendicular to the linear motion, X
v
andY
u
, are very small in this conﬁguration and these speeds,
so we will ignore them. Similarly, linear drag caused by
rotating the ﬂyer is sufﬁciently small, so we can ignore X
p
,
X
q
, Y
p
, and Y
q
as well.
In the linearized model about the hover condition, the
state vector can be further reduced to

p q

, the roll rate
and the pitch rate, since ? and ? are the integrals of p and
q when using the small angle approximation. Variables u
and v are functions of the integrals of ? and ? respectively.
Symmetry around the vertical axis allows the combination
of the remaining partial derivatives from the Jacobian. For
convenience we rename the derivatives and describe them:

Executing the Routh-Hurwitz criteria on the above determi-
nant gives stability constraints on the partial derivatives. One
trivial result from the a
5
term is that a and d summed is
negative. These terms are simply drag, indicating that the
drag forces and moments express themselves in the opposite
direction from motion and are always negative.
Another simple result from the a
1
term is that cd > be,
since we already know a is negative and g is positive.
The ﬁrst term calls for COP>COM, since a negative c is
COP>COM and d is always negative. The second term is
from differential lift and gyroscopic precession, and suggests
they be of opposite sign, which occurs when one body domi-
nates differential lift and angular momentum. This shows the
balance of the COP>COM versus differential lift methods.
Another constraint from Routh-Hurwitz commands cg >
(3ad + a
2

2
)(a + d) + de

. The ﬁrst term on the
right side indicates that more drag increases stability. The
second term states that if the angular momentum has a large
magnitude, COP can be lowered. Both can be thought of
as requiring damping. Further constraints are possible to
ﬁnd; however, their complexity increases greatly from the
previous examples.
V. SIMULATION
To help ﬁnd viable parameters for new conﬁgurations,
a simulator was developed in MATLAB. This dynamic
simulator used the equations of motion from section III, as
well as the Rankine-Froude equation for rotor disk inﬂow,
motor equations, and blade element theory. This simulator
allows the examination of parameters such as dragplate size
and location, stator and rotor inertias, and propeller type.
To test for stability, the vehicle initially is oriented in
the hover condition with a 0.1 radians error in the X roll
direction. If a vehicle’s states stabilize over time, then that
vehicle presents a candidate for experimental veriﬁcation.
It was found that the simulator claimed the virtual vehicles
would be more stable than their real counterparts. A new
parameter, a rotor tilt angle, was added to account for man-
ufacturing errors. It makes the hover thrust not go through
the COM. While the average moments created by this angle
cancelafteronerevolutionofthestator,virtualconﬁgurations
that were once stable are no longer. Errors between 0.035
radians and 0.087 radians correlated well with real results.
VI. EXPERIMENTAL HARDWARE
The simulator guided the design of two prototypes, a wide
variant (Figure 2) and a tall variant (Figure 3), each with
variable elements. Some of the variable elements, which
are shown in Figure 4, include dragplates of different sizes,
location,andnumberaswellasmountingarmsforpropellers
with varying inertial and lift properties.
Inthe tallversion,thedragplateshaveno liftandonlypro-
vide anti-torque, while having very low angular momentum.
This allows the propeller’s angular momentum to outweigh
that of the dragplates. Furthermore, the propeller is the only
source of differential lift. The dragplates were created from
a laser cut ABS frame and covered in a polyester ﬁlm. Nine
dragplates were constructed with varying COP distance in
5mm increments along Z.
The wide version features mounting points for up to eight
dragplates. Unlike in the tall version, these dragplates both
provide lift and inertia, achieving I
Z
> I
XY
. Beams of
varying dragplate mounting heights were constructed, again
out of laser cut ABS, and increment every 5mm with a total
of 14 positions. Three types of airfoils were mounted to
these frames. One type is seen mounted on the vehicle in
Figure 2 and another is visible on the top right of Figure 4.

Fig. 2: Wide variant
Fig. 3: Tall variant
A base housing the electronics and motor was created. A
custom motor driver communicates to a computer running
MATLAB over an AT86RF radio. The STM32F373 micro-
controller commutes the E-Flight Park 400 740Kv brushless
motor using an AS5145B encoder, records IMU data from
an MPU-6050, and transmits data back to the computer. This
base was mounted to both the tall and wide versions, and can
be seen in both Figures 2 and 3.
VII. EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS
Throughout the test, three parameters were varied. The
most obvious is the height of COP vs COM by use of the
interchangeable dragplates. Another is by varying the inertia
throughinterchangingpropellersandaddingmassattheends
of the dragplates. Inertia is again varied by changing from
the tall to wide version, switching I
XY
to I
Z
as the larger
direction of inertia. Finally, the number of dragplate blades
is varied to conﬁrm that differential lift is the stabilizing
moment and increases with the number of blades.
The results of a subset of trials is shown in Table I. Ver-
sions marked with a U in the Stable column were unstable.
Those marked with U* were unstable, but remained aloft for
more than 5 seconds before reaching a critical angle. The
lone S is the stable vehicle and is the one shown in Figure
2. The I
Z
refers to the rotor or stator I
Z
, which ever is
dominant (i.e. rotor I
Z
for all of the tall conﬁgurations and
stator for all wide conﬁgurations).
Despite having more conﬁgurations, the tall variant was
always unstable. This agrees with the conclusions in Section
Fig. 4: Variable replaceable elements
IV-B that when I
XY
> I
Z
the net differential lift must
be generated by the body with less angular momentum.
Since the dragplates were designed with a π/2 radian angle
of attack, they create no lift, and thus no differential lift.
Dragplates with angles of attack other than π/2 have been
tested and show promise, but the vehicle was destroyed in a
crashfrominstability.Footageisontheaccompanyingvideo.
The wide version was designed to generate lift from its
dragplates. Initial versions utilized large Reynolds number
airfoils at various angles of attack. Despite their position,
shape, and size, no set had larger differential lift than the
propeller’s, which was in the opposite direction. Finally, a
version that spanned the width of the crossbar was created,
ﬂown, and showed promise. The body of the version with
four dragplates spun faster than the onboard IMU’s limit of
34.9
rad
s
, and therefore the listed angular momentum is <-
0.02. This version precessed in the same direction despite
large changes in COP>COM, which is an indication that
the differential lift was insufﬁcient, thus more blades were
added. With eight blades, and small tweaking of the COM,
the vehicle ﬂew stably.
The COP to COM column in Table I lists the separation
distance along Z, where negative values have COP above
COM (the COP>COM condition). COM location is esti-
mated from a 3D model and COP location is estimated as
the centroid of the projected area on a vertical plane.
Note that the wide conﬁgurations all have positive COP
to COM which is destabilizing to both COP>COM and
differential lift mechanisms. It is likely that the centroid
method of COP estimation likely indicates COP lower than it
shouldbe.Thisisbecausethethinbarandhoopstructureson

that is signiﬁcantly far from the estimated COP erroneously

the drag signiﬁcantly, and could be why the second to last

TABLE I: Stability results of various vehicle conﬁgurations
thanthelast,stableconﬁguration.Thedifferencebetweenthe
two conﬁgurations was the vertical location of the outer ring,
visible in Figure 2. The unstable version had it at the bottom,
while the stable conﬁguration was with it as depicted.
The ring may have generated more drag in the unstable
conﬁguration (while in the downwash of the propeller) or the
dragplates may create more drag than estimated. Regardless,
this measurement indicates that the COP did move, and
certain locations were more stable than others.
VIII. CONCLUSION
We have explored a variety of ﬂying conﬁgurations for
a novel, simple, low cost ﬂyer based on a single motor.
We have identiﬁed two mechanisms for passive stability
of ﬂying devices we call COP>COM and differential lift,
and discovered that they end up emphasizing conﬂicting
design parameters. A large distance between COP and COM,
required for COP>COM will destabilize the differential
lift method. A large net angular momentum required for
differential lift will destabilize COP>COM.
After fourteen trials of varying COP position, dragplate
size, rotational inertia, and rotational speeds, one set of
parameterswasfoundtobestable.Thissuccessfuldesignhas
been reduced to two optimizations. The ﬁrst is minimizing
the COP>COM effect by minimizing the distance between
COP and COM. The second is maximizing the precession
from differential lift by increasing the dominant body’s
inertia, and increasing the number of lifting blades.
There should be other parameters in the design space
that also passively stabilize. The COP>COM method would
work for a vehicle with similar angular momentum between
rotorandstatorand alargedistancebetweenCOPand COM.
This is left for future work. In the near future, combining the
passive stability with control methods for arbitrary position-
ing by pulsing the one motor will be implemented.
