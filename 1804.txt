Abstract—A load sensor with high sensitivity, a wide 
measurement range, and a small size was developed by using an 
AT-cut quartz crystal resonator (QCR). The quartz crystal 
generates a charge that is proportional to the external force. 
Because it has high sensitivity and excellent temperature 
stability, it has been used for various sensors. In particular, a 
QCR has an inherently superior static-load-sensing 
characteristic. However, a QCR is fragile and easily broken by a 
stress concentration. Moreover, a retention mechanism is 
required to efficiently transmit the load, and it is necessary to fix 
the QCR firmly to avoid a horizontal force. Moreover, it is very 
difficult to miniaturize the retention mechanism because the 
fabrication and assembly process is complicated. We previously 
proposed a miniaturized sensor element that was developed 
using microfabrication. The QCR load sensor had an 
enormously wide force-sensing range of greater than 10
4
 N. 
However, the output was easily affected by a change in the 
parasitic capacitance around the QCR. The objective of this 
study was to improve the load-measurement resolution and 
stabilize the sensor output for application to biological signal 
detection. We fabricated a QCR sensor with a sensitivity of 973 
Hz/N and succeeded in detecting multiple biological signals 
(respiration, heartbeat, and posture) with using proposed QCR 
load sensor. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
High-sensitivity, high-speed-response, and small-size load 
sensors are desired in many fields, including the medical field, 
life support robotics, and industrial robotics. Once such a 
high-performance load sensor is developed, it will be possible 
to handle fragile objects and/or heavy objects intelligently 
using a single robot. Moreover, health management will be 
realized by the simultaneous detection of multiple biological 
signals such as body pressure (high load), pulse/blood 
pressure (small load), and respiration (small load) on a 
bed/chair. 
Although there have been several reports of load sensors 
that use strain gauges [1], piezoelectric vibration [2], or 
capacitance change, none of the conventional sensors meet 
the previously mentioned requirements. Recently, to realize 
such a high-performance load sensor, we have focused on a 
quartz crystal, which is one of the piezoelectric elements and 
has self-sensing capability. A quartz crystal generates a 
charge that is proportional to the external force, and has 
excellent properties, including high sensitivity, temperature 
stability, and frequency stability. Quartz crystals have been

used for various sensors, including gas sensors [3], 
temperature sensors [4], and DNA sensors [5]. Research has 
also been conducted on their use as force sensors. The 
piezoelectric force sensors fabricated by the Kistler 
Corporation are commercially available. The sensing 
principle of these force sensors is the detection of the charge 
generated by an external force. However, force sensors based 
on this principle have the disadvantage of being easily 
affected by electric drift and noise. Therefore, they are not 
suitable for static force sensing. 
On the other hand, a quartz crystal resonator (QCR) 
generates a periodic signal with high stability based on 
vibration. The resonant frequency of a QCR changes with high 
linearity depending on the external force [6–7]. Therefore, a 
highly sensitive load sensor with a wide measurement range 
can be realized using a QCR. In addition, the whole system 
can be miniaturized, because the frequency output can be 
directly processed as a digital signal without using an 
analog-to-digital converter.  
However, a QCR is fragile and easily broken by a stress 
concentration. Moreover, a retention mechanism is required to 
efficiently transmit the external load to the QCR, and it has to 
be fixed firmly in place to prevent a horizontal force [8–11]. 
Miniaturizing the retention mechanism is quite difficult, 
because the fabrication and assembly process is complicated. 
We previously developed a miniaturized sensor element by 
using microfabrication [12–13]. However, its output was 
easily affected by a change in the parasitic capacitance around 
the QCR. 
In this study, our goal was the precise detection of 
biological signals. To increase the sensitivity and reduce the 
total volume of the packaged sensor, we propose a new design 
for a QCR load sensor with a miniaturized retention 
mechanism, which efficiently transmits a load to the QCR. We 
improved the sensor output by reducing the hysteresis of the 
sensor and the effect of the parasitic capacitance.

II. CONCEPT OF QCR SENSOR 
A.  Quartz Crystal Resonator 
An AT-cut quartz crystal has a high resonance frequency 
and superior temperature stability at room temperature. When 
an alternating voltage is applied between two metal 
electrodes on the QCR, a thickness-shear vibration oscillates 
along the quartz crystal’s electrical axis (x-axis) (Fig. 1). 
When an external load is applied to the QCR, its resonance 
frequency changes. The sensitivity of the sensor depends on 
the cutting direction of the QCR. The width of the current 
QCR was decreased from 3.0 mm to 2.0 mm compared with 
our previous work [13]. With a decrease in the cross-sectional 
area, the internal stress of the QCR increased and the 
sensitivity of the sensor was improved.  
Stable vibration of the QCR is needed to improve the 
force-measurement resolution. The stability is related to the Q 
factor of the QCR. An oscillation failure occurs when using a 
QCR with a low Q factor. Therefore, a high Q factor is needed. 
The miniaturization of a QCR tends to produce a low Q factor. 
We have to consider the electrode thickness, electrode 
diameter, shape of the QCR, and wiring for the QCR. In this 
research, the electrode thickness was set at 250 nm and the 
electrode diameter was set at 1 mm. Copper wire with a 
diameter of 0.05 mm was used. The Q factor deteriorates with 
a disturbance in the mechanical and electrical vibrations of a 
QCR. Vibration is generated from the center electrode of the 
QCR. The position of the wiring pad and the load application 
point should be away from the center electrode. Therefore, 
the height of the QCR was increased from 3.0 mm [13] to 3.5 
mm to improve the Q factor. The load was applied at an angle 
of 34.8° to the x-axis of the AT-cut QCR. Stress sensitivity is 
not changed by temperature fluctuation from this direction. A 
schematic of the QCR is shown in Fig. 1. 
 
B. Retention Mechanism and Packaging 
As mentioned above, a QCR is fragile and easily broken 
by a stress concentration. Thus, a good retention mechanism 
is required to efficiently transmit the load. Here, we propose a 
retention mechanism that has parallel flat springs. We unified 
the retention mechanism to simplify the assembly process 
(Fig. 2). This unification of the sensor parts contributed to a 
reduction in the hysteresis. We determined the dimensions 
and material properties of the sensor by a finite element 
analysis using COMSOL Multiphysics 4.3b (COMSOL Inc.). 
We reduced the influence of unexpected loads on the QCR by 
adopting parallel leaf springs for the retention mechanism. 
Fig. 3(a) shows the results of a deformation analysis of the 
retention mechanism when a horizontal force (F
h
) of 1 N was 
applied. Fig. 3(b) shows the y-axis displacements of single 
and parallel leaf retention mechanisms. We confirmed that 
the deformation of the parallel leaf springs was reduced

compared with the case of using a single leaf spring. A 
smaller displacement against a horizontal force is preferable. 
Therefore, we adopted the parallel leaf springs. A uniform 
stress should be applied to the QCR for precise measurement. 
We evaluated the stress distribution on the QCR. Fig. 4(a) 
shows the results of an analysis when a perpendicular 
compressive load of 10 N was applied to the QCR. Fig. 4(b) 
shows the stress distribution at the center of the QCR. Fig. 
4(c) shows the relationship between height h of the push bar 
in Fig. 4(a) and the relative error between ?
ave
 and ?
max
. The 
relative error decreases with an increase in the value of h. 
When h is 1 mm or greater, the relative error remains constant. 
From this analysis, considering the need to miniaturize the 
retention mechanism, a value of 1 mm was selected for h. 
From Fig. 5, we confirmed that the QCR was loaded with 
a uniform compressive stress distribution along the x-axis. 
The perpendicular compressive load was 10 N, whereas the 
loaded compressive stress of the QCR was 43 MPa (8.6 N, 
where the sectional area of the QCR was 0.1 ? 2.0 mm). We 
defined the ratio of the compressive load applied to the QCR 
to the vertical component of the external load as the “load 
conversion efficiency.” The load conversion efficiency of this 
retention mechanism was 86%, whereas that of the 
conventional one was 70% [13]. Therefore, it is expected that 
the resolution will be improved. The allowable stress for an 
AT-cut quartz crystal is 150 MPa. Considering the load 
conversion efficiency, the maximum allowable load of this 
sensor is 35 N. 
For sensor packaging, we employed a screw mechanism 
that made it possible to apply a preload to the retention 
mechanism. The linearity of the sensor was improved by 
preloading. We arranged a relay point for the wiring to reduce 
its resistance (Fig. 6). 
 
Oscillation Circuit 
To obtain stable oscillation at the resonance frequency, 
the vibration signal must be amplified by using an oscillation 
circuit (Fig. 7 ). An oscillation circuit that used a CMOS 
inverter was adopted to miniaturize the circuit board. A 
bypass capacitor, power supply noise filter, and 
high-frequency filter were all integrated to reduce noise. This 
oscillation circuit can be miniaturized and placed near the 
QCR. 
 
III. FABRICATION OF QCR SENSOR 
A. QCR 
Fig. 8 shows the fabrication process for the QCR. 
Micromachining was used to fabricate an AT-cut quartz 
crystal plate (100 ?m thick) with both sides polished. 
Electrode patterns were formed using photolithography and a 
liftoff process. In photolithography, lift-off resist (LOR 5B, 
KAYAKU MICROCHEM Co., Ltd.) was used to create an 
undercut profile (Fig. 8). After photolithography was applied 
to the quartz crystal plate, Cr and Au films were deposited

(15 cp, TOKYO OHKA KOGYO Co., Ltd.) and LOR were 
patterned, and the Cr–Au film was removed using a stripper. 
This was done on both sides of the AT-cut quartz crystal 
substrate. Both surfaces of the patterned quartz plate were cut 
using a dicing saw (DAD-522, Disco Co.), and a large 
number of resonators were fabricated simultaneously. The Q 
factor of the QCR was calculated to be 54,000 using equation 
(1).

Here, the equivalent electrical resistance (R
1
) was 47.5??? 
and the inductance (L
1
) was 26.1 mH, which was measured 
using an impedance analyzer (ZA5403, NF Component CO.).  
B. Retention Mechanism and Packaging 
Fig. 9(a) shows the fabricated parts of the QCR load sensor. 
The retention mechanism was fabricated using end milling. 
Phosphor bronze, which has an excellent spring characteristic, 
was used for the retention mechanism. SUS304, which has 
high rigidity and excellent corrosion resistance, was used for 
the casing and screw. Fig. 9(b) shows the fabricated sensor. 
C. QCR Load Sensor Packaging with Circuit 
The QCR load sensor and oscillation circuit were 
connected by wiring. Parasitic capacitance exists in the 
wiring. Therefore, we integrated the QCR load sensor and 
oscillation circuit, which reduced the sensor output error 
caused by this parasitic capacitance. Furthermore, the 
oscillation circuit was covered with a metal case, which 
moderated the fluctuation of the sensor output by providing 
an electrostatic shield. The QCR load sensor and oscillation 
circuit were 12 mm in diameter and 11 mm in height (Fig. 
10). 
IV. CHARACTERISTIC EVALUATION OF QCR SENSOR 
A. Loading 
We calibrated the fabricated QCR load sensor by loading 
a weight. A voltage of 5 V was applied to the oscillation 
circuit, and the sensor output was measured using a frequency 
counter (53131A, Hewlett Packard). Fig. 11 shows the results 
for the load–frequency relationship without preloading. The

sensor output did not change linearly, because of a gap 
between the parts. A preload had to be applied to obtain a 
good performance. Fig. 12 shows the results for the 
load–frequency relationship with preloading. In this 
experiment, loads of 0 N to 15 N were applied in 1-N 
increments and unloaded from 15 N to 0 N in 1-N decrements. 
The results of this experiment showed that the fabricated 
QCR load sensor with preloading had a very good linear 
property. The nonlinearity was calculated to be 1.13% of the 
full scale (FS). The hysteresis of the sensor was calculated to 
be 1.78% FS, and the sensitivity of the sensor was high (973 
Hz/N).  
 
B. Stability of Sensor Output 
The measured frequency stability of the sensor is shown 
in Fig. 13. The measurements showed that the fluctuation of 
the frequency of the sensor was 0.04 ppm or less. The 
fluctuation of the sensor output was calculated to be 0.66 mN 
or less.  
Fig. 14(a) shows the conventional problem of the sensor 
output being changed by the parasitic capacitance. The sensor 
was connected to the circuit by wiring (about 10 cm in length). 
The sensor output changed when the sensor was shaded by a 
hand. The experimental results are shown in Fig. 14(b). A 
similar experiment was conducted using our QCR sensor and 
circuit. The experimental results are shown in Fig. 14(c). The 
fluctuation of the sensor output was drastically smaller than 
that for the conventional sensor.  
 
C. Temperature Characteristic 
The sensor output was measured when the temperature of 
the sensor was changed from 25°C to 60°C. The temperature 
of the sensor was measured using a thermocouple 
thermometer bonded to the sensor system (AD-5602, A&D 
Corp.). Fig. 15 shows the relation between the temperature 
and the sensor output when the temperature is increased from 
25°C to 60°C. The temperature and sensor output have a 
linear relationship. Temperature compensation can be easily 
performed by using equation (2). 
 Y= -33.105x?10

This sensor mounting system could be used at room 
temperature as well as temperatures in the vicinity of body 
temperature, and it is expected to be applicable in the medical 
and nursing fields. 
V. BIOLOGICAL DETECTION 
A. Experimental Setup 
Fig. 16 shows the setup of a chair for the detection of 
biological signals. The fabricated QCR load sensor was fixed 
on the back of the chair to detect biological signals: 
respiration, heartbeat, and posture. To increase the contact 
area, the sensor was pinched between two semi-round bars. 
The sensor was positioned near the heart to detect the minute 
force generated by the heartbeat. In addition, a sensor was 
placed under a cushion so that the subjects felt comfortable in

In the experiment, measurements began without a load 
(the subject did not lean against the chair). Approximately 5 s 
later, the subject leaned back in the chair. Approximately 20 s 
later, the subject held his/her breath. 
B. Experimental Results 
Fig. 17 shows the measurement results on a subject (24 
years old, male, 182 cm tall). The resonant frequency 
changed by approximately 3,000 Hz by leaning. When the 
subject leaned against the chair, the sensor output changed 
periodically (Fig. 17(a)). This periodic change was not 
observed while the subject held his breath. Therefore, this 
periodic change might have been caused by breathing. 
Moreover, smaller (~20 Hz) and faster (~0.9 s cycle) periodic 
changes were observed when the subject held his breath (Fig. 
17(b)). Compared with the sensor output when the subject did 
not lean against the chair (Fig. 17(c)), this change was 
sufficiently large that it did not appear to be noise. The 
change was around 70 peaks/min. Thus, this smaller and 
faster periodic change might have been caused by the beating 
of the heart. The change is visible in Fig. 17(a). These results 
demonstrate that multiple biological signals (respiration, 
heartbeat, and posture) were successfully detected using our 
QCR load sensor. 
VI. CONCLUSIONS 
We succeeded in improving the sensor sensitivity and 
miniaturization of a QCR load sensor. The microfabricated 
QCR with the new retention mechanism had a high 
load-conversion efficiency. We also proposed a sensor 
packaging design, and integrated an oscillation circuit with 
the sensor. We solved the practical noise problem caused by 
parasitic capacitance. As a result, the accuracy and stability of 
the sensor were greatly improved. We succeeded in detecting 
multiple biological signals (respiration, heartbeat, and 
posture) by using the proposed QCR load sensor. 
As a prospect for the future, the QCR load sensor requires 
a temperature compensator for long-term biological detection. 
Automatic detection by signal processing is also required.
