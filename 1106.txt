Abstract—Weintroduceasix-actuatorroboticjoint
mechanism with biarticular coupling inspired by the
human limb which neither requires pneumatic artiﬁ-
cial muscles nor tendon coupling. The actuator can
independently change monoarticular and biarticular
sti?ness as well as both joint positions. We model and
analyse the actuator with respect to sti?ness variabil-
ityincomparisonwithanactuatorwithoutbiarticular
coupling. We demonstrate that the biarticular cou-
pling considerably extends the range of sti?ness with
an 70-fold improvement in versatility, in particular
withrespecttotheend-pointCartesiansti?nessshape

I. Introduction
Variable Sti?ness Actuators (VSAs) are actively being
researched because of their ability to absorb energy
during highly dynamic impacts and their possibility to
temporarily store elastic energy [1], [2], [3], [4], [5],
[6], [7]. Furthermore, humans modulate impedance in
order to meet accuracy demands during goal-directed
arm movements [8]. However, all existing tendon-free
VSAs are designed such that they are only able to
change sti?ness and position of one joint (monoarticular
(mon.art.) actuators). In biology, however, one ﬁnds
many multi-articulated skeletal muscles, crossing more
than one joint and thus changing both sti?ness and
position of each joint when activated. A special case of
these groups of muscles are biarticular (biart.) muscles,
with the prominent examples biceps and triceps brachii,
coupling shoulder and elbow. The role of these muscles
is as follows:
• morphing endpoint sti?ness—In [9, pp. 361–366]
Englishetal.analysedtheinﬂuenceofbiart.muscles
based on a musculo-skeletal model of the human
arm. They revealed that the loss of biart. muscles
leads to a more elongated sti?ness ellipse (strong
preferred displacement direction), a reduced maxi-
mum sti?ness, a reduced possible orientation range
and ﬁnally the result that sti?ness produced by
double-joint muscles cannot be replaced by using
only single-joint sti?ness.
• stabilising the limb—McIntyre et al. discussed
in [10] the role of destabilising forces at the endpoint

Patrick van der Smagt is with the Department for Informatics,
Technische Universität München, Germany
and their overall inﬂuence on joint torques. The
amount of joint torque produced, e.g., in the elbow
can a?ect the required sti?ness at the shoulder.
“...With multijoint muscles present, each muscle
sti?ness need be a function only of its own force
output in order to maintain overall limb stability.
The multiarticular muscles provide the necessary
coupling between joints. This is an example of a
mechanical design simplifying the control problem.”
The self-stabilising characteristics of biart. coupling
were also shown by Iida et al. [11], for both running
and walking gaits.
• independent control of force and position—
Kumamoto et al. showed [12] that biart. muscles
allow for an independent control of endpoint force
and position. Furthermore, they found that these
musclesallowforanindependentcontrolofendpoint
sti?ness and output force direction.
• open-loop control of position—In [13] Taub et al.
showed that monkeys with dea?erent limbs were
able to reach visual targets with and without vi-
sual feedback of limbs position. Consequently, Ku-
mamoto et al. concluded [14] that biart. muscles
allow for precise, smooth and rapid movement pat-
terns of the endpoint without the use of any po-
sitional feedback. They concluded that “...the ar-
bitrary control of the output force direction, and
elasticandviscousellipses... canmovetheendpoint
precisely to any desired target point without use of a
positional feedback signal, that is a possibility of an
open loop control.”
• transferring energy—biart. muscles provide the ca-
pability to transport the mechanical output mainly
produced by mon.art. muscles to joints where it can
e?ectively contribute to the desired aim of move-
ment [15]. E.g., during running, instead of braking
the knee using mon.art. muscles and dissipating the
energy in form of heat, the biart. muscles provide
the possibility to optimally transfer the energy to
the hip in order to maintain the forward motion.
In this paper we will present and analyse a two-joint
planar VSA with and without biart. coupling based
on the Bidirectional Antagonism with Variable Sti?ness
(BAVS). The actuator BAVS, which is neither tendon-
driven(possibledrawback:tendoncreeping)norbasedon
artiﬁcial pneumatic muscles (possible drawback: highly
nonlinear), was introduced in [16]. The focus is to inves-
tigate the ability to adapt passive (intrinsic) endpoint

sti?ness at zero net force. We will compare and discuss
these two di?erent types of VSA systems in a simulation
study in order to show what will be lost and what can
be gained in a system with biart. coupling. Therefore
we will set out to investigate the full ability to change
passive sti?ness and propose a method that allows us to
do so.
II. Related work
The use of biarticularity in robotic design is nothing
new. Di?erent implementations have been proposed: ei-
ther by tendon-driven actuation with base-ﬁxed motors
[11], [17], [18], [19], by pneumatic artiﬁcial muscles [12],
[20], [21], by planetary gears [22], [23], [24], by pul-
leys [25], or by directly coupling a linear motor with the
ende?ector[26].However,evenifsomeoftheseactuators
are able to change their active (controlled) sti?ness (e.g.,
impedancecontrol[26]orsti?nesscontrolfordisturbance
rejection[23],[25]),notalloftheseactuatorsaredesigned
to change their passive (intrinsic) sti?ness [19], [22], [23],
[24], [25], [26] even when actuated by six actuators for
two joints [18].
One of the main objectives of many studies is to
show what is gained with biart. coupling with respect to
endpoint force production [18], [20], [24], [25], [27]. It was
shown that with biart. coupling the shape of the maxi-
mum output force distribution at the endpoint becomes
more homogeneous and changes from quadrangular to
hexagonal.
A view also concentrated on the ability to change pas-
sivesti?ness[12],[14],[17],[28].In[17]Kadotaetal.built
a tendon-based robotic platform with biart. coupling
called HIPRO. HIPRO consists of six actuators arranged
inanantagonisticmannerwithnonlinearelasticelements
for a planar robotic system with two DoF. It was shown
that the system can vary the position of the endpoint
with negligible e?ects on the orientation of the Cartesian
endpoint sti?ness ellipse
1
.
In [12] and [14], Kumamoto et al. investigated the ca-
pabilities of a robotic planar arm with two DoF actuated
by six pneumatic artiﬁcial muscles. As mentioned before
the authors showed that a biart. coupling will positively
contribute to the compliant properties and allow for
independent control of either endpoint position and force
or endpoint force direction and sti?ness. Furthermore it
was shown that this coupling will lead to smooth, ﬁne,
and precise movement patterns of the endpoint.
Another study which concentrates on sti?ness ellipse
control using VSA mechanisms with biart. coupling was
presented by Kashiwagi et al. [28]. They proposed a con-
trol method called hybrid sti?ness ellipse control which
merges mechanical and controlled sti?ness of a tendon-
based two-DoF planar robotic actuator with six muscle-
like VSA and ideal exponential elastic elements. Biart.

coupling was provided in order to be able to change all
elements of the mechanical joint sti?ness matrix. With
simulated perturbations they showed that their control
method is always able to adapt to a desired control
sti?ness, while the initial response is dominated by the
adjusted intrinsic mechanical sti?ness.
III. Types
A. Principle of BAVS
Both types of VSAs that we analyse in this paper have
in common that they are based on the principle that
we call Bidirectional Antagonism with Variable Sti?-
ness (BAVS) [16], which is implemented in the forearm
rotation and both wrist joints of the DLR Hand-Arm
System [6]. Fig. 1 (top) shows a simpliﬁed version, in
which the motors can be turned around their motor axis
instead of being ﬁxed to a base frame. The two motors
are coupled with the base via nonlinear elastic elements.
Both motors can both push and pull at the drive side of
the joint and assist each other, for which reason we use
the term helping antagonism. The position of the joint

can be changed by identical motor movement, while its
sti?ness is changed by an opposed motor movement. Its
realisation as it is implemented in the DLR Hand-Arm
System is shown in Fig. 1 (bottom). The two nonlinear
elastic elements are realised using a combination of a
linear spring and a cam disc with a nonlinear relation
between its rotation and the resulting spring deﬂection.
In order to ﬁx the motors to the base frame and to use
their full power, a Harmonic Drive is used with a bedded
circular spline, which is coupled to the nonlinear elastic
element (arrangement of the harmonic drive similar to a
planetary gear).
In [16] we also introduced di?erent variations of BAVS
as they are a double/single spring solution and asymmet-
ric/symmetric cam disc shape. We showed that asym-
metric cam disc shape and a double spring solution as
it is implemented in the forearm-rotation of the DLR
Hand-Arm System (see Fig. 2) has several advantages in

comparison to single spring solution with symmetric cam
disc shape.

B. mon.art. VSA system
The mon.art. VSA system that we analyse here is a
planar robotic system with two DoF, elbow and shoulder
joint, which joints are based on the BAVS principle ex-
plained above. The system has no biart. coupling. Unlike
the implementation in the DLR Hand-Arm System (see
Fig. 2), a double-spring solution with symmetric cam
disc shape is chosen for both joints, thus simplifying
the comparability for the planned analysis. In this joint
conﬁguration the maximum stall torque of a single joint
is±8Nm and the maximum joint sti?ness 127.6Nm/rad.
C. biart. VSA system
The biart. VSA system is in terms of the mon.art.
joints identical to the mon.art. system and basically
consists of two BAVS joints with a double-spring solution
and symmetric cam discs. New is its biart. coupling
(see red dashed regions in Fig. 3). The two joints are
coupled using two series of nonlinear elastic elements
and rotatory motors. The biart. sti?ness is changed by
opposed movement of the biart. coupling motors 3 and 4.
In contrast to, e.g., the human legs, this conﬁguration is
able to adjust both joint positions and mon.art. as well
as biart. joint sti?nesses independently. This is realised
through the cam disc–roller combination—contrary to
the mon.art. BAVS—by rotating about the motor axis
without changing their relative orientations. Thus, by
identical movements of motors 3 and 4 the joint positions
can be changed without changing the biart. or mon.art.

DoF—The two drive sides of the arm are at the bottom and top
of each ﬁgure. Imagine the depicted base as the upper arm of an
elbow-shoulder conﬁguration.
In order to compare the mon.art. and biart. VSA sys-
tems in terms of sti?ness adaptability equally, identical
components (same motors, springs and cam discs) as for
the mon.art. joints are used: the motor is ﬁxed to the
frame using a Harmonic Drive with a bedded circular
spline; the nonlinear elastic element is again realised
by a combination of symmetric cam discs and linear
springs. The symmetric cam disc shape used is indeed
not the optimal conﬁguration presented in [16]. But if
an asymmetric cam disc shape would be used, di?erent

and mon.art. actuators could emerge. Thus it would be
di?cult to keep the joint position constant during co-
contraction of the biart. elastic elements.
IV. Analysis
In this section we will model the two systems and
compare them with respect to adjustable static sti?ness;
no e?ects of damping and inertia are considered. Even
if the di?erence between the two mechanisms would be

of comparison is more intuitive due to its comparability
to human measurements, e.g. [29]. The analysis of the
di?erent types is done by modelling a planar two-DoF
arm systems with shoulder (S) and elbow (E) joints (see
Fig. 4).

In general, the joint sti?ness matrix can be calculated
by R = ∂T/∂Q ? R

, where T and Q are the
joint torques and the external joint deﬂections; n the
number of joints. Because the sti?ness of each joint
can be changed, R is a square matrix. For the systems
considered here this matrix equals

The ﬁrst index of the scalar entries of (7) indicates the

B. Comparison of the eigenvalues in Cartesian space
It is obvious that the biart. actuator can reach larger
sti?ness ranges than the mon.art. VSA, because the
biart. coupling increases o?-diagonal as well as diagonal
terms of the joint sti?ness matrix R (see Eq. (4)–(7)).
In order to show what can be gained with respect to the
biart. coupling rather than showing how more actuators
will increase the sti?ness we limited the compared Carte-
sian sti?ness space to the maximum/ minimum range
that the mon.art. actuator is able to reach (4≤ K

Fig. 5. Comparison of the Cartesian sti?ness K that can be reached by the two systems and their di?erence—The eigenvalues of the
(symmetric) Cartesian sti?ness matrix and the orientation of the corresponding eigenvector are depicted. In Fig. 5(a) and 5(c) the larger
eigenvalue ?max is depicted in green, the small eigenvalue ?max in blue in form of a distance to the centre of the polar plot. The radius
of the polar plot is normalized to range between 0 and 1 where a radius of 1 corresponds to the biggest ?max. The polar angle of each
eigenvalue corresponds to the respective orientation. The darker a colour of a segment the more often this eigenvalue was reached. The
black line in each plot corresponds to the convex hull. The comparison in Fig. 5(b) shows in green and blue, which points can only be
reached by the biart. system, and in red which only the mon.art. system can reach. The mon.art. VSA can reach 0.2% of the 10

K at the end e?ector within the achievable range of
Cartesian sti?ness the mon.art. actuator is able to reach
instead ofvaryingsti?ness in joint space. In order to keep
the analysis simple, we make following restrictions:
• The link lengths l
S
=l
E
=l = 0.8m are identical.
• As it can be seen from Eq. (9) and (10), Cartesian
sti?ness K can be adjusted by changing the joint
position and keeping joint sti?ness R constant. Be-
cause the suggested VSA systems are able to adjust
their joint sti?ness independent from joint position
we will compare them in a central position with a
shoulder angle ﬁxed at 45
?
and an elbow angle of
90
?
.
• We will only allow changes in sti?ness caused by co-
contraction which can be preset by the VSA around
anequilibriumpositionwithoutanyinteractionwith
the environment. Changes in sti?ness that will lead
to a change in joint position or emerge from an ex-
ternal deﬂection of the joints will not be considered.
• Only co-contraction of respective antagonistic pairs
will be allowed for the biart. VSA. Thus, it will not
be possible to contract a biart. actuator against a
mon.art. one and vice versa.

Becausewithinthisworkweassumeonlysti?nessaround
an equilibrium position without any external deﬂection,
Eqs. (3), (5) and (6) only depend on the mentioned
pretensions.
The (symmetric) Cartesian sti?ness matrix K was
computed for 10
6
di?erent conﬁgurations. These Carte-
sian sti?nesses were transformed to joint space and it
was checked whether a corresponding set of combinations
of mon.art. and biart. cam disc pretensions within the
maximumdeﬂectionofthecamdiscscouldbefound.The
transformation of the set into joint space will typically
lead to non-zero o?-diagonal joint sti?ness terms. Since
the mon.art. VSA can only vary diagonal joint sti?ness
terms ofR and a computation ofR out of varyingK will
almost never lead to zero o?-diagonal terms, we limited
them to a corresponding maximum pretension of 0.1
?
for
the mon.art. VSA. This corresponds approximately to
the accuracy within which the cam discs can be adjusted.
If we would allow only exactly zero o?-diagonal terms
for the mon.art. system, the capability of this system
would be disproportionately high underestimated. Note
that, in a real system as well, e.g. due to static friction,
the computation of R out of a measured K of a system
without biart. coupling would most likely never lead to
zero o?-diagonal terms of R.
Following the representation in [30], we depict the
distributions of Cartesian sti?nesses that can be reached
by the two systems in Fig. 5. The mon.art. system is
able to reach 0.2%, the biart. VSA 14.5% of the 10
6
Cartesian sti?ness combinations. Fig. 5(b) shows the
di?erence between the compared systems. It shows that
the biart. coupling allows the system to reach many more
eigenvalues ofK than just the mon.art. system is capable
of
2
. However, there are also sections which can only be
reached by the mon.art. VSA. We will examine this more
2
Note that, if we will use the same representation to depict the
sti?ness R in joint space, the mon.art. system will only be able to
reach values along the horizontal and vertical axis, while the biart.
system will as well reach in-between sti?ness combinations.

C. Comparison of shape and orientation of endpoint
sti?ness
Hogan introduced in [29] a singular value decomposi-
tion of the endpoint sti?ness matrix K to visualise the
sti?ness as an ellipse with its attributes size, shape and
orientation as a way of graphical representation of the
sti?ness conﬁguration at the endpoint. The characteris-
tics shape and orientation can be considered as criteria
of quality while the size is a criterion of quantity. Since it
is quite obvious that the biart. VSA can generate higher
sti?nesses with two more built-in springs, the focus in
thispaperismoreonthequalityratherthanthequantity

conclude that a K

an expected load with unknown impact direction [31].
As Hogan discussed in [29] a mechanism without biart.
coupling will never be able to achieve ideal isotropy at
the endpoint, and with biart. coupling only in a limited
space of an elbow angle larger than 90

. The condition shows that the joint
sti?ness of the biart. coupling must be twice the sti?ness
of the mon.art. shoulder actuator to achieve isotropy
at the endpoint. This condition is somewhat similar to
the fact that the biart. muscles in the human arm are
much stronger compared to the mon.art. muscles. On the
other hand, a large K
shape
can be desirable in reaching
movements with a perpendicular instable force ﬁeld [32],
where high sti?ness is required in the direction of the
unstable force ﬁeld and low sti?ness in the direction of

it can be concluded that a wide range for K

with a
minimum close to 1 is desirable.
In Fig. 6 the distribution of K
shape
of the reachable
Cartesian sti?ness combinations for both actuator types
is depicted in form of a histogram showing how often
which K
shape
can be reached by either mechanism. It
shows that the minimum K
shape
that can be reached by
the mechanism with biart. coupling is 4.2 and without
5.8. Additionally, the mechanism with biart. coupling
can reach values up to 29.0 while the mon.art. system
has an upper limit of 25.1. The minimum K

of the
mon.art. VSA is also its most often occurringK

coupling is provided a K

Further analysis showed that the minimumK

of the
biart. VSA remains the same even if the Cartesian space
is not limited to the mon.art. sti?ness. Nevertheless, in
the proposed biart. mechanism we want to be able to
use the same springs for both, for the mon.art. actuators
as well as for the biart., leading to a minimum K
shape
unequal to 1.

by the pretension y

the mon.art. springs. This pretension causes a positive
shift in the sti?ness r

in a way that the
di?erence between r

decreases. As a result
the orientation of the sti?ness ellipse changes. Thus, if
it is favoured to reach also the higher orientations, the
pretension of the biart. springs had to be reduced, but
it has to be considered that these larger orientations
usually belong to a high K
shape
(extremely elongated
sti?ness ellipse).
V. Discussion and Conclusion
In this work we proposed a mechanism of a VSA with
biart. coupling. As the biart. mechanism is based on
BAVS principle, which we introduced in [16], the system
is able to independently change endpoint sti?ness and
position. Furthermore, a change in mon.art. sti?ness will
not lead to a change in biart. sti?ness and vice versa,
thus giving more control stability.
In our simulation study we investigated how a system
with vs. without biart. coupling can reach a range of
Cartesian endpoint sti?nesses. To this end, we used a
method to plot a multiple set of sti?ness conﬁgurations
described in [30] to compare di?erent planar VSA mech-
anisms. With respect to sti?ness reachability, we found
that biart. coupling considerably extends the system
capabilities by a 70-fold improvement in versatility and
can therefore be strongly favoured over mon.art. ones.
The range of orientations and shapes of Cartesian
endpoint sti?ness ellipses that the proposed biart. ac-
tuator can reach is slightly larger than that of the purely
mon.art. system. Additionally, with 39.2
?
it is larger
than found in humans studies at 30
?
[33], [34], [35].
Interestingly, we found that the mon.art. mechanism
reachessti?nesscombinationsthatthebiart.VSAcannot
reach; this can be explained by the pretension of the
biart. springs.
It has to be acknowledged that more complex prin-
ciples can enrich biart. manipulator behaviour. For in-
stance, allowing to preload the biart. actuator against a
mon.art. one, leading to non-symmetric co-contraction.
Furthermore, if the system has been designed such that
the strength of the biart. springs is twice the strength
of the mon.art. ones, endpoint sti?ness isotropy can be
achieved. This can be helpful to absorb the energy of an
expected load with unknown impact direction. However,
in order to compare both actuator types equally and to
keep the extensive calculation simple, we refrained from
these possibilities.
As already stated in the introduction, the design nei-
ther requires the use of pneumatic artiﬁcial muscles nor
tendon-coupling, which can be an advantage if one aims
to avoid non-linearities due to tendon creeping, com-
pressibility of air, and hysteresis e?ects of viscoelastic
materials.Conversely,wecannotclaimthatourapproach
is universally optimal; for instance, in comparison to
tendon driven systems it increases inertia at the drive
side of the joint.
Suitable applications for this actuator are primarily
humanoid robotics, in particular in constructing ver-
satile arms and legs, but the approach is also useful
for industrial robotics. As we initially stated, the biart.
coupling will stabilise the locomotion system obtain-
ing inherent mechanical stability, thus simplifying the
control problem. Furthermore, the possibility to trans-
fer energy between joints can be used to reduce the
amount of required energy during highly dynamic tasks;
the increased sti?ness range allows the system assume
bandwidth-dependentoptimalsti?ness.Thisisusefulfor,
e.g., switching between running and walking gaits or in a
pick-and-place task. On the other hand, the wide range
of sti?nesses allows the system to be highly precise in
a static positioning tasks, by being sti? in one direction
and ﬂexible in another.
Finally, it has to be acknowledged that the biart.
coupling leads to mechanical complexity. The additional
gears and motors introduce more backlash, tolerances,
and friction issues. Implementing 6 motors for a planar
2-DoF movement seems like a mechanical overkill. Thus,
in future work we want to address di?erent underactu-
ated versions of the proposed actuator and optimise the
sti?ness ratios in mon.art. as well as for the biart. actu-
ators, e.g., with respect to ranges of Cartesian endpoint
sti?ness ellipse orientations and shapes and with respect
to its isotropy.
