AbstractÑThis paper proposes a novel method to estimate
relative poses for a calibrated stereo camera. Three correspond-
ing points in 3D space are theoretically required to recover
unconstraint motion which has six degrees of freedom. The
proposed method solves this problem with only two 3D points
by exploiting a common reference direction between poses.
Two points are selected in accordance with the distance to
the camera: one distant point is used for deriving a reference
direction, and one near point is used for estimating accurate
translation. The distance is computed by triangulation in stereo
vision. The uncertainty of triangulation can be mitigated by the
appropriate selection strategy. The experiments using synthetic
and real data demonstrate the effectiveness and higher stability
of the proposed method against image pixel noise.
I. INTRODUCTION
This paper describes an efÞcient solution to the relative
pose problem using two image point correspondences in two
stereo views. The relative pose problem is one of the major
problems in a number of Þelds, including computer vision,
photogrammetry, robotics, augmented reality, etc. This paper
assumes a stereo camera rig in an open outdoor environment,
which can be applied to SLAM (Simultaneous Localization
and Mapping) and VO (visual odometry).

problem difÞcult, e.g., moving objects, occlusions, illumina-
tion changes, and image noise. The RANSAC [1] has been
established as a standard method for outlier removal. It is a
hypothesis-and-test framework which produces hypotheses
with randomly sampled data sets and selects the hypoth-
esis that acquires highest consensus with other data. It is
important to Þnd the minimal number of data points which
can estimate model parameters, since the required number of
iterative operations is exponential in the number of necessary
data points [1], [2].
Several attempts have been performed to Þnd the minimal
solverfortherelativeposeproblem.Foramonocularcamera,
the minimal number of recovering motion parameters is Þve
[3], [4]. It has been reduced by adding cues for the orienta-
tion. Naroditsky et al. [5] proposed a three-plus-one (four)
algorithm by exploiting a point at inÞnity. They formulate
a close-form solution and a solution using action matrix.

on the formulation of the Þve-point algorithm [3]. They
resolve two orientational angles with inertia measurements.
Kalantari et al. [7] also showed a three-point algorithm
with different formulation using Gr¬ obner basis. They used
inertial measurements or a vertical vanishing point to reduce
the number of motion parameters. Kneip et al. [8] further
reduced it to two, by computing full rotation matrix from an
IMU rigidly attached to the camera. A single-point algorithm
was proposed by Scaramuzza [2] for a planar motion of a
nonholonomic wheeled vehicle. These monocular methods
can also be applied for a stereo camera.
For a stereo camera, three correspondences are required to
recover motion parameters. The solvers may be divided into
two approaches. The 3D-to-2D methods use the correspon-
dences between 3D space points and 2D image points. These
methods are often referred as the perspective-three-point
(P3P) solvers [1], [9], [10]. The 3D-to-3D methods compute
poses using 3D space point correspondences. The solution
can be obtained algebraically by least squares [11], [12]
and weighted least squares [13], or solved by optimization
procedure [14]. The number of data points can be reduced by
exploitingtheprojectivegeometry.Theone-pointsolverfora
stereorigisproposedbyNiandDellaert[14],whichresolves
the camera orientation using the inÞnite homography. Their
follow-up work in [15] solves the orientation using two
distant points and the translation using one near points.
Recent approaches for reducing the number of data points
are summarized in TableI. A major approach to reduce
the number of data points is to use common directional
references between two camera poses. The directional cor-
respondences are often computed by inertial measurements
or points at inÞnity. However, such measurements are not
always available particularly for off-road vehicles in an
outdoor environment. The inertial measurements may be
unstable for running vehicle on uneven terrain, and vanishing
points are hard to be found on environments without man-
made objects.
This paper proposes a new scheme to use two correspond-
ing points, instead of three, obtained from a stereo camera
rig. It estimates the orientation and translation separately,
similar to [14], [15]. This strategy can greatly improve the
computational efÞciency. The two corresponding points are
selected in accordance with the distance to the camera. One
corresponding point is a distant point used for orientation
estimation. As demonstrated in [5], the points which are
sufÞciently far can be used as reference direction. While
[5] uses the RANSAC to select distant points, the proposed
method simply uses stereo triangulation to know the depths

of points. The other corresponding point is a near point used
for translation estimation. Near space points are accurately
triangulated and therefore less uncertain. A single point in
3D space is sufÞcient to recover a translational motion with
known camera orientation.
The proposed two-point method is quantitatively evaluated
through the experiments with synthetic and real data. The
impact of distance for the accuracy of pose estimation is
studied. The proposed method outperformed other methods
in noisy situation which often appears in outdoor Þelds.
II. STEREO CAMERA MODELS
To understand the error model in stereo vision, the geom-
etry of stereo camera is reviewed in this section.
A. Front-Parallel ConÞguration
A standard conÞguration of stereo cameras is using two
horizontally displaced cameras viewing the same direction
(Fig.1).Thecamerasarecalibrated,i.e.,withknownintrinsic
and extrinsic parameters, which together form a projection
matrix P. The position of a pointX ?R
3
is estimated by
the triangulation using two set of projected pointsu
L
,u
R

. The ideal case of this speciÞc conÞguration derives the
simple stereo equations

? ? u

f
? ? (1)
where b denotes the length of the baseline, f denotes the
focal length of cameras, and d = u
L
? u
R
denotes the
disparity of a projected feature point. However, the presence
of noise complicates the problem. Under the noisy situation,
two rays from the cameras are not guaranteed to cross,
thus the stereo equations do not hold. Several methods have
tackled with this problem, some of which can be found in
[16].Acommonmethodisthelineartriangulationalgorithm.
In this paper, the Linear-LS (Least Square) method is used
which is fast to compute and afÞne-invariant.

B. Range Uncertainty and Statistical Bias
The accuracy of motion estimation is degraded by the
range estimation uncertainty derived from triangulation [17].
The uncertainty grows larger along the depth direction.
A study has conducted to reveal how the pixel uncertainty
of feature detectors (e.g. corner detectors) translates into the
range estimation uncertainty in long-range stereo measure-
ments [18]. The pixel uncertainty is commonly modeled as a
gaussian distribution [18], [19]. As one can see in Fig.1, the
pixel uncertainty in an image direction forms a quadrilateral
uncertainty in 3D space (gray region). Analytically, this
can be shown in Fig.2 as the range probability density
function. Note that the range uncertainty derived from the
pixel uncertainty has a heavy-tailed distribution. Supposing
the Gaussian uncertainty in pixels, the range uncertainty can
be modeled as

where µ

and ?
d
denotes the mean and standard deviation
of disparity measurements. The numerical analysis in [18]
shows that the mean of (2) statistically overestimates the
true mean due to the heavy tail. Such uncertainty increases
as a strong function of range and the bias does as well.
As discussed in [20], this range measurement bias has a
strong inßuence on motion estimation. Their experimental
result claims that the improper selection of feature points
may cause the bias error in motion estimation. A bias
reduction scheme is proposed in [18] based on Taylor series
expansion of (1) under the assumption that the variation of
disparity measurements around the true value is small.
The proposed method, however, does not compensate the
bias errors. Rather, it selects points in a proper way so that
the motion estimation error can be reduced. The idea is to

uncertaininlocationbuthasnon-biasedGaussiandistribution
in direction. The translation is estimated with a near point
which is accurately triangulated in 3D space.
III. RELATIVE POSE ESTIMATION
The mathematical formulation of the relative pose solver
is described in this section. The solution mentioned here uses
only two point correspondences. The key technique is esti-
mating two rotation angles using an approximated reference
direction derived from a distant point correspondence, and
three translation parameters and the rest one rotation angle
from a near point correspondence.

as

to cross, compute the midpoint of two rays given by

For realizing efÞcient computation, let us deÞne the in-
termediate frame F

has the same origin
with F

, and its z-axis is aligned with d

C. Recovering One Angle and Three Translation Parameters
from a Near Correspondence
Next, the remaining parameters are solved by a near point
correspondence. In (3), the triangulation uncertainty N(z)
can be negligible where the point is close to the camera.
Thus, the translation is computed as

not cause big problems in most real world cases. See the
numerical accuracy in the simulation.

Now,solveforcandsusing(14)and(15).Thesequadratic

for ?, which means all unknowns are solved. The relative

D. Extension to Over-determined Case
The method can be extended to the over-determined case,
where more than two point correspondences can be obtained,
by returning least squares solution.
In the step of orientation estimation, two corresponding
common directions disambiguates the parameter ?, and thus
uniquely determines the orientation. In the case of more than
two correspondences, the solution can be obtained by the
classic least squares Þtting [11].
The least squares solution for the translation parameters is
givenby replacingX in (11) with mean vector

It will be shown in the experiments that the stability and
accuracy are improved by adding extra points.
E. Thresholds
In the proposed algorithm, there are two distances to be
concerned: the thresholds for distant and near. The simple
model of orientation error is depicted in Fig.6. The two
reference vectors are ideally parallel. However, if the point is
at Þnite distance, the vectors form an acute-angled triangle.
The orientation error ?

(21)
On the other hand, the threshold for near points is given
by several tangled factors: the location uncertainty, the
directional error in (20), and the triangulation bias derived
from (2). Under the assumption ofz>>b, the location
uncertainty is formulated as

IV. SIMULATION STUDY
The proposed two-point algorithm is studied using syn-
thetic data. The numerical accuracy and stability are statis-
tically evaluated in comparison with three-point methods.
A. Setup
In the simulation, reference points in the 3D space are
randomly generated within a visible range of cuboid. Con-
sidering the properties of camera projection and feature point
extraction, the distribution of points is clearly the function
of distance. A heavy-tailed distribution is assumed in this
simulation through observation of real outdoor data. The
points are then projected into 1024? 768 (XGA) image
planes using the camera pose and camera parameters. Some
oftheprojectedpointsareeliminatedwiththenon-maximum
suppression. The image points are perturbed by pixel noise,
modeled by zero-mean Gaussian distribution with the stan-
dard deviation ?
p
which is speciÞed in the experiments. One
hundred points are generated for each camera pose.
The camera poses are synthetically generated assuming
general outdoor vehicles. The translation of the camera
system is speciÞed by unit vectors for forward and sideways
motion. The orientation of the camera system is randomly
1045
generated within reasonable bounds. The focal length is set
to 900 and the principal point to the center of the image.
The baseline of the stereo camera is set to 0.85.
B. Distance vs Estimation Accuracy
Firstly, the impact of distance against estimation accuracy
is studied. The orientation estimation is evaluated by the
smallest rotation angle of relative rotation between the true
and estimate orientation. The translation estimation is evalu-
ated by the euclidean distance between the true and estimate
position.
The distant points at inÞnity, i.e., vanishing points, are not
alwaysavailableinnaturalscenes.Theimpactofusingpoints
at Þnite distance is shown in Fig.7. The error decreases
exponentially within the bound given by (21). Therefore,
the rotation error can be suppressed given a certain level
of estimation accuracy.
On the other hand, the near points should be close to the
camera to suppress the growing triangulation uncertainty.
The translation error with respect to the distance of near
points is shown in Fig.7. This simulation uses a Þxed distant
point locating at 100m distance (=7.65pixel). The error for
most data points increases linearly, while the upper bound is
given by the exponential function. It is important to choose
sufÞciently near points for better accuracy.
In the later experiments, the thresholds are set to 10 to
40m for near points and >100m for distant points as is
otherwise stated.
C. Numerical Stability
The proposed algorithm can be adopted for overdeter-
mined cases. The number of points greater than two can
exhibit higher stability in numeric accuracy. Fig.8 shows the
numerical stability of the method with respect to the number
of near point correspondences for four different noise levels.
The error metric is the Frobenius norm of the estimated and
true pose matrices over 10
5
trials.
The straightforward result suggests using more points

[10]. Due to the instability of the 3D-to-3D estimation, it
uses four points instead of three.
The rotation and translation errors for forward and side-
ways motion are shown in Fig.9. Each plot represents the
medians over 1000 trials for each noise level. The reason to
use the median is that the fraction of good estimates is more
important in the RANSAC framework.
Due to the approximation of directional correspondences,
the consistent error can be observed in both of the mo-
tions. However, it is clearly seen that the proposed method
performs stably against the increasing levels of pixel noise
compared to the other methods. SpeciÞcally, the proposed
method outperforms other methods in translation estimation,
while it requires less point correspondences.
The reason that the proposed method performs better
against pixel noise is that it avoids triangulation uncertainty
of distant points. While other methods can also avoid this

V. EXPERIMENTS
The proposed two-point algorithm is evaluated with the
real dataset taken at a volcanic Þeld. A stereo camera rig,
whichprovides 1024?768grayscaleimagepairs,ismounted
on a four-wheeled vehicle robot. Sample images are shown
in Fig.10.
The algorithm is compared with [11] and [9], all of which
are implemented in C++. The trajectories are estimated in
Fig.11 along a 40m drive on a circular path. The motion
is estimated within the RANSAC framework. The two-
point algorithm successfully recovers a circular path while it
contains small ßuctuation in yaw direction. The ßuctuation
is derived from the approximation using points at Þnite
distance. Even so, this formulation recovers trajectory with
sufÞcientlysmallRMSerrorandtime(TableII).Theremain-
ing error can be eliminated with the optimization procedure

This paper proposes an efÞcient method to solve the rela-
tive pose problem using only two corresponding 3D points.
It gives up to two solutions using one reference direction
from a distant point correspondence and one near point
correspondence. The experiments using synthetic data show
higherstabilityagainstimagepixelnoise,whichmaybeabig
problem in real world systems. Furthermore, the algorithm
successfully recovers the path from a real video sequence
by an outdoor vehicle. This high-speed relative pose solver
is suitable for a hypotheses generator of RANSAC systems,
which are widely used in robotic localization applications.
