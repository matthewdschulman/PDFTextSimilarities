AbstractÑThis paper presents a novel six-legged parallel 
robot, the kinematic model of which is simpler than that of the 
simplest six-axis serial robot. The new robot is the 6-DOF 
extension of the Cartesian parallel robot. It consists of three 
pairs of base-mounted prismatic actuators, the directions in 
each pair parallel to one of the axes of a Cartesian coordinate 
system. In each of the six legs, there are also two passive 
revolute joints, the axes of which are parallel to the direction of 
the prismatic joint. Finally, each leg is attached to the mobile 
platform via a spherical joint. The direct kinematics of the 
novel parallel robot can be solved easily by partitioning the 
orientation and the position of the mobile platform. There are 
eight distinct solutions, which can be found directly by solving a 
linear system and alternating the signs of three radicals. This 
parallel robot has a large workspace and is suitable for 
machining or rapid prototyping, as detailed in this paper. 
Keywords: Cartesian parallel robot, direct kinematics, 
singularities, rapid prototyping. 
 
I. INTRODUCTION 
The invention of the Cartesian parallel robot [1], also 
known as the Tripteron (Fig. 1), in 2001 (see [2] for more 
details), was a key turning point in the theory of parallel 
mechanisms. Different designs of parallel robots had been 
known for decades, but none as simple as the Cartesian 
parallel robot, the kinematic model of which resumes to

where 
1
? , 
2
? , and 
3
? are the active-joint variables, and x, y, 
and z are the position coordinates of the mobile platform. 
Later, the concept was extended to 4 DOFs (degrees of 
freedom) with the four-legged Quadrupteron robot [4], but 
the kinematic model of the latter is no more linear. Its direct 
kinematics problem requires the solution of a quadratic 
equation. Later, the Tripteron concept was extended to 
5 DOFs with the five-legged Pentapteron [5,6]. Its forward 
kinematics, however, boils down to solving a polynomial of 
degree 1680, and allows at least 208 real solutions [7]. 
Extending the concept of the simplest parallel robot to 5 
DOFs yielded one of the most complex parallel robots. 
We present in this article the 6-DOF missing member of 
the so-called Multipteron family. Contrary to expectations, 
the kinematic model of the Hexapteron, as we call it, is not 
complex. In fact, it is simpler than the kinematic model of the 
simplest 6-DOF serial robot. Furthermore, the Hexapteron 
can have a fairly large workspace, if properly designed.

geometric design and solve its inverse and direct kinematics. 
Then, in Section III, we find its singularity loci and discuss 
its workspace. Section IV presents the mechanical design of a 
3D printing device based on the Hexapteron architecture. 
Finally, we present our conclusions in Section V. 
II. KINEMATIC MODELING OF THE HEXAPTERON 
The Hexapteron consists of six legs, each composed of a 
cylindrical joint, a revolute joint, and a spherical joint, 
arranged orthogonally as shown in Fig. 2, where O-xyz is the 
base reference frame and C-x«y«z« is the mobile reference 
frame. In each leg, the axes of the two passive revolute joints 
are parallel to the direction of the actuated prismatic joint.

There are other arrangements of the platform joints that lead 
to mechanisms with kinematic models of similar simplicity, 
but this arrangement seems to lead to larger workspace. Also, 
note that at zero orientation (when the orientations of the 
mobile frame and the base frame are the same), each pair of 
adjacent legs would interfere, unless they are designed with 
an offset or curved, as illustrated in Fig. 2. This offset, 
however, does not change the kinematics of the mechanism, 
since each active joint variable ?
i
 will be defined as the 
distance between B
i
 and the plane passing through O and 
normal to the direction of actuator i. 
Thus, the kinematic model of the Hexapteron is 
represented by the following six simple equations:

x yz ? p is the position vector of point C with

matrix representing the orientation of the mobile frame with 
respect to the base frame, and i, j, and k are the unit vectors 
along, respectively, the x, y, and z axis of the base frame. 
Equations (3Ð8) represent the solution of the inverse 
kinematics of the Hexapteron. Obviously, there is only one 
solution per leg, and serial singularities occur whenever a leg 
is fully stretched or fully folded. 
In order to solve the direct kinematics, we need to 
manipulate (3Ð8), but first we need to choose a particular 
orientation representation. As usual, some orientation 
representations make the direct kinematics more difficult to 
solve, while others lead to elegant solutions. For example, 
among all Euler angles conventions, only the ZYX fixed 
angle set leads to relatively compact direct kinematic 
equations. However, we will use Euler parameters, since the 
resulting direct kinematic equations are even more compact 
and symmetric. 
Based on Euler parameters, the rotation matrix is 
expressed as follows:

Next, we will get rid of the position coordinates by

There are different avenues for solving (10Ð13), including 
the use of Gršbner basis, but the following approach is by far 
the most elegant one. We obtain four new equations by 
? subtracting (12) and (13) from the sum of (10) and (11); 
? subtracting (11) and (13) from the sum of (10) and (12); 
? subtracting (11) and (12) from the sum of (10) and (13); 
? adding (10), (11), (12) and (13).

Of course, the direct kinematics of the Hexapteron will have 
a solution only if the right hand side of each of the above four 
equations is nonnegative. 
In order to solve (14Ð17), we take the square roots on 
each side, which yields the following system of four linear

presented in Table 1 (legs not shown). 
It is important to note that the direct kinematics of the 
Hexapteron is a special case of the six-points-on-six-planes 
problem studied in [8] and, to a certain extent, in [9]. Indeed, 
the author of [8] essentially proved that the direct kinematics 
of a Hexapteron in which the spatial arrangement of the six 
platform joints and the directions of the actuated prismatic 
joints are arbitrary is equivalent to solving a univariate 
polynomial of degree 8. Thus, what is particularly interesting 
about our Hexapteron is that each of its eight direct kinematic 
solutions can be obtained directly, without solving any 
polynomial. What is even more important is that we can 
select which assembly mode we are interested in and 
calculate the corresponding unique direct kinematic solution, 
as done in [10] for the Agile Eye, by specifying ?

Of course, the Hexapteron is not the only 6-DOF parallel 
robot with trivial direct kinematics. However, virtually all 
other such parallel mechanisms are either three legged (e.g., 
[11Ð13]) or asymmetrical (e.g., [14Ð15]) or require double or 
triple spherical joints (e.g., [15]). 
III. SINGULARITIES AND WORKSPACE OF THE HEXAPTERON 
As already mentioned, the Hexapteron is at a serial 
singularity whenever one of its six legs is fully stretched or 
fully folded (i.e., when in a leg, the center of the spherical 
joint is coplanar with the axes of the two passive revolute 
joints). In order to find the parallel singularities, we should 
obtain the Jacobian matrix and examine the conditions that 
lead to zeroing of its determinant. 
Skipping the derivations, the Jacobian matrix of the 
Hexapteron is

The determinant of this matrix is

which means that the Hexapteron is at a parallel singularity 
whenever Q
j
 = 0, i.e., whenever ?
j
 = 0 (j = 1, 2, 3, 4). 
Fig. 4 shows that the four planes ?

the

that pyramid is the allowable space, where ?
 j
 > 0 (j = 1, 2, 3, 
4), i.e., where the Hexapteron has eight assembly modes.

Now, even though the Hexapteron is a 6-DOF 
mechanism, we are mostly interested in its 5-axis capabilities, 
or more specifically in the maximum tilt angles that it can 
achieve. It is easy to show that the angle between the z« axis 
of the mobile frame and the z axis and the base frame is 
? ?? cos
?1
cos? cos?
??
?? ?????
Clearly, ? should always remain in the open range 
(?90¡, 90¡) to avoid parallel singularities. Similarly, it is 
possible to show that ? should also always remain in the open 
range (?90¡, 90¡) to avoid parallel singularities. Therefore, in 
theory, the maximum tilt angle of the mobile platform can be 
anything below 90¡.  
As for the position workspace, as shown in [2], if the legs 
are sufficiently long, the only theoretical limits are the 
strokes of the actuators. In practice, however, the main limits 
(particularly for the orientation workspace) are the 
interferences between the legs. Since these legs must have 
complex curved shapes in order to reduce interferences, it is 
very difficult to compute the workspace of the real 
Hexapteron. 
IV. MECHANICAL DESIGN OF A HEXAPTERON FOR 3D 
PRINTING 
Fused deposition modeling (FDM) of plastics typically 
limits the overhang of individual layers to less than 45¡.  
Models requiring overhangs greater than this need printed 
support structures to prevent unintended part deformation.  
Yet, 3D printers have been shown to print upside down and 
in zero-gravity indicating that the 45¡ limit is from the 
normal of the layer instead of from the gravity vector. 
The vast majority of 3D printers are 3-DOF robots 
(Cartesian serial robots or Delta parallel robots [16]) and 
typically print in planar layers perpendicular to gravity. The 
additional DOFs of the Hexapteron allow for unconventional 
printing of curved and tilted layers. Software will need to be 
written that will produce layers that intersect the surface of a 
model at ±45¡ from its normal. This will allow FDM to 
produce models with negative overhangs that previously 
required techniques such as selective laser sintering. 
Additionally, 3D printers have been required to print on 
planar surfaces. The possibility for curved and tilted layers 
will allow for printing directly on non-planar object. For 
instance, it would be possible to print a plastic handhold 
around the small bar on a dumbbell. Previously, this would 
have been impossible without disassembly of the dumbbell. 
The mechanical design of the Hexapteron (Fig. 5) took 
advantage of the systemÕs symmetry. Most parts are made in 
triple, including laser cut plates from aluminum, and the 
even- and odd-numbered legs, also machined from 
aluminum. The extremities of each leg, which provide the 
offsets necessary to reduce collisions, are made of steel 
(Fig. 6). All revolute joints are mounted on ball bearings. 
Finally, each of the six platform joints is made of a Cardan 
joint with two revolute joints on each side. This redundancy 
increases significantly the range of the joints as shown in 
Fig. 6, while avoiding a gimbal lock.

Figure 5.  Mechanical design of the Hexapteron under construction. 
 
Figure 6.  A closeup of the mobile platform at an extreme orientation. 
For actuation, six NEMA23 step motors with maximal 
torque of 1.9 Nm are used. Movement to the carriages 
(machined from aluminum) is transmitted through three 
500 mm ? 20 mm linear rails and six 16 mm ball screws 
with 10 mm pitch. The overall dimensions of the machine 
are about 750 mm ? 750 mm ? 750 mm. 
Finally, the mobile platform, also machined from 
aluminum, is equipped with a hot end that heats up to about 
185¡C as 1.75 mm filament is pressed into it. The nozzle of 
the hot end is of diameter 0.4 mm. Not pictured in Figs. 5 
and 6 is an FEP Teflon tube (i.e., a Bowden tube) that runs 
from the top of the mobile platform to a remote filament 
drive, also not pictured. Eventually, a gripper can be 
incorporated into the mobile platform to allow for automated 
assembly of printed parts and part removal. 
Initial simulations show the mobile platform can tilt up to 
about 45¡ in any direction (Fig. 6). However, after analyzing 
the first two prototypes that are currently being machined, 
the mechanical design will be optimized in order to allow 
greater tilt angles. 
V. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK 
Among all parallel robots with six identical legs, the 
Hexapteron is probably the one with simplest kinematic 
model. Naturally, this first paper focused mainly on solving 
the direct kinematics of the Hexapteron and studying its 
singularities. Next, its mechanical design will be optimized 
to allow the largest possible tilt angle in any direction. The 
redundant rotational DOF about the z« should, however, be 
taken into account. Finally, the potential for using the 
Hexapteron design for building a machine tool will also be 
explored. Although we have not yet performed detailed 
workspace analyses for any particular actual prototype, there 
is no doubt that the Hexapteron has a larger workspace than 
any other hexapod system.
