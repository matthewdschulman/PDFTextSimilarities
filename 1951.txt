Distributed Robotic Sampling of Non-homogeneous Spatio-
Temporal Fields via Recursive Geometric Sub-division
Young-Ho Kim and Dylan A. Shell
AbstractÑ Environmental monitoring, an important appli-
cation for robots, has begun to be addressed recently with
linear least squares regression techniques because they estimate
the values of measured attributes and their uncertainty. But
several challenges remain when performing adaptive sampling
in a communication-constrained distributed multi-robot setting.
When the attributes of interest evolve over time (as is natural for
many environments) any non-homogeneous spatial variability
may necessitate continual re-modeling of the Þeld dynamics
and/or re-sampling of the Þeld. This raises questions about
the robotsÕ division of labor and workload balance that can
be difÞcult to address when sample information is not stored
centrally. This paper tackles these coordination problems ef-
Þciently by introducing a sub-division-based modeling tech-
nique appropriate for distributed decision-making. We augment
Ordinary Kriging to enable representation of a ÞeldÕs (poten-
tially non-homogeneous) evolution through Bayes Þltering that
characterize the underlying dynamics. This approach not only
enables adaptive path planning in the Þeld, but the sub-divided
areas lead to a straightforward formulation of the optimal
workload distribution through modiÞcation of an approximate
graph partitioning algorithm. Using a simulated multi-robot
sampling scenario, we demonstrate and validate the approach.
The experiments show good performance in terms of cross-
validation using real values and illustrate how hotspots are
identiÞed and modeled, in turn affecting the division of labor.
I. INTRODUCTION
Environmental monitoring with robots encompasses a
wide range of important applications [1], [2]; for example,
a large-scale lake monitoring effort may help to detect
contamination and help ensure the safety of the water.
Recent research has made signiÞcant progress in predicting,
monitoring, and tracking large scalar Þelds; including exper-
imental work in aquatic, terrestrial, and subsoil settings [3]Ð
[5]. The underlying challenge addressed by such systems
stems from the measured data being sparse compared to
the large spatial areas/volumes of interest. Although these
problems are a natural Þt for multi-robot systems, models
that can scale to large Þelds, while being sufÞciently rich
to capture aspects of temporal variability and avoiding the
proliferation of tuning parameters, give inadequate attention
to practical considerations needed for distributed planning
and decision-making.
In the context of multi-robot adaptive sampling, this paper
considers two problems: (i) how does one model a non-
homogeneous time-varying Þeld efÞciently? (ii) how does
one distribute the robotsÕ workloads (since a changing Þeld
may require non-homogeneous sample densities)? The ma-
jority of research, including recent work (e.g., [6]), focuses
on the Þrst problem in isolation. In this paper, we consider

Science and Engineering, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX

that an appropriate answer to Þrst problem must be consid-
ered in terms of the second problem and its context. The two
are directly related because complex, dynamic Þelds beÞt
multiple robots, each making autonomous decisions in an
online fashion.
This paper represents temporal dynamics as uncertainty
that is accrued with time. The rate of growth of this uncer-
tainty is estimated, simplifying the covariance (or variogram)
model, and reducing the complexity needed to treat the
relationship between space and time. This is a pessimistic
view born of the observation that treating data as out of date
is usually more practical than Þtting high-order non-linear
models, especially given comparatively few samples. The
method we propose incorporates a Bayesian Þlter to track
this rate of growth of the Þeld.
Non-homogeneity is captured by repeatedly dividing the
Þeld representation in a recursive manner, while maintaining
the continuity of the Þeld estimate (although, potentially
sacriÞcing it in the uncertainty estimate). These sub-divided
regions become units for assigning sampling tasks to each of
the robots so as to balance the total workload. The division
operation may cause the transfer of a region from one robot
to another in its local vicinity; only summary information
ever need be transferred between robots.
SpeciÞcally, the work contributes:
 An efÞcient recursive geometric sub-division of the Þeld
to balance and distribute the multi-robot workload.
 A simple uniÞed Ordinary Kriging formulation that explic-
itly integrates a time-based relationship into the interpola-
torÕs uncertainty for Þelds undergoing temporal evolution.
 A novel probabilistic Þltering to update the environmental
model to estimate non-homogeneous Þeld dynamics.
II. RELATED WORK
Linear least-squares estimation methods have been suc-
cessfully employed in robotics for spatial interpolation and
regional sampling. By way of recent examples, we mention
work of Singh et al. [7] in the Gaussian Process Regression
(GPR) framework, and Zhu et al. [8] via Kriging interpola-
tion. Both use equivalent minimum error-variance estimation
techniques that permit measured data to be interpolated in
a way that takes into account a statistical description of a
spatial variogram or covariance.
Employing these techniques to the model both spatial and
temporal variability is a classical problem [9]. Singh et al. [7]
used variations of these models with either stationary or non-
stationary, and separable or non-separable spatial temporal
covariance functions. However, these have many parameters,
which are difÞcult to provide estimates (or even priors) for

and may need to adapt over time. Ultimately, the changing
Þeld is likely to be spatially non-homogeneous.
Several researchers are working on adaptive path planning
in dynamic Þelds. Their solutions, however, involve a given
(and Þxed) covariance, augmented with other adhoc models.
For example, Williams and Sukhatme [2] model the spatial
dependency but add a plume-like process to generate a path
that tracks the gradient. Recently, Smith N. et al. [1] employ
an ocean phenomena forecast model.
Non-homogeneous temporal variability was recently tack-
led by [6], which is the closest work to the present paper.
However, in contrast to the preceding work, our method
decouples the spatial structure (captured via a purely spatial
variogram) from temporal structure, where parameters model
the latter change at a different time-scale to the former.
This simpliÞed representation facilitates efÞcient multi-robot
communication. This is important because distributed multi-
robot systems are a natural Þt to adaptive sampling problems.
We emphasize that our approach computes paths online
on the basis of newly observed variability (in contrast to
[10]). Also, the workload calculation only requires sharing
of a local model of the neighborhoodÕs dynamics. This
reduces communication overhead compared with recent work
in decentralized active sampling with a broadcast model [11].
III. PRELIMINARIES & PROPOSED ESTIMATOR
In this section, we brießy describe Kriging [9] as a prelim-
inary step, and then we present the proposed estimator for
time varying scalar Þelds. Let R

represent the spatial
domain of interest, and let TR
+
represent time.
A. Ordinary kriging estimator
We use the Ordinary Kriging (OK) estimator [9] to make
inferences on an unobserved value of the random process

is an unknown spatial location andx

The OK estimator makes use of samples, Z(x

The spatio-temporal semi-variogram function  captures
the strength of spatial temporal relationships that represents
the statistical effect of (stationary) relationships in space
and time. However, the sorts of environmental attributes we
wish to sample may evolve differently in different locations
over time. Fixed variograms are inadequate to treat non-
homogeneous temporal variability. The Kriging Variance
(KV) 

(x

) represents the prediction uncertainty. Z

(x

)
and 
2
(x

) give the spatial prediction of unobserved values
of the random process without considering either sensing
noise or position uncertainty [9]. Our former work [5] shows
(a) The robot maintains several temporal models each of which is
weighted and ultimately fused. Left: The robot traverses the Þeld and
makes measurements at different times. Right: A prediction from the
Þeld ( with varianceKV

) is used to update weights via BayesÕ rule
and new observation (labeled Truth Sampling).
(b) Illustration of differently weighted models of temporal evolution.
The increasing size of a circle over time shows the degree of temporal
variability of each

, and how this is captured in the histogram of
~ , where the X-axis are scales Õs and the Y-axis are weights !Õs.
Fields may be split or merged. The propagated rates (the histograms)
are different in each region.
(c) Workload balancing in the multi-robot system via approximate graph
partitioning. Left: Initially the robots have evenly separated regions. The
Þeld is updated as above in (a). Middle: Each robot constructs the as-
sociated sub-division graph. Right: An approximate algorithm facilitates
the movement regions between robots to balance the total workload.

the explicitly separated sensing error from the variogram that
was ignored before.
B. A measurement noise interpretation and estimation
To deal and simplify with spatial temporal Þelds, we model
the passage of time as increasing error in the estimated
values. A sample taken a long time ago is treated as if
it involved signiÞcant measurement error by building on
our earlier work in [5]. We add a function of time to
the measurement error in order to represent the effect of
changes in the Þeld at the sample location that may have
occurred since the measurement was made. The KV is used
as an indication for the potential usefulness of sampling
at a particular location. When time is incorporated in our
proposed approach, it affords a natural way to include data
staleness as part of that utility computation.
The simplicity of the method comes from the fact that
Gaussian noise as a measurement error, is additive in the OK.
The resultant variogram is  = 
Y
+ (
2
i
+
2
j
)=2, where

Y
is the basic variogram. Since most robotics work employs
558
formulations lacking such a treatment (cf. [7]), the derivation
appears in the on-line supplemental material [12]. This shows
a modiÞed OK framework with different measurement errors.
Let t
i
and t
j
be the time elapsed since measuring
at x

and x
j
, respectively, where x

gest a propagated linear function of time, N(0;~ t

) and
N(0;~ t

), where ~  is scaling vector parameters. A set
of values (~ ;~ !) is [(

); (!
1
;:::;!
P
)], p2 [1;P ],
where
p
are temporal scale values,!
p
are the (normalized)
weights, and P is the number of the bins. We estimate
~  by on-line using a probabilistic method: a Bayesian
Þlter [13] is maintained for each scale parameter. It is natural
to visualize !
p
(
P
p=[1;P]
!
p
= 1) as vertical lines in a
histogram for each 
p
. Simply looking at this histogram
allows one to interpret the temporal behavior of a region:
when comparatively large 
p
has signiÞcant probability !
p
then the Þeld is ßuctuating signiÞcantly over time. Detailed
derivations are in [12].
Let
^
G(x;t) be a function that represents the algo-
rithmÕs output such that

IV. DISTRIBUTED ADAPTIVE SAMPLING
An overview of our approach is explained visually in
Fig. 1. There are two important steps: the Þrst step is to
model the temporal evolution of the scalar Þeld and to plan
an adaptive path, as shown in Figs. 1(a) and 1(b) explained
in Secs. IV-A and IV-B, respectively. the second step is to
distribute the sampling to multiple robots and to balance
workloads as illustrated in Fig. 1(c) explained in Sec. IV-C.
A. Estimation of adaptive Þeld dynamics
This section presents an approach for estimating the
temporal evolution in Fig. 1(a). We can compute a predic-
tion Z

(x
0
), and the variance KV
p
with regard to each
probabilistic model p. Then, the temporal variation of the
Þeld can be updated by P (!

Alg. 1 represents the Bayes Þlter posterior. Finally, we have
a distribution, (~

B. Adaptive path planning
Our path planning strategy consists of three parts: (1) sep-
aration of the regions, (2) generating queries (a set of

potential solutions) in continuous space, and (3) maximizing
a utility function to choose a solution. To better represent
temporal variability, the region  is subdivided by recur-
sively decomposing the region into four equal quadrants,
where
S

j=1

ij
= 
i
(we simply assume four even sub-
regions, which facilitate the implementation by a quad-
tree). As we subdivide the regions recursively, we have
updated K non-overlapping regions

, where i 2 [1,K].
Therefore,

which updates a temporal evolution model in Section IV-

. Based on this notation and deÞnition, we
Þnd the maximum difference of the change rate of the spatial
Þeld and then subdivide the region so that our knowledge for
each region is maximized. M

, or maintained within a
current region with regard to a new observation.
Next, we need the robotÕs next goal positionx
0
at timet.
First, We select locationx
0
from a set of samples [x

;:::;x
Q
],
whereQ is the number of potential locations. To generate the
query set in the continuous space, the idea is to distribute the
number of queries based on the importance of each region.
Since
^
G

is the expected value of the rate of change in 
i
,
we deÞne the importance of the region
i
to be proportional
to the area sizej

G

. Randomly selected query locations
are produced in subregions in Fig. 4. This implicitly captures
the notion of hotspot sampling.
Finally, we pick the next goal position as the one that
maximizes the utility function from the generated queriesx
q
,
where q2 [1;Q]. Ideally, the utility represents how much
each query minimizes

approximated as a discrete space, yielding:

queries in each Þeld based on the importance of each Þeld.
In line 19 of Alg. 2, we Þnd a potential goal position that
maximizes a utility function.
Our method picks a single point rather than generating a
whole path. When we consider an optimal path, we need
to compute all possible paths, and then evaluate each total
KV

to pick a unique path that (maximally) reduces the total
uncertainty. However, it is beneÞcial to adjust and re-plan an
on-line path when the Þeld changes over time.
C. Distributed multi-robot sampling
Regions also have an associated graphical representation.
A region  that is decomposed into K non-overlapping
regions 
1
; ;
k
; ;
K
is represented, along with the
connectivity relationships, as a graph G = (V;E), where
a vertex v
i
2V denotes the region 
k
, and an edge e
ij
=
(v
i
;v
j
) 2 E connects a pair of vertices v
i
and v
j
when
the associated regions are adjacent. Separate weights are
associated with both the vertices and edges.
With m robots, we wish to balance the workload by
the partitioning the Þeld . This is achieved by splitting
the graph G into m sub-graphs G
i
= (V;E) such that
S
m
i=1
G

=G. We expectKm, so each robot is associated
with at least one region. Although m can be any number,
for clarity of presentation, consider the two robot case, with
robot r

and r

. Let w

v
and w

denote the weights of v

WhenG
i
of robotr

has the maximum total cost andG
j
of
robot r

has the minimum total cost, i;j2 [1;m], our goal
is to minimize the difference of the total cost between G
i
and G
j
, as illustrated in Fig. 1(c).
Since the m graph partitioning problem known to be NP-
hard [14], we adopt the heuristic of [15] because of its good
performance in adjusting the unbalanced partitions as well as
its practical running speed O(n
3
). A modiÞcation is neces-
sary. We alter the formula by considering the neighborhood
cost only to move a vertex (a region) to the other robotÕs sub-
graph. Them robots initially split the regions evenly between
themselves. Each robot follows the steps in Section IV-B,
then updates its model of the temporal dynamics. The robots
communicate data about nearby regions like the size of
the region and the information describing the local Þeld
dynamics in (~

respectively.
Since the goal is to minimize the difference between the

central basin of Lake Erie that is susceptible to severe oxygen
depletion each summer [16], we verify the proposed methods
to predict the proper chlorophyll levels. In practice, such
data sets are spatially and temporally sparse. For example,
NASAÕs Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer
(MODIS [17]) gathers data daily or hourly using satellite
images with relatively low resolution that are affected by
weather conditions. Data from the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) [16] is collected by
Þxed buoys which are spread across large areas (e.g., 3 buoys
per 100 km
2
).

Fig. 2: This shows the plume-like ground truth data. 2(a) shows a
real satellite image and MODIS image of central basin of Lake Erie
in March 2012. The real satellite image of chlorophyll translated
to the real rate of chlorophyll, and then Gaussian plume model is
added into given sparse real data shown in 2(b).
To successfully run the experiments, we need to use
dense data. Thus, we interpolate chlorophyll data for Lake
Erie using the daily MODIS [17] data set (June to August
2012) and we opted to supplement the base Þeld with a
contaminant plume. A Gaussian plume model using two axes
of diffusivity and velocity produces dynamics similar to what
one might see in the ocean or a lake [18]. Finally, we have a
interpolated dense data for 1000 steps over an 100 m
2
area
to serve as the ground truth in Fig. 2.
Two separate experimental scenarios were used, both of
which assess the estimated variance in scalar Þelds con-
structed from measurements taken by robots:
1. Path planning and updating the temporal evolution model:
The robot initially samples 20 randomly selected Þeld values
to construct the variogram, 
Y
(h). The robot follows Alg. 2
to minimize temporal uncertainty over time and then
updates the evolution model. We assume that the robotÕs
velocity is constant, approximately 5  7m=s. The greedy
planner, which is selecting the next goal position in order
to minimize the total uncertainty without considering the
temporal changes [5], is used to compare the quality of our
approach.
2. Distributed workload for multi-robot system:
Each robot has an even initial partition to collect measure-
ments and follows the above procedure. When the robots are
collecting data following Alg. 2, Alg. 3 constructs and ma-
nipulates the graph partitions and distributes the workloads
as observations are updated.
B. Results
Fig. 2 shows the models of Þeld dynamics involving differ-
ent time and space. Fig. 3(a) demonstrates four regions that
have different Þeld dynamics after the 69
th
step. Fig. 3(b)
represents 13 different Þeld dynamics after the 217
th
step.
The Þeld is separated resulting from Alg. 2. Some distri-
butions of (~ 
t
;~ !
t
) are similar to the uniform distribution
because when the region is separated, the Þeld dynamics
initially are computed from the uniform distribution if there
are no past observations. It takes time to converge even
if it already has several observations. Fig. 4 shows the
steps for updating Þeld dynamics over time. If the Þeld
has sufÞciently large difference between values describing
sub-regions and the current region, the current region is
split or merged. Based on the differing Þeld dynamics, the
queries are distributed in the whole region. Once a split
occurs, each regionÕs temporal evolution model represents
the region better than before. This helps the robots sample
more efÞciently in the hotspot region becauseKV

increases
in the hotspot quickly over time.

Fig. 3: A robot estimates and updates the temporal evolution
model with adaptive path planning. Each region has an original
Þeld dynamics model. Each histogram represents how much of a
hotspot is formed. The X-axis is 
p
and the Y-axis is !
p
.
Fig. 4: The initial temporal evolution weight set is an uniform
distribution, and then updated when the robot samples new data.
If E is enough to split or merge, each region has different !
distribution depends on the given data. X-axis is 
p
, and Y-axis
is !
p
. The red dots are the tentative queries. Each region has
a different number of queries generated by the importance of
temporal dynamics. Two cases shows a different degree of temporal
variability depends on the histrogram of the region.
To evaluate the quality of our results, we show the cross-
validation by Mean Square Error between ground truth and
our estimation over time. We tested these for Þve trials
shown in Fig. 5(b) which yields better cross-validation than
the greedy planner. As we follow the scenarios of multi-robot
case, our approach shows better cross-validations with low
variance and faster convergence time.
Fig. 5(a) demonstrates the distributed workloads for two
robots. In Fig. 5(c), after a short amount of time, the differ-
ence of workload gradually approaches zero, showing that
the workloads are well distributed. However, when a Þeld is
Þrst split or merged, the workloads may be unbalanced for
some time as the Þeld model needs to be updated and to
converge after the transition occurs. These transitions inßu-
ence each robotÕs workload in the Þeld as the robot samples
new data. If each workload increases or decreases drastically,
the overall workload can ßuctuate until it eventually settles
down with the split Þeld. After the 350
th
step, the workload
increases for a while with the Þeld redistribution by Alg. 3,
but when another transition happens at the 450
th
step, the
workload gradually decreases. In other words, This shows
non-monotonic after split transition and Þeld redistribution.
We believe that this settling time is related to the initial
histogram distribution and redistributed split Þeld.

Fig. 5: The workload is distributed to two robots while each robot
estimates and updates their Þeld dynamics. 5(a) shows that the graph
represents the workload including Þeld dynamics, the size of each
region, and the distance between nearby regions. 5(b) shows two
planners that are cross-validations with ground truth. One is based
on our approach with the ground truth over time. Another is the
traditional approach with the ground truth over time. Data are from
Þve separate trials of each case. 5(c) shows several sharp increases
when the transition of separation is happened in the region (e.g.,
75

, 140

, 200

, 350

, and 450
th
steps).
VI. CONCLUSION
This paper shows (1) how to model the temporal evo-
lution Þeld and (2) how to distribute the robotsÕ work-
loads. The main idea is to treat the temporal variability
as uncertainty in the interpolator. This approach can be
seen as major simpliÞcation of a traditional spatio-temporal
interpolation [9], which although widely known has seen
comparatively little use in robotic sampling. The approach
we outline facilitates modeling non-homogeneous temporal
evolution as well as balancing the workload of the multi-
robot system with efÞcient communication overhead, thus
each robot adaptively has a balanced workload depending
on the temporal variability of the assigned Þeld.
The experiments cross-validate the estimated Þeld with
ground-truth values from the simulated data. The results
show generally good performance even though the data have
temporal variability. Moreover, in multi-robot experiments,
the robots have a balanced workload, sharing only Þeld
dynamics and not the measurements themselves.
It is worth noting that the uncertainty estimates in this
work are used predominantly for determining when a lo-
cation should be sampled and then which robot should be
responsible for carrying out the measurement. The simple Ñ
perhaps even simplisticÑ model sufÞces to ensure that the
distributed system responds online to changes in the Þeld
by building an evolving model itself. A shortcoming of the
uncertainty model, however, is that for robotsi andj, where
e
ij
2E, the KV

i
and KV

j
may not be continuous at the
shared boundary. This means, for example, that the quad-tree
structure may introduce some artefacts along the division
line. The method of [6] can address this, but it remains
unclear how such an implementation might be distributed
in communication constrained settings.
