Abstract—In cell manipulation with optical tweezers, it is 
required that the cell must be located within the optical trap. 
Due to the lack of a control technique that can automatically 
locate the cell within the optical trap while controlling the cell 
motion, the cell will easily escape from the optical trap and hence 
the manipulation task is failed. Therefore, development of a 
unified controller that can control both cell trapping and cell 
motion simultaneously has received increased attention in 
optical cell manipulations. In this paper, we addressed this 
challenging problem by developing a novel visual based control 
method that controls both cell positioning and cell trapping 
simultaneously. We first established a new geometric model 
aiming for confining the cell within a local region near the 
optical trap, and then formulated a so-called Cell-Tweezers 
Coalition (C-T Coalition). We secondly developed a potential 
field function based controller to drive the C-T Coalition to the 
desired position while avoiding collisions with any other 
obstacles in environment. Finally, we performed experiments of 
transferring yeast cells to demonstrate the effectiveness of the 
proposed approach. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
Manipulation of live cells at the single cell level has 
inspired a lot of interests in both biology and medicine. 
Several experimental techniques have been developed for 
micromanipulation, such as micropipette aspiration [1-2], 
atomic force microscope [3], microfabricated cell pusher [4], 
microinjection [5] and magnetic tweezers [6-7]. Recently, 
micromanipulation technology with optical tweezers has 
attracted considerable attentions. Optical tweezers uses a 
tightly focused low-power laser beam to manipulate the 
microscopic particles, and exhibits advantages such as precise 
and non-contact manipulation manner, and producing little 
damage to the transferred biomedical objectives [8-10]. 
Optical tweezers can function as a special robot manipulator 
to trap and manipulate particles, in the order of piconewtons 
and nanometers in a noncontact manner [9, 11]. Optical 
trapping works only when the particles locate inside a certain 
area near the centroid of the focused laser beam [12].  
Most of cell manipulation systems equipped with optical 
tweezers are operated manually so far. In [13-15], an open 
loop control strategy was adopted to transfer cells along 
pre-designed collision-free paths. Similar methods was

reported in [16], where an A* motion planner was proposed to 
transfer a single cell. In [17], a simple feedback control 
scheme was proposed to transfer micro particles. A closed 
loop control strategy, reported in [18], automatically 
manipulated single as well as multiple cells in obstacle-free 
environment. In [19], a region based flocking control strategy 
was proposed to manipulate multiple cells in formations. All 
these works assumed that the cell was located near the 
trapping center of the laser beam in the control design. A 
recent effort aiming to control both cell trapping and cell 
manipulation in obstacle-free environment was reported in 
[20]. 
In cell manipulation with optical tweezers, the trapped cell 
may easily escape from the optical trap, which causes the 
manipulation task to fail. In the current paper, we developed a 
novel solution to overcome this problem. Motivated by our 
formal works on connectivity control in networked robots 
[21-22], we proposed a unified controller that controls cell 
trapping, cell positioning and collision avoidance 
simultaneously. To achieve this goal, we firstly proposed a 
new geometrical model that confines the cell within a local 
region around the center of the optical trap, and based on this 
model we established the geometrical constraint for the 
trapped cell. Secondly, we proposed a new concept, termed 
the Cell-Tweezers (C-T) Coalition, to define the connection 
between the cell and the optical trap. Then, we designed a 
potential field function based feedback controller to drive 
such a C-T Coalition to the desired position, while keeping 
collision free with the other particles in environment.  
Compared to the existing works, the proposed method 
employs a unified controller aiming for solving cell trapping, 
cell manipulation and obstacle avoidance simultaneously in 
optical manipulation of cells. The approaches proposed in [16, 
18, 19] solved the cell manipulation but failed to address the 
cell trapping problem. Compared to the approach in [20], our 
controller can solve the problem of obstacle avoidance, which 
makes the controller easily applied to practical applications. 
II. MANIPULATION SYSTEM 
Figure 1 illustrates a robot-assisted optical tweezers 
system for cell manipulation. The system includes a diode 
laser (808 nm, 2 W), a CCD camera, a microscope objective, a 
X-Y motorized stage (PIM-111.1DG) and a host computer. 
The cells are contained in a slide placed on the motorized 
stage. The laser beam produced by the laser passes through a 
beam expander, reflected by the dichroic mirror, and finally 
focused on the sample in the slide. The optical tweezers is 
fixed, and the relative movement between the cell and the 
sample holder can be accomplished by moving the stage. 
Position of the cell can be obtained through image processing

with the visual feedback from a CCD camera. All components 
of the system are supported upon an action isolated platform.  
The control strategy for cell manipulation is shown in Fig. 
2. In the initial phase, image processing technology is used to 
detect the environment information including the positions of 
cells and any other bio-tissues. Then, the target cell is labeled 
by the operator, and trapped by the optical tweezers 
automatically. The destination of the trapped cell is assigned 
through the software interface. Finally, the cell is transferred 
to the destination with the proposed control algorithm.

Similarly, denote the laser trap as a sphere too, centered at 
??

motion of the trapped cell consist of the trapping force

caused by the optical trap and the viscous drag force

caused by the liquid, as reported in [18, 23]. The dynamics of 
the trapped cell is then given by

where q b F

representing the trapping force as shown in Fig. 3, and 
a denotes the trapping stiffness. Note that q l? denotes the 
offset between the centroid of the target cell and the focus of 
the laser beam. As seen in Fig. 3, the trapping force increases 
approximately linearly as the offset increases when 
0
r q l ? ? , and the trapping force decreases approximately 
linearly as the offset increases when 
0
r q l ? ? . The trapping 
force becomes zero when the cell is completely outside the 
trap. Therefore, it is ideal to confine the trapped cell within a 
neighbored of the laser beam to prevent the cell escaping from 
the optical trap during manipulation [18-19]. This 
neighborhood can be represented as the trapping area 
formulated as follows

III. MODELING 
A.  Cell-tweezers (C-T) coalition 
Fig. 4 illustrates the cell in optical trap. The target cell is 
denoted with a sphere with solid line, and the optical trap is 
denoted as a sphere with dotted line. The optical tweezers can 
trap the cell only when the centroid of the cell locates inside 
the trapping area C, which is denoted as the solid circle in Fig. 
4 (a). In other words, the center of the laser beam should be 
controlled to stay “connected” with the trapped cell by 
maintaining the cell always located inside the trapping area C 
during the manipulation. Such a Cell-Tweezers (C-T) 
connection pair is defined as a Cell-Tweezers Coalition (C-T 
coalition) in this paper, sharing a similar coalition idea to the 
multirobot connectivity control in our previous works [21].

With integration of the C-T coalition constraint and the

In the mentioned space F, the target cell locates within the

coalition remains collision-free. 
Denote

which is also the control input. We then formulate the 
coalition manipulation problem as follows: 
Consider the cell manipulation system with dynamics (3).

input u to drive the target cell to a desired position g while 
maintaining ?? 0 , 0 t ? ? ? t G .

Theorem 1 Consider a cell manipulation system equipped 
with optical tweezers and subjected to dynamics (3). Under 
the initial configuration of ?? 0 0? G , the control law (8) gives 
rise to: i) ?? 0 , 0 t ? ? ? t G ; ii) The trapped cell is confined 
within the optical trap; iii) The C-T coalition is obstacle-free. 
Proof: Denote G

The following shows that the constraint condition (6) will 
always be maintained. If the constraint condition (6) is broken 
and the center of laser beam locates very close to the boundary 
of the free coalition manipulation space, either of the 
following two cases holds. 
Case 1: The target cell escapes from optical trap, and the 
center of the laser beam almost locates outside the boundary 
of free coalition manipulation space formed by 0 ?

V. SIMULATION 
A simulation was performed on manipulating the yeast cell 
to demonstrate the proposed control approach. The 
parameters of the yeast cell and optical tweezers were chosen 
as [23]: the critical offset was ?m . r 0 2
0
? , and the trap 
stiffness on yeast cell was calibrated as ?m pN a / 6 . 0 ? . Drag 
coefficient of blood was calibrated as
 
) /( 358 . 0 ?ms pN b? at 
25 degrees centigrade. 
As shown in Fig. 5 (a), the yeast cell was denoted by the 
big circle, and the laser beam was denoted as the small circle. 
The initial position of the target cell was q(0)=[ ?m 0 , ?m 0 ]
T
. 
The destination was denoted by crosses with configurations of 
g=[ ?m 25 , ?m 30 ]
T
. Six obstacles were positioned in the 
workspace, denoted by disks with configuration of 
q 1=[ ?m 5 , ?m 15 ]
T
, q 2=[ ?m 0 2 , ?m 30 ]
T
, q 3=[ ?m 15 , ?m 30 ]

, and q 6=[ ?m 0 , 
?m 25 ]
T
. The sampling period was chosen as 1ms in the 
simulation. The feedback control gain was set as 20 ? k . 
Fig. 5 illustrates the cell transformation process under the 
proposed controller (8), where the motion trajectory of the 
trapped cell is denoted by the solid curve. Figs. 5 (a)-(c) 
illustrate the manipulation evolution at different times. Fig. 5 
(d) shows that the cell manipulation task was achieved 
successfully.  
Fig. 6 illustrates the control performance under the 
controller (8). Fig. 6 (a) illustrates the position error of the 
trapped cell in both x and y axes. All the position errors 
converged to zero, implying the success of the coalition 
manipulation task. Fig. 6 (b) illustrates the offset q l? 
during the manipulation. The maximum value was below 
?m 2 , implying that the cell was trapped consistently during 
manipulation.  
VI. EXPERIMENT 
Since the optical tweezers was fixed in the equipment 
setup, the manipulation maneuver was accomplished by 
moving the stage in the experiment. As illustrated in Fig. 4, a 
transformation matrix that transforms the control input of the 
optical tweezers to the velocity control input of the moving 
stage was formulated as follows

the target cell decreased to zero, implying that the coalition

illustrates the variation of offset q l? during the 
manipulation. It is seen that the offset was well confined 
within the critical offset 
0

that the cell was trapped by the laser beam all the time. 
VII. CONCLUSION 
The current paper presented a novel unified controller for 
efficient manipulation of cells with robotically controlled 
optical tweezers. The proposed approach could transfer the 
target cell to the destination while locating cell within the 
optical trap consistently, and avoid collisions to the other 
particles during the manipulation. The proposed unified 
controller was based on employment of a novel geometric 
model, termed C-T coalition, aiming to confine the cell within 
the optical trap, with further consideration of obstacle 
avoidance. Compared to the existing control approaches for 
cell manipulation, the proposed unified controller could 
control the cell positioning, cell trapping and obstacles 
avoidance simultaneously. Simulation and experiment 
conducted on transferring the yeast cell demonstrated the 
effectiveness of the proposed control approach.
