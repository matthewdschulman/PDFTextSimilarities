AbstractÑRapidly deployable surgical robots pose minimal
interruption to surgical workßow and require minimal setup
time and equipment to support deployment. This paper explores
the concept of rapid deployment through the use of in-vivo
sensory information to adapt a pre-operative surgical plan and
to increase robustness against registration and misalignment
errors during robot deployment. Robotic insertion of cochlear
implant electrode arrays is presented as a benchmark application
demonstrating this concept. Two key ideas are presented within
the context of this application: First, a hybrid position and
admittance controller is used to deÞne an insertion path plan
that is modiÞed based on in-vivo force measurements in order
to reduce sensitivity to misalignment errors. Secondly, a new
concept allowing the use of force cues to determine the onset
of advance-off stylet electrode array insertion is presented. The
new controller is tested with electrode insertions in both plastic
models and human cadaveric specimens. The experiments show
that insertion forces may be maintained or reduced compared to
preplanned trajectories relying solely on the initial registration.
I. INTRODUCTION
Surgical robots augment surgeonÕs capabilities by providing
distal dexterity enhancement [1]Ð[3] and precision enhance-
ment [4], [5]. The added capabilities offered by surgical robots
are typically justiÞed when they act as technological enablers
(i.e. when they enable surgeons to carry tasks that would
have been otherwise impossible to perform) and when there
is a clear patient beneÞt and an economic justiÞcation to the
added cost. Clinically successful systems must overcome im-
pediments to technology adoption by minimizing their impact
in terms of size, cost, footprint in the surgical arena, and
interruption/delays to the existing non-robot-assisted surgical
workßow. In this paper, we focus on reducing surgical deploy-
ment time and cost by eliminating the need for costly imaging
technology and exact registration to the anatomy.
This paper focuses on automated electrode array insertion
for cochlear implant (CI) surgery. CI surgery introduces an im-
plant into the cochlea to restore acoustic perception in patients
with profound or total hearing loss through direct electrical
stimulation. This application demonstrates our proposed rapid
deployment approach, which leverages surgeon expertise and
in-vivo sensory information to adapt the electrode insertion.
Surgeon expertise assumes fundamental understanding of the
cochlear anatomy and in-vivo sensory information includes
position of the electrode array tip, estimates of the electrode
array shape, and measured insertion forces.
The topics most related to the subject matter of this paper
include works on robotic insertion of ßexible beams and works

on electrode array insertion for cochlear implant surgery.
Works on ßexible beam insertion typically assume knowledge
of the beam kinematics, known hole geometry, and beam shape
estimation with mechanics models or through vision systems
[6]Ð[8]. In this work, we are inspired by these approaches
but we do not make direct use of these results due to several
limitations: the electrode arrays are under-actuated composite
beams, the application domain does not allow 3D vision
systems to conÞrm the electrode shape, and the location and
shape of the target hole are not precisely known.
The Þrst work on robotic insertion of electrode arrays
appeared in [9], [10] where different kinematic arrangements
and degrees of freedom in manipulating electrode arrays dur-
ing the insertion process were considered. Subsequent works
including [11], [12] have presented clinically adapted versions
of electrode array insertion tools. There is also work focused
on robotic drilling of the mastoidectomy [13], [14] and drilling
access to the cochlea [15] for percutaneous insertion [11], [12],
[16]. So far in the works on insertion systems, many use force
sensing as a metric for insertion quality [9], [11], [17]Ð[22]
but, to the best of the authorsÕ knowledge, there has been no
exploration of using force based control methods to actively
adapt electrode insertion plans.
Our prior work [23] presented an insertion plan based
solely on kinematic modeling of the electrode arrays and
perfect knowledge of the cochlea shape. The results of this
insertion planner were in close agreement with manufacturer
speciÞcation for recommended manual insertion technique.
However, it is unlikely that a deployed robotic system will
have both perfect knowledge of the cochlea shape and perfect
registration to the anatomy since the entrance into the cochlea
is created intra-operatively. Methods of completing implant
insertion without reliance on extra sensors and imaging steps
also has the potential to save cost and time.
In this work, we investigate the potential application of
hybrid position/admittance control to the insertion of cochlear
implant electrodes. The clinical goal is to move toward rapidly
deployable robotic insertion tools that are not constrained to
Þxed registration techniques or require additional new compo-
nents outside the robot itself to perform the task. Validation
of this approach is presented through testing in plastic models
and cadaveric specimens.
II. SURGICAL ENVIRONMENT
A. Cochlear Anatomy
The cochlea is a structure in the inner ear where acoustic
energy is converted to electrical impulses for processing in
the brain as sound. It is a helical structure consistent of three
helical chambers; the scala tympani, the scala media, and the

scala vestibuli (Fig. 1(A)). The scala tympani is separated from
the scala media by a thin basilar membrane.
During CI surgery, electrode arrays are inserted into the
scala tympani since insertion in this chamber has been shown
to be advantageous [24]. The round window is a visible
anatomical landmark that seals the base of the scala tympani
with a thin membrane. The electrode array is inserted into
the scala tympani by using either the round window or by
surgically creating a new opening called a cochleostomy,
which is typically located inferior to the round window [25]. In
the following analysis, we use the term insertion point to refer
to either the cochleostomy or the round window - depending
on the technique practiced by the surgeon.
To perform robotic insertion of cochlear implants a set of
frames must be deÞned to describe the spatial relationship
between the robot, electrode, and the cochlea itself. Recently,
a panel of clinicians have proposed a standardized coordinate
frame model for the cochlea [26], which is adopted here to
deÞne the cochlea framefCg. Figure 1(B) depicts framefCg
with respect to cochlea features. The axis of the cochleaÕs
helix deÞnes

B. Electrode arrays
CI electrode arrays fall into two major categories based on
their desired location inside the cochlea. Lateral wall electrode
arrays (LEA) are thin, straight electrodes designed to slide
along the lateral (outer) wall of the cochlea. Perimodiolar
electrode arrays (PEAÕs) are under-actuated, ßexible structures
designed to remain in close proximity of the modiolar (inner)
wall of the cochlea. In both electrode designs there is a desire
to produce atraumatic insertions through a combination of
compliant mechanical design and soft surgical technique [27].
Also, when using either electrode design the goal for Þnal
placement is to remain in the scala tympani and not puncture
the basilar membrane to avoid trauma to ganglion cells which
support residual hearing. PEAÕs use a stylet to straighten a

Contour Advance shown) are single DoF ßexible structures designed to
maintain contact with the modiolus of the cochlea. They are actuated through
the removal of an embedded stylet. (B) Lateral wall electrodes are non-
actuated and designed to maintain contact with the outer wall of the cochlea.
coiled elastomeric electrode array. The stylet is initially fully
inserted in the electrode array and is removed from the PEA
as it is inserted into the cochlea using a technique called AOS
(advance off stylet). This technque allows the PEA to conform
to the shape of the inner wall during insertion [27]. For this
study, PEA were used due to the extra DoF provided by the
under-actuated electrode design.
C. Surgical Work-ßow and Relevance
We brießy review the standard ßow of CI surgery to provide
context to where robotic insertion Þts into the framework
and its potential beneÞts. Imaging is routinely used in the
preoperative planning stage to alert the surgeon to anatomical
structures they wish to avoid damaging during drilling. At the
start of the procedure the surgeon gains access to the inner ear
through a mastoidectomy and excavation of bone leading to
the facial recess. After opening the facial recess the surgeon
has a direct view of the cochlea and can identify the round
window. The surgeon selects the point of entry into the cochlea
and creates an opening approximately 1mm in diameter. The
implantÕs transceiver is Þxed to the patientÕs skull and then the
implant is gently inserted into the cochlea. After testing the
implantÕs basic electric function the surgical site is closed.
When using a robot for electrode insertion we assume
that the patientÕs skull can be held Þxed to the operative
table using head straps and MayÞeld frames that lock on
the patientÕs teeth. We assume that the surgeon knows the
location of the electrode insertion point and can use the
robot to digitize the location of this point. We also assume
that the intra-cochlear anatomy is devoid of abnormalities as
can be veriÞed by routine pre-operative imaging required by
the current surgical workßow. If 3D exact reconstruction and
segmentation methods are used as described in [28] then a
more exact model of the intracochlear anatomy may be used.
In the absence of an exact intracochlear model we assume that
the general intracochlear anatomy follows the a shape function
proposed by Cohen et al. [29]. Since our approach relies on
using force insertion data to modify the insertion path, we do
not depend on exact knowledge of the intra-cochlear anatomy.
The proposed robotic insertion algorithm and workßow
incorporates both a preplanning phase and a hybrid admit-
tance controller to compensate for registration errors during
insertion. The steps for insertion are deÞned as follows:
1) The surgeon directs the tip of the robot gripper to
the insertion point and deÞnes the suggested angle of

placement taken in the plastic phantom model. (C) a Þberscope inserted
through the excavated ear canal was used to observe electrode insertion (solid
circle) into the human cochlea (dashed circle)
approach. This deÞnes the Þnal point of the preplanned
insertion.
2) After retracting the robot tip from the insertion point, the
PEA is loaded into the gripper and the force sensor goes
through an unbiasing routine.
3) The surgeon directs the robot to bring the tip of the
electrode to the insertion point.
4) An estimate of the initial shape of the PEA is made and
the insertion planning algorithm from [23] generates a
nominal insertion path.
5) The hybrid position-admittance control laws are enabled
and the insertion is executed.
Sections III and IV present the details of the insertion
planning and proposed insertion strategy.

gripper position and orientation are parameterized byx and
respectively.
The shape of the electrode array (in the absence of outside
forces) is constrained to a plane in framefCg and whose local

Calibration of individual PEAÕs prior to insertion is not
clinically viable since reinsertion of the stylet into an array
is not allowed prior to insertion in a patient. However, prior
measured data may be used to construct a likely PEA matrix
A.
Figure. 4 is used to describe the insertion constraint. When
the PEA tip is brought to the insertion point it must pass

the hybrid position-admittance controller.
IV. HYBRID POSITION-ADMITTANCE CONTROLLER
The goal of the hybrid position-admittance controller is
to correct for both registration and shape estimation errors
during insertion. This type of controller is similar to hybrid
force controllers that have been applied to many problems
and the foundational work can be reviewed in [30], [31].
Figure 5 shows a simpliÞed block diagram of the implemented
controller. The original point commanded from the insertion
trajectory x
p
(d) is called x
des
to which the force controller
adds a corrective value x
admit
to send as the commanded
position to the low level controller (LLC) as x
ref
. The LLC
contains the standard task space controller calculating inverse
kinematics and using a PID controller for joint level control.

of N, which deÞnes the lateral plane, apply corrective displacement on
the command position x

stylet actuation _ qs . The function h(fv; freg ) refers to (17). The low level
controller (LLC) controls the end effector position. Orientation  is not
affected by the admittance law and is omitted in areas for clarity
The force/moment sensor frame is denoted asfFg and the
force applied to the sensor is f
T
s
. Force measurements are
used to modify control in the lateral plane of insertion and
separately for the actuation of the stylet.
A. Hybrid Controller in Lateral Plane
Given ^ v as the insertion direction in the robot base frame
we wish to actively adjust the end effector position in the
plane normal to ^ v based on perceived forces in that plane. A
projection matrix N is deÞned as:
N =I  ^ v

^ v
T

(10)
which governs the space in which our force control can act.
Forces acting in the space of N are called lateral forces. The
perceived force (
F

) requires a forward feeding compensation
term

( ) to account for the force due to gravity acting on
the insertion module:

where f

is the rotation matrix describing framefBg in frame
fFg. Each time the system is initialized a training routine
is performed to determine the direction of gravity and the
sensorÕs static bias. This training requires collecting a set of
poses varying in orientation and applying a least squares Þtting
to f
g
and b
f
in (11).
After applying a 25ms moving average Þlter at 1kHz
sampling rate and unbiasing, the resulting force projection into

This saturation limit acts as a safety against potential malfunc-
tioning in the force transducer.
B. Underactuated Electrode Controller
Insertion direction forces are primarily governed by proper
execution of AOS technique. The actuation of the stylet
is unidirectional ( _ q
s
 0). In an ideal PEA insertion, the
electrode is inserted until the basal turn, at which point the
surgeon holds the stylet Þxed in space and continues to guide
the rest of the electrode into the cochlea. If done correctly,
the PEA maintains minimal sliding contact with the modiolar
wall and does not touch the lateral wall (Fig 2(A)). Forces
along the insertion direction ^ v are called insertion forces (f
v
)
deÞned as:
f
v
= ^ v
T
~
f
s
(15)
If the AOS techique is executed too late, the PEA will make
contact with the lateral wall and the reaction force may be
detected along the insertion vector. Actuation of the stylet
moves the PEA toward the modiolar wall and in general
establishes a relationship of the form:
_ q
s
=g(d)
_
f
v
; 8 _ q
s
 0 (16)
The exact form of g(d) depends on the internal geometry
of the cochlea, the elastic properties of a speciÞc PEA, and
the lubrication in the cochlea. A simple approach for online
applications is to take a look at the general mechanics of the
insertion and attempt to use _ q
s
to regulate insertion force
~
f
v
.
No signiÞcant force can be imparted on the cochlea in the
insertion direction ^ v by the PEA until the electrode has passed
the Þrst turn. In some experiments [11], [17] it can be seen
from the data that the PEA can reverse the direction of force
and effectively pull itself into the cochlea. We propose using
a control law on stylet actuation of the form:

The control law results in no correcting action to the pre-
planned stylet actuation for forces greater than f

a proportional adjustment for large resistive insertion forces.

the shape of the PEA.
V. EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION
The proposed insertion control law was validated through
a series of insertions in both plastic phantom models and in
human cadaveric temporal bone specimens. Insertions in plas-
tic models provided a means of observing electrode behavior
during insertion while temporal bone experiments determined
whether beneÞts in force reduction translate to real patient
anatomy.
Table I summarizes the experimental parameters. Data from
prior insertions [21] act as a baseline for comparison as they
did not use force control and relied solely on pre-registration.
The data sets Ó0Ó and Ó0bÓ reference plastic and bone in-
sertions respectively. The value of N indicates the number
of separate insertions in the data set. Only lateral admittance
control was applied to sets 1 and 2 at different proportional
gains. Force based adjustment of the AOS technique was then
added in sets 3 and 4 with insertion in temporal bone occurring
in set 5.
A 6 DoF Stewart-Gough parallel robot, previously presented
in [32] was used to control the end effector holding the
PEA called the insertion module (Fig. 3) shown in [21]. An
ATI Industrial Nano 43 transducer with a force resolution
of 0:004N and sampling rate of 1kHz was used to measure
forces. The entire system was controlled using the MATLAB
xPC real time control software on a 500MHz target machine
(Advantech pcn104 single board computer).

imens were identical. The cochlea was lubricated with a 50%
water / glycol solution as demonstrated in [17], [33] for the
plastic model and no additional lubricant was applied to the
temporal bone specimen as a fresh cochlea was used. The
steps presented in Section II-C were followed for insertion. A
Phantom Omni haptic control system was used to teleoperate
both the gripper tip and PEA distal tip to the insertion point.
The ear canal was opened to provide Þberscope access to
view the entire insertion into the cochlea. After completing
the insertion, the electrode was extracted and data collected
by the real time control system was exported for processing.
The multimedia extension shows an insertion experiment with
force data and an example of the modeled PEA kinematics.
VI. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Table II provides a summary of the insertion force results
across all sets. Force values are presented as averages with
the standard deviation in parentheses. Figures 6 and 7 plot
the average force in the insertion direction for the plastic and
bone insertion cases respectively. The percentage of insertion
completed based on distance travelled through the insertion
is parameterized by  and uses data from the Þrst 95% of
the insertion process. This is due to registration error causing
gripper collision with the insertion point. These contact forces
are signiÞcantly higher than the intra-cochlear forces from
insertion and do not represent legitimate intra-cochlear forces.
While collisions at the end of insertion were small in number,
a range of 95% was applied to all insertions to provide a fair
comparison.
Insertion forces were broken into two subsets; across the en-
tire insertion and during the AOS portion of insertion. Admit-
tance control applied in the lateral plane is active through the
entire insertion while the stylet actuation admittance control
can only affect the AOS portion of insertion. Set 0 and 0b act
as the baseline for comparison for plastic and bone insertions
respectively. A single sided t-test was used to compare the
new insertion controllerÕs performance with previous data.
Set 2 showed a statistically signiÞcant increase in average
force compared to Set 0 (p = 0:032 for full insertion and
p = 0:008 post-AOS). However in sets 3 and 4, which show
Fig. 6. Average Insertion Force Data for Plastic Model Insertions
Fig. 7. Average Bone Insertion Forces
enabled stylet admittance control data, there was no difference
with the baseline set and peak forces were also reduced. The
bone insertion data shows a statistical difference in post-AOS
insertion force in the temporal bone insertions when using the
admittance control law compared to non-force guided AOS
from our prior study [21]. There was no signiÞcant different
in lateral force between the sets. Little change in average pre-
AOS insertion forces could be seen.
Figure 8 shows Þnal corrections to insertion point location
in the lateral plane at the end of insertion. In some cases,
the initial registration error was higher than one diameter of
the PEA. The force controller sufÞciently corrected the error
without large changes in insertion force. The entrance into
the cochlea requires passing through the facial recess and
motion corrections much greater than2mm are not generally
possible due to anatomical restrictions.

VII. CONCLUSIONS
In this work a hybrid force-position controller was applied
to the insertion of perimodiolar cochlear implants in both
plastic models and cadaveric specimens. The controller was
capable of maintaining insertion forces equivalent to those
previously observed using rigid registration Þxtures. In some
cases the initial registration of the insertion point was greater
than one PEA diameter and lateral forces could be maintained
below 30mN. Forces in temporal bone insertions saw a statis-
tically signiÞcant reduction in insertion force when applying
the hybrid force control. The process described in this work
still requires a visually guided estimate of the insertion point
location and further effort will be placed on removing this step
through integrated vision and elastic modelling of the electrode
array.
