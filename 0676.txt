Three Dimensional Trajectory Planner for Real Time Leader Following
Pedro Pereira, David Cabecinhas, Rita Cunha, Carlos Silvestre and Paulo Oliveira
AbstractÑThis paper presents an on-line three dimensional
trajectory planner for an unmanned vehicle following a Leader
vehicle, where the Follower remains at a speciÞed relative
position with respect to the Leader. The planner deÞnes the
trajectory for a virtual vehicle that will be used as reference
for the real Follower vehicle. The virtual Follower behaves like
a three dimensional trailer attached to the Leader and its
reference frame is used to specify the relative position vector.
At the kinematic level, the proposed planner requires only the
knowledge of the LeaderÕs linear speed, but not its angular
speed,andtheFollowerÕstrajectory canbegeneratedon-line,in
thesensethatno a prioriknowledgeoftheLeaderÕstrajectory is
required.Experimentalresultsobtainedwithquadrotorvehicles
are presented, which demonstrate the richness of the planned
trajectories.
I. INTRODUCTION
Multi-robot systems are an active research topic as they
allow improved performance on accomplishing automated
tasks. Multi-robot systems outperform single robot systems
in situations where a wide area needs to be covered like
terrainmappingor explorationofaseaßoor[1],[2].Another
use case is load transportation where a formation of vehicles
can handle loads that would be otherwise impossible for a
single vehicle to transport [3]. Multiple vehicle formations
are also employed in critical missions, where the objective
is of paramount importance and robustness to vehicle loss is
required [4].
In the Leader-Follower approach to formation control, the
objective is for a Follower vehicle to remain at a Þxed
relativeposition, in a given referenceframe,w.r.t. the Leader
vehicle. The problem is completely characterized by the
relative position vector and the reference frame where it is
deÞned. The choice of reference frame plays an important
role in the deÞnition of the FollowerÕs trajectory and in the
sensory informationnecessary for computingsuch trajectory.
AstraightforwardapproachtotheLeader-Followerformation
deÞnition is to specify the relative position vector in the
inertial reference frame as in [5], [6]. This method results
in a simple trajectory for the Follower, in the sense that
both the Leader and the Follower describe an identical path,

apart from a translation. This is inconvenient for mapping
or terrain covering purposes because the FollowerÕs path can
overlap with the LeaderÕs path, reducing the efÞciency gains
of using multiple aircraft.
DeÞning the relative position vector in a reference frame
rotating with the Leader, such as the LeaderÕs Serret-Frenet
frame, results in Follower trajectories with more complex
behavior. This approach has been proposed by several au-
thors [7], [8], [9] but requires, at the kinematic level, the
explicit knowledge of parameters that are not easily mea-
sured or estimated by the Follower, such as the LeaderÕs
reference frame angular velocity. Additionally, the works
deal with a two dimensional setting and an extension for
a three dimensional environment is not trivial, as it can
lead to discontinuities or trajectories that are ill-deÞned as a
consequence of choosing a Serret-Frenet reference frame.
A two part solution to the Leader-Follower formation
problem in here proposed. First, a desired trajectory is
computed for an ideal Follower vehicle, hereafter called
virtual Follower. This reference trajectory is then used as
a reference to a trajectory tracking controller that drives the
real Follower vehicle to the desired trajectory. In this paper,
we focus on the Þrst problem of generating the follower
trajectory and present experimental results for the complete
planning/tracking problem using quadrotor vehicles. A new
trajectory generation strategy is proposed to address the
Leader-Follower problem where the relative position vector
is speciÞed in a reference frame attached to the virtual
Follower, which is always well-deÞned. By imposing the
appropriatekinematic constraints on the reference frame, the
virtual Follower is made to behave as a three dimensional
trailer attached to the Leader.Thetrajectoryplannerdoesnot
require,atthe kinematiclevel,theknowledgeof theLeaderÕs
path curvature and torsion but it still produces trajectories
with a rich behavior that are not a simple translation of the
LeaderÕs path.
Quadrotors are aerial vehicles ideal for testing algorithms,
due to their simplicity, high maneuverability, VTOL/hover
capability and ability to track any trajectory within the
limits of their actuation dynamics. Tracking controllers for
quadrotor vehicles have been extensively studied in the
literature,c.f.thesurveyarticle[10],andthe virtualFollower
trajectory generated by our planner can be used as reference
for any generic tracking controller applied to the Follower
vehicle.

III. PROBLEM STATEMENT
In a Leader-Follower problem, the primary objective is to
keep the Leader and Follower vehicles separated by a Þxed
distance and a Þxed direction speciÞed in a given reference
frame.We proposeatwostep approachto theproblemwhich
separates the problem of trajectory planning from that of
trajectory tracking.
This paper focuses on the Þrst step of generating the
referencetrajectory.Theproblemisaddressedbyconsidering
a virtualvehiclethatmeetsthe primary objectiveatalltimes.
The plannerÕs output is then fed as a reference trajectory
to the trajectory tracking controller implemented in the real
Follower vehicle.
To describe the problem setup consider the inertial refer-
ence frame {I}, the LeaderÕs Frenet reference frame {L}
deÞned by the pair (
I

F
has a
signiÞcant impact on the planned trajectory. For example, if
we trivially set ?
F
= 0 then the virtual Follower path would
simply be a translation of the LeaderÕs path. If we impose
appropriate constraints on the angular velocity of the virtual
Follower we can generate richer trajectories, e.g. by forcing
the Follower vehicle to behave as a 3D trailer attached to the
Leader.We nowderivetheconditionson theangularvelocity

In a three dimensional setting, a trailer is a vehicle that can
only move longitudinally, i.e. u =ue

, and it is allowed to
yaw and pitch freely. Due to the nature of the longitudinal
link, the roll rate p
F
does not play any role in deÞning the
position of the Follower and can be interpreted as a degree
of freedom. Applying these restrictions to (2) it follows

For p

completely deÞned by (4), which only requires the knowl-

For a longitudinal link connecting the two vehicles, the

that case, the formation stays Þxed w.r.t.{I}. Hereafter, this

We are now able to state the following Theorem, aggre-
gating the results for the proposed Follower path generation
and convergence of the Leader-Follower system to a rigid
formation.

Proof: Consider the Lyapunov function V(z) =

FromLemma1,andfortheconditionsstatedintheTheorem,
it follows trivially that the time derivative (13) is negative

of r

to the solution (7)-(8) with positive r

From (13) it is clear that the solution in (7) satisfying

tation of this result, notice that the solution r

corresponds to a trailer being pulled (which is a stable
operation) and the solution r

B. Trajectory Planner for a Generic Rigid Link
We now consider a Leader-Follower formation with a
generic relative position vector d ? R
3
where d
y
and d
z
are no longer constrained to be zero. In order for the path
generation method to be an extension of the one described
in Section IV-A we maintain the virtual Follower kinematics
as deÞned in (4). Like with the longitudinal link situation,
the choice of roll rate plays no role in the convergence of
r
1
and the reasoning in Theorem 2 is applicable, which
guarantees convergence of r
1
to r
?
1
remains valid. Unlike
the previous situation, however, the roll rate does inßuence
the generated path since we now have the components d
y
and d
z
that interact with r
2
and r
3
to generate the virtual
6563
FollowerÕs position.
For the purposes of studying the generated Follower path
when the Leader is performing a trimming trajectory, the
convergence of r
2
and r
3
is analyzed through the introduc-
tion of a new error

relating the angular velocities of the Leader and Follower
along the direction r

. Keeping in mind that the Leader-
Follower formation is deÞned by the relative position vector
L
p
L|F
=Rd, a rigid formation is attained when the rotation
matrix is constant. Given the rotation matrix kinematics (5)
and convergence of the error (6) to zero, a rigid formation
with a generic relative position vector is attained if and only
if the error z

is zero.

Similarly to what occurs for the error z, there are two
solutions that satisfy z
2
= 0. To have a better understanding
of what the solutions correspond to, consider a Leader
describing a circular path and d = [d
x
d
y
0] with d
x
> 0
and d
y
> 0, as shown in Figure 2. In the Þgure, two Leaders
are shown describing a path in clockwise and anti-clockwise
directions. The notion of clockwise and anti-clockwise is
arbitrary and it is deÞned in this work as follows: consider
the unit vector n, then if the LeaderÕs angular velocity
is aligned with n, i.e. n
T I
L
R?
L
> 0, the rotation is
clockwise; if those are misaligned, i.e. n
T I
L
R?
L
< 0, the
rotation is anti-clockwise (an ambiguous situation exists if
n
T I
L
R?
L
= 0). For each of these situations, the Follower
can meet the rigid formation speciÞcation d in two different
ways, correspondingto the two solutionsR

We propose a trajectory planner that imbues the Follower
vehicle with the following behavior. If the LeaderÕs rota-
tion is clockwise the Follower moves in an outer circle,
corresponding to R
?
1
in (15). On the other hand, if the
LeaderÕs rotation is anti-clockwise the Follower moves in an
inner circle, corresponding to the solution R
?
2
in (15). This
behavior is proposed because the LeaderÕs third axes

Re

inverts direction from clockwise to anti-clockwise paths but
it is desirable that the virtual FollowerÕs third axes
I
F
Re
3
remains aligned with n, mimicking the behavior of a 2D
trailer with d
y

a planar path, the Follower is also required to describe a
planar path in a plane parallel to that of the Leader, leading
to (

The value of? is deÞned to ensure that the stable solution to

instead of the discontinuous function ? so as to provide a
smooth enough reference position to the trajectory tracking
controller. With the roll rate deÞned as in (16), the error z

C. Trajectory Planner Summary
The proposed trajectory planner is a dynamic one, in the
sense that it computesthe virtual FollowerÕs trajectory based
on (1). The virtual Follower rotation matrix
I
F
R can be
interpreted as the state of the planner and whose kinematics
are ruled by (4) and (16).
For the initialization, two options are available. If the
Leader is initially at rest then the desired Follower position
should be that which is closest to the real Follower. If the
Leader is initially moving then the best guess is that it
is moving straight, in which case the virtual Follower is
initializedtomatchtheequilibriumsolution,i.e.

V. EXPERIMENTAL SET-UP
The proposed trajectory planner was tested with two
radio controlled Blade mQX quadrotor vehicles [13]. A
VICON Bonita motion capture system [14], composed of
12 cameras and markers attached to the quadrotors,provides
highly accurate position and orientation measurements for
the Leader and Follower at a rate of 100Hz. The trajectory
planner is implemented in a Matlab/Simulink model, which
computestheFollowerÕspositionreferenceandfeedsitto the
quadrotorsÕ trajectory tracker controller developed in [15]
which requires a time-parametrized position reference of
class C
3
. Consequently, the trajectory planner requires the
knowledge of p

rotations, respectively. Because

is aligned with n, the
FollowerÕs curvature is smaller when the LeaderÕs rotation
is clockwise and larger when the LeaderÕs rotation is anti-
clockwise.
Finally, in Figure 4(a), d = [0.4 0.4 0]
T
(m) and a Leader
quadrotor describes a circular path with a sinusoidal altitude
variation. The LeaderÕs path is not planar but the virtual
Follower, which behaves like a 3D trailer attached to the
Leader, is at each moment compelled to remain in the oscu-
latingplaneoftheLeader(spannedby
I

and

).As
shown in Figure 4(b), the tracking error converges to zero,
which is equivalent to the convergence of the magenta and
blues lines.
VII. CONCLUSION
In this paper, a real-time three dimensional trajectory
planner for Leader following is presented. The proposed
solution maintains a Þxed relative position vector between
Leader and Follower, written in a virtual Follower reference
frame, and it does not require a priori knowledge of the
LeaderÕs path. For a longitudinal relative position vector,
the virtual Follower reference frame is that of a three
dimensional trailer attached to the Leader. Convergence of
the formation for a Leader describing a trimming trajectory
was shown, considering both a longitudinal and a generic
relative positive vector. Experimentsperformed with quadro-
tor vehicles were conducted that demonstrate the richness
and suitability of the generated trajectories. Directions for
future work include studying a sequence of n-trailers and
incorporating a collision avoidance strategy.
