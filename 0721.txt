AbstractÑWeproposeaframeworkforcombiningvisionand
haptic information in human-robot joint actions. It consists of a
hybrid controller that uses both visual servoing and impedance
controllers. This can be applied to tasks that cannot be done
with vision or haptic information alone. In this framework, the
state of the task can be obtained from visual information while
haptic information is crucial for safe physical interaction with
the human partner. The approach is validated on the task of
jointly carrying a ßat surface (e.g. a table) and then preventing
an object (e.g. a ball) on top from falling off. The results show
that this task can be successfully achieved. Furthermore, the
framework presented allows for a more collaborative setup, by
imparting task knowledge to the robot as opposed to a passive
follower.

I. INTRODUCTION
Humanoid robots provide many advantages when working
together with humans to perform various tasks. This is
because humans have an extensive experience in physically
collaborating with each other. Hence, humanoids can interact
with humans because of their human-like range of motion
and sensing capabilities. This reduces the need to learn how
to interact with the robot. However, many challenges are
still present in the various research areas that study physical
human-robot collaboration. Here, the area of interest is using
vision and force information together to enable human-robot
joint actions, which are collaborative tasks requiring both
parties to physically interact with each other (e.g. carrying a
large object together). In such tasks, the robot:
1) must move safely and regulate interaction forces,
2) shares control with a human-in-the-loop,
3) can only use its on-board sensors.
TheÞrsttwoitemsarethemainaspectofallphysicalhuman-
robot collaborative tasks. The last constraint is important for
true autonomy. For example if vision has a limited Þeld-of-
view, external room cameras should not be used.
Physical human-robot collaboration has largely relied on
the use of haptic data (force/torque) for control. This is
because the main priority is the regulation of the interaction
forces between the human and robot. For example, previous
works [1]Ð[4] have demonstrated that using only haptic

information, a humanoid robot can help a human carry
large objects (e.g. a table, a beam or a panel). A possible
future application of this is in construction sites [1]. The
same scenario can also be applied to the household, such
as moving furniture (e.g. table). While doing this task, one
can imagine the need to prevent an object on top from
falling off. For example in moving a table a short distance, it
might be necessary to move it carefully with the objects on
top rather than removing the objects, transporting the table
and then placing the objects back on top. In this scenario,
haptic information alone is not rich enough to give the
robot knowledge about the state of the objects on top of
the table. But vision can provide such information, being
largely complementary to haptics (analogous to human sight
and touch). Using both information sources may enable a
humanoid to perform more complicated tasks, similar to a
human. Although the beneÞts are great, there are not many
established methods integrating vision and force control.
In [5], three general categories for combining vision and

control is the simplest, and switches between a pure visual
servoing controller and a pure force control method given
a certain threshold of the task error. In hybrid methods,
a prior speciÞcation of a Òtask-frameÓ [6], [7] is required
to decouple vision and force into orthogonal spaces. With
this, the controllers can be designed separately. Finally,
shared control methods aim at utilizing both vision and force
informationtogetherinthesamespace,suchthatallavailable
information is used [5]. For example, in [8], a force feedback
is used to correct the visual servo control trajectory.
In this paper, the impedance control framework [9], is
used. This allows a manipulator to be compliant by deÞning
a virtual impedance. In this framework, vision can be used to
provide a reference trajectory that is tracked in the absence
of external forces [10]Ð[12]. When contact does occur, it
has the properties of shared control methods where vision
and force determine the control of the same degree of
freedom (DOF) simultaneously. This approach is preferred
over the others since it can allow for compliance in all DOF.
Previous works using this methodology [10], [11] presented
experiments of a robot interacting with objects. Here and in
our previous work [12], we use this approach for physical
human-humanoid collaboration experiments. Having a hu-
man as a physical collaborator means that some issues of this

context of physical collaboration.
Our work is partly based on the joint object transportation
framework which was introduced in [3] and utilized in [12].
The overall system is hybrid - using the 3 DOF that are
controlled with only haptic information in [3] and design-
ing shared controllers for the remaining DOF. These new
controllers use both vision and force to affect the DOF at
the same time. This complicates the semantics to describe
the whole system. In [12], vision was used together with
haptic data to stabilize the height of the table, providing the
reference trajectory of the impedance controller in 1DOF.
As a continuation to this work, we use the same general
framework of building a visual servoing controller for pro-
viding a reference trajectory to the impedance controller.
However, we relax the constraint on having a static object
in [12]: the object on the beam is free to move so control
in 2 DOF is needed. This is a more difÞcult task and vision
is indispensable for acquiring the state of the task. Another
contribution of this work is the analysis of collaboration in
joint actions when each agent has his/her own notion of
how to do the joint task, as opposed to the common leader-
follower strategy.
To continue, the general framework is described in Sec-
tion II. The example task of human-humanoid table carrying
while keeping an object on top from falling is then described
in Section III. The details on implementing the general
framework to this speciÞc task are given in Section IV.
Results from experiments are then presented in Section V.
Thenoveltyofequalcollaborationandthechallengesitposes
are discussed in Section VI. Finally, Section VII concludes
and outlines some future works to be done.
II. GENERAL CONTROL FRAMEWORK
Our general approach to combining vision and haptic cues
is coupling a visual servoing controller to an impedance
controller.ThissimpliÞesthedesignbydecouplingthevision
and force controllers in a systematic way. An overview of
the complete control framework is shown in Fig. 1.
Fig. 1. The general control framework applied to the task of balancing an
object on the table
Fig. 1 also shows the task example used in this paper -
balancing an object on the table. The following subsections
explain this general framework in a bottom-up approach
starting from the lower level controllers and abstracting it
higher to the cognitive level. The lowest level of control
is the inner joint-level control. This is represented by q
in Fig. 1. To abstract from the joint level to the Òtask
levelÓ, the Stack-of-Tasks framework is used [13]. It is a
generalized inverse kinematics abstraction layer that creates
a hierarchical organization of different tasks to be executed
givinghigherprioritytocriticaltasks[13].Itallowsforeasier
integration with sub-tasks. For example, our experiments
make use of the walking algorithm in [14] as a sub-task.
A. Impedance Control
The other sub-task concerns the grippers. In Fig. 1 the
humanoid uses its grippers to co-manipulate an object with
a human. To do this, it needs to be safe and intuitive to
use. Here, impedance control [9] is used to regulate the
contact interaction (for safety) between the robot and its
environment. It is based on a simple physical analogy to
the control - a virtual mass-spring-damper system [9]. This
system is governed by the general equation:
f =M(¬ x
d
?¬ x)+B(ú x
d
? ú x)+K(x
d
?x). (1)
The contact interaction is measured by the force-torque
sensors in the robot grippers and is represented as f. The
vectors x
d
,ú x
d
and ¬ x
d
are a desired pose and its Þrst
and second derivative. Correspondingly, vectors x,ú x and ¬ x
represent an actual pose and its Þrst and second derivative.
Finally, matrices M,B and K are the inertia, damping and
stiffness parameters that deÞne the desired virtual mass-
spring-damper system [9]. Strictly following the terminology
and causality from [9], our implementation on the HRP-
2 humanoid, is an Òadmittance controllerÓ since the robot
is position-controlled by the Stack-of-Tasks, which uses the
output of x,ú x and ¬ x from the impedance controller. These
are obtained by solving the differential equation of Eq. (1)
given the other variables. The parameters M, B, and K are
determined empirically to provide comfort for the human
collaborator. Finally,x
d
,ú x
d
and¬ x
d
are the desired pose and
trajectory of the mass-spring-damperÕs reference position.
These are detailed in the next subsection.

This case is illustrated in Fig. 2(a) where only the human

) such that the human
effort is minimized [3], [12], [15]. These works differ in the
approach taken to produce the desired pose and trajectory.

to give the desired pose. In [3], a human pair doing a joint
transportation task was studied and it was observed from the
data that the pair moves in constant velocity phases during
this task. A Þnite state machine (FSM) is then designed by
using the constant velocity assumption, giving the desired
pose and trajectory. Haptic cues are used to determine the
switchingofstatesintheFSM[3].Ourlatestwork[12]takes
the same approach as the one in this paper and is illustrated
by Fig. 2(b). Here, the humanoid is given knowledge of the
task. This is done by designing a visual servoing controller
speciÞc to the task and using the output as the desired
trajectory (x
d
,ú x
d
,¬ x
d
) of the impedance controller. This also
means that the robot has some autonomy in doing the task
driven by its own knowledge of the state of the task. With
the reasonable assumption that during the collaborative task
human motion is task-driven, the source (human intention
to do the task) is taken into account rather than the result
(human motion). This differentiates our approach from those
that aim to model/predict human motion such as [15].

robot as a pure follower guided only by haptic information. (b) illustrates an
equal collaboration approach where both human and robot have a complete
knowledge of the task (represented by the blue arrows). Furthermore, each
uses both vision (green) and haptic (red) information to achieve this task.
Visual servoing consists in controlling robots using visual
information [16]. To create the visual servoing portion of
the framework, two important components are needed: visual
feature tracking and a controller based on this feature [16].
However, in the current state-of-the-art for both modules
there is no ÒbestÓ approach that Þts all tasks and problems.
Existing methods have important tradeoffs to consider for
the whole system [16]. In our works, we take an analytical
approach to building the visual servoing portion.
III. TASK DESCRIPTION
As a test for the general framework described, the task of
jointly transporting a surface while keeping a mobile object
on top from falling off is used. Fig. 3 illustrates the task with
the reference frames and naming convention used in the rest
of this paper. The vectors composing the Cartesian frames
are color coded: Red-Green-Blue correspond to (~ x,~ y,~ z)
respectively.
Fig.3showsthattherobotcancontrolthetablethroughits

a reference Òcontrol frameÓ{cf}, rigidly linked to the table,

to a desired pose with respect to a local frame {l}, rigidly
linked to the robot torso. This pose is represented by the
homogeneous transformation matrix

the hand poses {rh} and {lh} are controlled in the local
frame according to:

of the Cartesian coordinates and Euler angles (the ZYX

, an impossible case of the joint transportation
task).
An intuitive description of the task is to Òkeep the object
on the table from falling offÓ. The control design can be
deÞned to attract the object (o) towards an appropriate
desired goal point (d) (refer to Fig. 3). To realize this task,
direct force application on the object is not possible, since
the priority is table transportation. Hence, only an indirect
actioncanbeappliedbytiltingthetabletocontrastorexploit

the latter option would make the task uncomfortable for the

To integrate the whole system, the important part is deÞn-

for all 6 DOF. The vision-based control takes care of two
DOF (z,?

). Three DOF (x,y,?

) of the pose are deÞned
from the FSM of our groupÕs earlier work [3], [4] (described
brießy in Section II-B). Finally, the remaining DOF (?

) is
made compliant by setting ?
y,d
= 0.

IV. IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
As explained in Section II-B, the approach is to design
a visual servoing controller to make the robot proactive
throughout the task. Two main components are needed:
visual tracking and the control design.
A. Vision Algorithm
In the HRP-2 robot, RGB-D (color + depth) data is
obtained from an embedded ASUS Xtion device located in
the head. Fig. 4 shows typical data of the task. The aim of
the vision algorithm is to process this raw data into visual
features that can be used for control. An error signal can be

to obtain

o
. A variety of vision algorithms that can do
this may be used, with speed as another consideration. For
example, given the object model and the table model, it is
possible to use a model based tracker. Designing a novel
vision algorithm is not the focus of this work, so we use
well-known methods [17]Ð[19]. Nevertheless, the methods
used here are brießy described for completeness.
Fig. 4. Typical raw data (RGB + Depth images) during the task. Left:
RGB image. Right: Depth image, where dark red?bright red corresponds
to ÒfarÓ?ÒnearÓ and black pixels are regions without data.
The features used here are the centroids of the object
and of the table. The Þrst step is to segment these from
the image. Color segmentation is used in our system. For
example the pink object in Fig. 4 and yellow object in
Fig. 3 can be easily characterized and thresholded by a
speciÞc hue range and a high saturation (from the HSV
color space). To add robustness, morphological operations
(opening and closing) are used to remove outliers. After this,
sliding window detection (sped up using the image pyramids
concept) Þnds the most probable location. The centroid of
the detected blob is (u,v) in pixel coordinates. This is then
converted into
c
x
o
and
c
y

by using the intrinsic camera
calibration parameters (f

algorithm [19] is run in saturation-value-depth space. This
algorithm starts with a ÒseedÓ point and grows the region
basedonaconnectivitycriterionbetweenneighboringpixels.
Here, the seed point is the bottom pixel of the ball. A low
saturation and high value characterize well the ÒwhiteÓ color
of the table. The addition of depth ensures connectivity in
Cartesian space, simplifying for example the segmentation
between table and ßoor pixels. Finally, some morphological
operations(openingandclosing)aredonetoremoveoutliers.
From these segmented points, the Cartesian centroid is used
as
c

t
(a translation vector). The Cartesian coordinates of the
object in the table frame are then obtained by:

The homogeneous transformation matrix

is composed of

and the rotation matrix

. A

which is obtained from proprioception.
B. Vision-Based Control
The control design needs to drive

. Several
existing methods can be used. Here, a simple PD controller
is used such that:
C
i
(s) =K
p,i
+K
d,i
s i ={x,y}. (4)
This choice is justiÞed by analyzing the task using a
simple sliding model (i.e., neglecting friction and angular
momentum). Fig. 5 illustrates the necessary variables for this
analysis. Since a control with z rather than ?
y
is desired, the
trigonometric identity z
r
= l
t
sin?
y
is used, where l
t
is the
length of the table and z
r
is the differential height. z
r
can
be converted to z by a trivial change of frame.

The Lagrangian equation of motion along

Along y, linearization of the Lagrangian equation about

It should be noted that both are double integrators. As such,
they are only marginally stable when feedback controlled
with a Proportional gain. But the Proportional Derivative

The two systems are asymptotically stable if all the roots of
these two polynomials have non-multiple negative real parts.
This condition is veriÞed, for a second order polynomial, if
all the coefÞcients are strictly positive. In the case of the
characteristic polynomials in (9), this is equivalent to:
K

By numerical differentiation ú x (and ú y) is obtained as:
ú x(t) =
x(t)?x(t??t)
?t
,
with ?t the sampling step. Tuning the gains in (11) accord-
ing to (10) guarantees stability of the closed loop system, as
long as the linear approximation is valid. This implies that

However, for ¬ x

V. RESULTS
For the experiments, we chose a ball to be the moving ob-
ject. This makes it similar to a well-studied problem/example
in control theory: the Òball-and-plateÓ system, which is a
2-DOF generalization of the Òtextbook exampleÓ ball-on-
beam system (used to study advanced control methods [20]).
Although similar, signiÞcant differences exist - notably that
collaboration is the main issue here.
Several experiments were performed and with 2 different
balls - a yellow tennis ball which tends to move slower and
a pink ball which moves quite fast. A few different users
also tested this early system, but as the described experience
was similar this is not discussed here. Some experiments are
shown in the accompanying video and in Fig. 6. The video
also shows some results of the vision algorithm detecting
the ball and the table. In the initial experiments, both human
and humanoid stand stationary and balance the ball on the
table. Some disturbance is then introduced (e.g. the ball is
pushed by another person) and the gains of the PD controller
are tuned according to (10) in order to be able to handle
such a disturbance. After ÒlightÓ gain tuning of the vision-
based controller with such experiments, we test the complete
system where the human-humanoid dyad transport the table
with the ball on top. Here, walking introduces a signiÞcant
disturbance that can move the ball. The experiments show
that although the ball moves a lot, it doesnÕt fall off the table
during this transportation task.
From the recorded data of the force/torque sensors in the
HRP-2 wrists, we found that during this task ?
x
(the total
torque about the x-axis of {cf}) averages to about 0 Nm,
which means that this interaction torque with the human
is regulated well. Furthermore, f
z
(again with {cf} as the
reference) averages to about 12N. This means that the robot
carries part of the weight of the table and thus lightens
the burden on the human. Finally, we notice that in both
signals a noticeable oscillation occurs which correlates to
the frequency of the walking gait and the disturbance that it
causes.
VI. DISCUSION ON EQUAL COLLABORATION
The results show that the complete system (Fig. 2b) can
do the job well: the vision-based controller tries to keep the
ball on the table while the impedance controller regulates
interaction forces. A simple analysis of Fig. 2 shows that
a disadvantage of the pure follower (Fig. 2a) is that the
success/failure of the vision task depends solely on the
human partner. SpeciÞcally, the human needs to use his/her
vision to observe the state of the task and then apply a
sufÞcient force to haptically communicate to the robot what
s/he wants to do. Instead, in Fig. 2b the cognitive load of
the task is shared in some capacity - both human and robot
are able to observe the state of the task and act accordingly.
However, this sharing can become a disadvantage when the
human and robot disagree on the state of the task and
the action to take [21]. Experimentally, this is handled in
our system by making the robot more compliant and less
stiff (impedance parameter tuning). This ensures that the
human can always safely impose his/her intention through
the haptic channel. This also shows a possible extension of
the system which is to dynamically change the impedance
parameters: making it more stiff when the robot is more
certain of his observations and more compliant when there
is more uncertainty. In effect, this makes the impedance
parameters a method to weigh the importance between visual
(task knowledge) and haptic (human intention) information
channels. But, it is important to note that this disadvantage
of equal collaboration also applies to human-human pairs
and more generally in teams - ÒteamworkÓ (or the lack of
it). Some preliminary experiments have been made with both
the passive follower and the approach of equal collaboration
and the advantages/disadvantages brießy described here can
be observed by the human collaborator. One difÞculty in
presenting these results is in the use of proper evaluation
methods since the most important aspect - the comfort of the
human collaborator - is very subjective. Another difÞculty
is to separate the contribution of the human and robot.
Althoughintheresultspresentedherethehumanistoldtobe
more ÒpassiveÓ (does not try Òtoo muchÓ to keep the ball on
the table) he also does not try to make the ball fall off, since
teamwork is a factor in the overall result. The resolution of
these issues is left for future work.

VII. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper, a general framework for human-robot joint
collaborative tasks was presented. It uses a visual servoing
controllertorealizethetaskandahapticchanneltorecognize
human intention. Both vision and force control are combined
in the impedance control framework. This is implemented
and tested on a joint transportation task where a human and
humanoid robot carry a table with a freely moving ball on
top. The objective is to transport the table while keeping
the ball from falling off. This task is used to explore some
important issues in robotics: the combination of vision and
force information and the issues concerning collaboration -
safety and effective human-robot collaboration strategies.
To continue the work here, it is planned to further in-
vestigate the combination of vision and force information.
Another major area for continued study is in collaboration,
such as the idea of dynamically changing the impedance pa-
rameters described in Section VI. Further works are to utilize
good statistical methodology and experiments with different
users(usabilitystudy)tobetteranalyzethequalitativeresults.
