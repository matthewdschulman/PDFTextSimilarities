Abstract—Real-time monitoring of elderly movement can 
provide valuable information regarding an individual’s degree 
of functional rehabilitation. Many laboratory-based studies 
have described various gait detection systems with different 
wearable inertial sensors, but only limited number of papers 
addressed the issues by using some non-wearable sensors. A 
practical method of gait information detection and gait analysis 
is proposed in the paper using an inexpensive Microsoft Kinect 
fixed on the midpoint of lower extremity rehabilitation robot. 
The horizontal distances between Kinect plane and every mark 
pasted on lower extremity are acquired. Taken the 
characteristics of gait distance series into consideration, the 
Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA) model is established 
to reflect the changing rule of gait status. Combined with the 
Kalman filter, gait information reflecting rehabilitation status 
at next moment is predicted accurately. The method regarding 
the gait detection and gait analysis is verified by amounts of gait 
experiments finally.  
I. INTRODUCTION 
According to the United Nations Population Division 
statistics, the elderly population has reached 737 million by 
the end of 2009 accounting for 10.8% of the total population, 
and then it may account for 15% of the total population in the 
year 2025[1]. Particularly in the Asia Pacific region the elderly 
population has grown rapidly. In China, people aged over 60 
have reached 178 million, which takes up 13.26% proportion 
of the total population by the end of 2010. In addition, 
Thousands of elderly people caught some mournful diseases 
every year. Aggravation of population aging and high 
proportion of mechanical injury are causing most people to 
lose the walking independently, it doesn’t only reduce the life 
level, but also it puts more heavy burden on the society and 
restricts the rapid growth of national economy. 
It is essential for elderly to have a proper rehabilitation 
training in order to strengthen body function. However, some 
accidental injuries usually come out and most of them do great 
harm to the originally weak body in the rehabilitation process, 
so it is essential to employ diverse sensing devices to monitor 
the whole rehabilitation process. Moreover, it helps evaluate 
the rehabilitation level objectively and prevent the accident 
such as the falls beforehand by combining gait information 
from sensors. Several efficient methods regarding gait 
detection and gait analysis using different kinds of sensors 
have been proposed. Dean M[2] presented a real-time 
classification system for human movement associated with the

data from a waist-mounted tri-axial accelerometer unit and 
achieved the great performance. Michael R[3] proposed a  
waist-mounted tri-axial accelerometer system with a remote 
data collection capability to address the falls detection and 
falls prevention. S Jiang[4] proposed a fall prediction method 
based on the gait analysis algorithm (stability and symmetry of 
gait) by collecting the movements parameters of human 
walking gait from the tri-axial accelerometer. Devon K[5] 
proposed a slip-and-fall detection and prediction device 
designed with Lyapunov method to predict if patient gait 
balance will become chaotic and unstable, indicating that they 
may be at risk of fall. M Gabel[6] presented a novel method 
for full body gait analysis using Kinect sensor, but the Kinect 
skeleton drifted easily to the side and joint measurements of 
the features caused relatively larger errors. T Hu[7] presented 
a systematic approach to modeling a bipedal walker driven by 
joint moments, the holonomic constraint inside the raw model 
obtained by Newton’s law was gradually eliminated through 
characterizing ground reaction force and a set of models with 
no holonomic constraint were obtained for all possible 
situations in a gait cycle. F Iida[8] presented the two-biped 
control architecture for the compass gait model used for 
locomotion in rough terrain and then extended the proposed 
controller with a sensory feedback by self-stability and gait 
variability, which enabled the robot to control gait patterns 
autonomously for traversing a rough terrain. 
Several methods of gait detection and gait analysis by 
some different sensors have been proposed above, but in most 
of which sensors were dressed on the trainers and it probably 
led to increasing additional psychological burden, so it is 
essential to propose some other portable equipment to monitor 
gait status in the rehabilitation process. The paper proposes a 
method of gait detection and gait analysis using the Microsoft 
Kinect, which is fixed on the midpoint of lower limb 
rehabilitation robot with inductive elements backwards. The 
horizontal distances between Kinect and every mark pasted on 
each lower extremity are acquired simultaneously when 
rehabilitation robot followed by the trainer moves along the 
scheming path together. The ARMA model is established 
according to the characteristics of gait distance series and its 
physical meaning. Moreover, gait information at next moment 
is predicted accurately by combining dynamic Kalman filter 
with the output of ARMA model finally. 
II. INFORMATION DETECTION BASED ON KINECT 
The Kinect detection device on the rehabilitation training 
robot is shown in Fig. 1a, which is mainly composed of three 
cameras, the middle one is a general RGB camera, through 
which the RGB information in the view can be obtained, the 
others are an infrared projector and a CMOS infrared camera, 
through which the horizontal distances between all pixels in 
the view and Kinect plane can be obtained directly, namely,

the RGB-D information of any pixel in the view can be 
captured by the Kinect. It is fixed on the midpoint of lower 
limb rehabilitation training robot with the inductive elements 
backwards in order to realize the gait information detection, 
which employs the independent wheeled structure and equips 
with the four stepping motor respectively, so it is used to assist 
trainer in functional enhancement and rehabilitation, as shown 
in Fig. 1b. In order to reduce the calculation and storage, 
several marks are pasted on the frontal surfaces of lower limb 
and each lower limb has half number, the height above the 
ground can be adjusted according to the length of lower limbs, 
and then the horizontal distances between every mark on 
lower limbs and Kinect plane are detected persistently.

III. GAIT SERIES MODELING 
The horizontal distances between every mark pasted on 
lower limbs and Kinect plane are obtained and regarded as the 
gait characteristics, and then an applicable ARMA model is 
established effectively according to the characteristics of gait 
series itself and its physical meanings. 
A.  Overall characteristics of gait series 
Take the distance from one mark for example in order to 
describe the characteristics of gait series. As known to all, 
normal walk activity is carried out with bilateral lower limb 
moving forward alternately along at the constant drive of the 
rehabilitation robot, so the distance between every mark in the 
view and Kinect plane is periodic in theory. However, the 
amplitude of each lower limb relative to the coronal plane is 
random due to the positional uncertainty of the homolateral 
heel striking the ground according to the knowledge of human 
kinematics, in addition, Kinect contains some uncertain noise 
inside. Moreover, the whole walk activity of unilateral lower 
limb is correlative and it can be represented as the linear 
combination of gait information at previous moment and the 
corresponding noise. It is applicable to establish a ARMA 
model for gait series based on the above characteristics. 
B. The basic form of ARMA model 
The basic form of a common ARMA model is expressed as

 represent the seasonal autoregressive 
parameters, seasonal moving average parameters, unseasonal 
autoregressive parameters and unseasonal moving average 
parameters. It is concluded from the above equations that the 
ARMA model doesn’t only eliminate the correlation at an 
identical moment during different cycles, but also eliminates 
the internal correlation at different moments in the identical 
cycle, so it can characterize the changing rules of gait series 
effectively. 
C. Order determination and verification of ARMA model 
? Stationary test and non-stationary processing 
It is essential for gait series to make a stationary test to 
examine the stationarity before determining the basic form of 
the ARMA model. Augmented DF (ADF) test is one of most 
popular stationary methods. The series is non-stationary if 
ADF statistical value is larger than those at the significant 
level of 1%, 5% and 10%, otherwise, the series is stationary. It 
is necessary to make a differential processing if gait series 
doesn’t satisfy the stationary condition of ARMA modeling, 
otherwise, the processing is skipped out to get the stationary 
series. Seasonal differences are carried out if gait series 
appears a seasonal variation and backward differences are 
carried out if it appears an increasing or decreasing variation 
trend on the whole, differential processing aren’t stopped until 
gait series reaches the stationary condition. 
? Model order determination and verification 
Model order is determined in the part after getting the 
stationary series. First of all, the values of autocorrelation 
coefficient (AC) and partial autocorrelation coefficient (PAC) 
at every lagging order are calculated by the Eviews statistic 
software respectively in order to determine the model order. It 
is applicable to establish the ARMA model if the PAC is tailed 
and AC is a seasonal trailing, and then the concrete order of 
ARMA model is specified by counting the total number of 
non-zero AC and PAC at the significant level of 5%. 
It is necessary to verify the overall stationary and validity 
of ARMA model after determining the concrete model order. 
Verification of model residual is employed to calculate the 
residuals between original series and values obtained by the 
ARMA model at the corresponding point. The ARMA model 
is admitted if the probability of Q statistics at every lagging 
order is larger than 0.05, model residual can be regarded as a 
random white noise, the model information is effective to 
reflect the trend and the inverted AR roots as well as MA roots 
are located in the same unit cycle with smaller probability. 
Otherwise, ARMA model order needs to be determined again. 
D. Model parameters estimation by the least square method 
Model parameters are unknown after specifying the model 
order and need to be evaluated by the least square method due

lower limb rehabilitation robot

to its smaller calculation and higher precision. The equation of 
least square method is shown as in 
?= min?

                    (6) 
Where y
i
 and f(x
i
) represent the original gait series and the 
discrete value calculated  by the ARMA model at ith point, n 
represent the total number of date points. The least square 
method can ensure the smaller error square sum and higher 
precision from the equation above. 
The overall characteristics of original series are described, 
which is the premise foundation of establishing an effective 
ARMA model and then stationary test and non-stationary 
processing are carried out in order to get the stationary series. 
The model order is determined by calculating the AF and PAF, 
the validity and stability of ARMA model are verified by the 
white noise test of residual series and the unknown parameters 
are calculated by the least square method finally. 
Gait series modeling is established effectively according to 
the characteristics, but it has the following disadvantages of 
lower predictive precision with low order modeling and high 
estimated difficulty with high order modeling. Kalman filter 
can achieve the higher precision by the recursive estimation. 
However, it causes the difficulty of deducing the state 
equation and measurement equation. So we combine low 
order ARMA model with Kalman filter to predict the gait 
information at next moment dynamically. 
IV. GAIT PREDICTION BY THE KALMAN FILTER 
In order to realize the recursive prediction, the transmation 
from the ARMA model to the state-space equation must be 
done at first, and then Kalman filter is employed to obtain the 
predictive information at next moment. 
A. The linear optimal prediction of Kalman filter 
For a discrete time-invariant linear stochastic system 
X(t?1)=???(t)?? ?w(t)                                                   (7)

First of all, the initial status X(0|0) and initial covariance 
matrix P(0|0) are specified randomly and predictive equations 
of Kalman filter are shown as follows. 
   ?(1|0)= ???(0|0)                                                            (9)

Where y(t), ?(t), K(t), A, Q, T represent the measurement,

Predictive value is obtained with non-linear combination 
of predictive value at the previous moment, Kalman gain and 
measurement at current moment according to the equations 
above. 
V.  EXPERIMENT AND ANALYSIS 
Some relevant experiments are conducted in order to verify 
the availability of the ARMA modeling and accuracy of 
Kalman prediction. Some able-bodied subjects are enrolled 
voluntarily and asked to simulate the elderly to walk along the 
scheming straight path. First of all, eight marks are pasted on 
the lower limbs and each lower limb has half number of 
marks, the location of every mark on the lower limb is shown 
in Fig. 2. Every subject does the following activities many 
times under the same conditions: walk at the speed of 0.34m/s 
and 0.47m/s in order to do walk activity closer to the elderly 
and improve the authenticity of experiments. 
 
 
 
Figure 2.  The location of every mark pasted on lower limb. 
A. Normal walk experiments at the speed of 0.34m/s 
The experiments are made after a period of time and then 
Kinect device is started by the laptop through the USB port, 
the horizontal distances between every mark pasted on each 
lower limb and Kinect plane are acquired at the 12 FPS. The 
distance curves at the speed of 0.34m/s are shown in Fig. 3.

Figure 4.  The distance curves of right marks. 
The horizontal distance between every mark pasted on left 
lower limb and Kinect plane is periodic on the whole from the 
Fig. 3. Amplitude from the first mark pasted on the left limb is 
smaller than that from the second mark pasted on the left limb, 
amplitude from the third mark is smaller that from the fourth 
mark, meanwhile, Amplitude from the third mark is larger 
than that from the second mark, because the thigh rotates 
round the hip joint, but the shank doesn’t only rotate round 
the knee joint, but also it also rotates round the hip joint, so its 
range is severer than the thigh. Meanwhile, the characteristics 
are applied to the right lower limb, which is shown in Fig. 4.  
The series from the first mark on the right limb is taken for 
example in order to verify availability of gait series modeling 
and the accuracy of Kalman prediction, which is marked out 
with red line with the thick width. 
B. Normal walk experiments at the speed of 0.34m/s 
First of all, stationary test must be carried out in order to 
obtain the stationary series and the result by the ADF test is 
shown in the table I. 
TABLE I.  ADF TEST OF ORIGINAL SERIES 
                                                        t-Statistic                    Prob.

The original series is non-stationary according to the table 
I, because ADF test statistic value is larger than those at the 
levels of 1%, 5% and 10%. The gait series have the obvious 
trend on the whole, so it is very essential to make the seasonal 
differences for original gait series, the length of differences 
processing is S=25 and the ADF test of differential 
processing is shown in table II.

The differential series satisfy the stationary condition 
from the table II, because the ADF test statistic value of 
differential series is smaller than those at the levels of 1%, 5%, 
10%, where D=1, d=0. Model order is determined by 
counting the non-zero number of autocorrelation coefficient 
(AC) and partial autocorrelation coefficient (PAC) at every 
lagging order after the stationary processing. The 
autocorrelogram of stationary series is drawn by the Eviews 
software in the Fig. 5. It is concluded that PAC is truncated 
after the lagging second order and AC is tailed after the 
lagging fifth order, so it is applicable to establish the ARMA 
model, whose concrete form is ARMA(2,0,5)?(0,1,0)

It is concluded that the parameters is relatively significant 
and Probability is very small from the table III, meanwhile, 
inverted AR roots as well as MA roots are located in the same 
unit cycle with smallest probability, so the model is stable and 
effective. The comparison between the original series and 
ARMA model series is shown in the Fig. 6 finally, from 
which we can draw the conclusion that ARMA model can 
reflect the overall trend of gait series, so it is effective for gait 
series to establish the ARMA model.

C. Gait prediction by the dynamic filter 
In order to realize the recursive prediction, Kalman filter 
is employed to obtain the predictive value at next moment 
after gait series modeling. First of all, the transformation from 
the ARMA model into state-space model must be conducted, 
and then the curves of original series and Kalman predictive 
series are shown in the Fig. 7.

Figure 7.  Comparison between original series and predictive series. 
Predictive error is relatively large at the beginning from 
the Fig. 7, especially when every lower limb moves to the 
nearest location to the Kinect, predictive error reaches the 
maximum, but it reduces to 0 gradually with the time. 
Because the initial status X(0|0) and covariance matrix P(0|0) 
are specified randomly, so the precision is lower at the first, 
but Kalman predictor can recursively predict the gait 
information beforehand due to its characteristic of 
dynamically modifying the weight. On the other hand, 
measure precision is low when the object is nearer to the 
Kinect, moreover, gait is uncertain in the rehabilitation 
process due to the body functional decline. 
It is applicable for gait series to establish the ARMA 
model and realize the gait information prediction based on the 
ARMA modeling according to the experiment at the speed of 
0.34m/s. 
D.   Normal walk experiment at the seed of 0.47m/s 
Normal walk experiment at the speed of 0.47m/s is 
conducted in order to verify the rationality of gait series 
modeling and accuracy of Kalman filter further. We compare 
with the characteristic variation at the different speed finally. 
The experiment is mainly composed of two sections too. Take 
the distances from first mark pasted on the right lower limb 
for example in order to describe the characteristic of gait 
series, which is marked out with red line with the thick width. 
E.  Gait series modeling 
The curves from four marks on the right limb at the speed 
of 0.47m/s are shown in Fig. 8. The horizontal distances from 
every mark are still periodic on the whole and the relative 
relationships between every two mark have been described 
above, because the former condition is applicable to the latter.

First of all, we also do the stationary test by the ADF 
statistic test and make a differential processing when the 
series is non-stationary. Model order is determined by 
counting the non-zero number of AF and PAF at a significant 
level of 5%. It is concluded that PAC is truncated after the 
second order and AC is tailed after the eleventh order, so it is 
reasonable to establish the ARMA model according to 
characteristic above, the corresponding equation is shown in 
the (15).

The model is verified by the residual test of differential series

Probability is larger than others, so they are removed from the 
equation (15) and the surplus parameters are estimated by the

It is still concluded that the model is stable and effective 
from the table above and then the comparison between the 
original series and ARMA model is shown in the Fig. 9, from 
which we can draw the conclusion that it is applicable for gait 
series to establish the ARMA model to reflect the overall 
changing rule.

F.   Gait prediction by the dynamic filter 
Kalman filter is employed again to obtain the predictive 
information at next moment after the gait series modeling and 
curves of original series and predictive information are 
shown in the Fig. 10.

Figure 10.  Comparison between original and predictive series. 
Predictive error is relatively large at the beginning, but it 
reduces gradually with the time, because Kalman filter can 
recursively predict the gait information beforehand due to the 
superior characteristic of dynamically modifying the weight. 
It is similarly applicable to establish the ARMA model and 
realize the recursive prediction based on the ARMA model 
according to the experiment at the speed of 0.47m/s. 
G.  Characteristic comparison at different speed 
It is concluded that the ARMA modeling according to the 
characteristic of gait series itself can reflect the overall trend 
reasonably at the speed of 0.34m/s and 0.47m/s, although the 
number of data points in a cycle is discrepant at different 
speed and the model order is different. Meanwhile, the 
differences in a cycle due to the different speed can be used to 
identify the motion characteristic. 
VI. CONCLUSION 
A method of gait information detection and gait analysis 
is proposed in the paper by using an inexpensive Microsoft 
Kinect, the horizontal distances between Kinect and every 
mark on each lower extremity are acquired simultaneously 
and accurately in the rehabilitation process, and then ARMA 
model is established in terms of the characteristics of gait 
distance series and its physical meaning. Combined with the 
Kalman filter, gait information at next moment is predicted by 
the model output and the great performance is verified by two 
kinds of experiments finally.
