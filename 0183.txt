A Globally Stabilizing Hybrid Control Algorithm for
Mobile Manipulation Subject to Joint-Space Constraints
Johan Markdahl and Xiaoming Hu
Abstract— This paper proposes a hybrid control algorithm
for mobile manipulation subject to joint-space constraints.
More speciﬁcally, we consider the problem of making the end-
effector of a planar manipulator attached to a nonholonomic
mobile platform reach a set-point or equivalently follow a
given path in workspace by means of kinematic actuation. A
switched control strategy allows the robot to avoid singular joint
conﬁgurations and execute a pseudo-inverse based feedback
using bounded and continuous control signals. The switching
scheme is also utilized to maintain feasible joint conﬁgurations.
Numerical examples provide an intuitive understanding of the
algorithm’s workings.
I. INTRODUCTION
A mobile manipulator combines the unlimited workspace
of a mobile platform with the multiple functionalities of a
manipulator, thus providing a ﬂexible system with a high
degree of manipulability [1]. Wheeled mobile platforms are
generally preferred to those using other means of locomotion
since wheeled robots tend to move faster while consuming
less energy. The wheels of a nonholonomic mobile platform
are of a simpler and more reliable mechanical design than
those of a mobile platform capable of omnidirectional mo-
tion. The nonholonomic motion constraints do however pose
challenges to a control engineer. For example, a consequence
of Brockett’s theorem is that the pose of nonholonomic vehi-
cles cannot be stabilized to a point by means of a continuous
time-invariant feedback [2]. Still, there is a considerable
literature on the subject of control of nonholonomic vehicles
and mobile manipulators with nonholonomic platforms, see
e.g. [3] and the references therein.
This paper proposes an inverse kinematics based feedback
linearization approach to the problem of end-effector (EE)
path following for mobile manipulators subject to joint-space
constraints. The problem of inverse kinematics based control
has a long history of study, a sample of works are [4], [5], [6],
and [7]. A related problem is that of redundancy resolution
as studied in e.g. [6], [8], [9], [10], and [11]. Redundancy
arises when a task requires less degrees of freedom than those
possessed by the manipulator. Some degrees of freedom
are thus left unspeciﬁed and can be utilized to achieve
objectives of secondary (or lower) priority. The key idea is
to project the control laws corresponding to those objectives
on the nullspace of the manipulator Jacobian [3] (or a block
Jacobian in the case of mobile manipulation [7], [8], [10]).
This work was supported by the Swedish Foundation for Strategic
Research (SSF) through the Centre for Autonomous Systems (CAS) at KTH.

and Systems Theory, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm,

Multiple objectives of successively lower priority can be
accommodated by repeating this procedure [9], [11].
Issues that have been addressed concerning inverse kine-
matics based algorithms and priority based methods include:
(i) the pseudo-inverse becoming unbounded as the manip-
ulator approach a singular conﬁguration, (ii) a low priority
objective does not belong to the nullspace and cannot be met
exactly, and (iii) there may be a conﬂict between objectives
of different priority. The case of (i) can be addressed using
optimization techniques such as damped least-squares [4],
[6], but is sometimes left outside the scope of the work even
though it is of critical importance [5], [7]. Issue (ii) can be
addressed approximately by use of a least squares approach
[7], or be resolved by a technique that avoids inversion
[6], or (for joint-limits avoidance) by deﬁning a weighted
pseudo-inverse using nonlinear optimization [5]. Sufﬁcient
conditions for convergence using a high gain approach in the
case of (iii) is given in [11]. However, the combined approach
of exact cancellation and gains of different magnitudes may
be sensitive to noise and modeling errors, making lower
priority objectives conﬂict with higher ones in practice.
The algorithm we propose is an inverse-kinematic based
control law for stabilization of the EE position that also guar-
antees the achievement of two additional objectives, namely
singularity-avoidance and joint-space constraint satisfaction.
The chosen approach separates the inverse kinematics based
control from singularity avoidance and joint-space constraint
satisfaction in time by means of a switched control strategy.
One advantage of this separation is a kind of inverse optimal-
ity: if, at any time, the desired set-point can be reached along
a line in workspace without any joint self-motion (although
the joint conﬁgurations must be feasible and at a sufﬁcient
distance from singularities), then, for the remainder of time,
the set-point will be approached along a geodesic curve in
workspace. Moreover, if the initial condition do not satisfy
these requirements, then the mobile manipulator will reach
a state which does.
Our main motivation for developing the proposed algo-
rithm is to solve the cooperative manipulation problem of
stabilizing the pose of an object that has been grasped by
multiple mobile manipulators as addressed in our previous
works [12], [13]. The paper [12] mainly considers the aspect
of distributed control, using standard inverse kinematics
based manipulator control techniques to establish asymptot-
ical stability of the object pose. Its main contribution is to
provide a distributed algorithm for object pose control that
scales linearly with the number of agents. The work [13]
uses a singularity-free but discontinuous switched control

approach to establish global asymptotical stability. Its main
contribution is to rigorously prove convergence results that
are valid on a global scale.
This paper extends the algorithm of [12] and [13] to
the case of (i) a larger class of mobile manipulators, (ii)
continuous feedback control, and (iii) the satisfaction of
rather general joint-space constraints. The problem of EE
path following for a single mobile manipulator is, in a way,
a special case of the cooperative manipulation problem. As
such, the proposed algorithm differs from that of [5], [7],
by providing a guarantee that the inverse kinematics are
well deﬁned. It also differs from works such as [6], [7],
in guaranteeing the satisfaction of joint-space constraints
without requiring the system to be redundant (note however
that the proposed approach is compatible with priority-based
task assignment).

II. SYSTEM DESCRIPTION
We make the following assumptions regarding the robotic
system.
Assumption 1 (Robotic System): The manipulator has a
known, open kinematic chain and is planar. Its joints are
fully actuated. The ﬁrst joint is revolute and is situated on
the line that connects the midpoint of the platform’s both
drive wheels. The feasible joint conﬁgurations belong to the
set
F ={g(q)≤0|q ?T(n)?P(k)}, (4)
where g is such that F is connected, cl(int(F)) = F ,
q
1
is unconstrained, and there exists a desired operating
conﬁguration q
?
? F which is characterized by a high
manipulability index [3]. Also, any prismatic joint q
i
is
constrained by q
i
? [a
i
,b
i
] with a
i
,b
i
? R. The platform
is nonholonomic of unicycle type, an example of which is
the differential-drive vehicle [3].
Remark 1: Assumption 1 is more general than the cor-
responding assumption in [13] and may include dual-arm
mobile manipulators like the one illustrated in Fig. 2. In
[13] we only consider nR manipulators but the introduction
of (4) allows us to include prismatic joints without having
to address the theoretical issue of their extension becoming
unbounded.

Assumption 1 runs diagonally through the ﬁgure. The joints
are subject to linear constraints

Before presenting the system model we make a key
assumption regarding the control system.
Assumption 2 (Control System): Control of the manipula-
tor and the platform is carried out on a kinematic level and
is a bounded, continuous function of time.
Remark 2: Assumption 2 is more restrictive than the
corresponding assumption in [13] but also more realistic
since we do not allow discontinuous feedback.

III. PROBLEM STATEMENT
Consider System 1 under Assumption 1–2. Our goal is to
design a bounded, continuous feedback control that steers an
operational point, which we chose to be the EE, to a desired
set-point from any initial condition while at the same time
avoiding any singular manipulator conﬁgurations. There is
no loss of generality in assuming the set-point to be the
origin. Note that the seemingly more general problem of
EE path following can also be solved by such a control law
under rather mild additional assumptions using a feedforward
technique.
IV. CONTROL ALGORITHM
The proposed solution to the problem described in §III will
ﬁrst be outlined in §IV-A and then be given an in-depth
description in §IV-B–IV-E.
A. Switched control strategy
Inverse kinematics based task space control is a form of
feedback linearization and suffers from the limitations as-
sociated with such an approach. Stability results can be
established on a local level but the system may not be
globally asymptotically stable and can even display ﬁnite
escape time. To avoid the input norm growing unboundedly
as the manipulator approaches a singular conﬁguration we
modify the inverse kinematics based approach by making
use of a switched control strategy.
The discrete state ? of the system switches between four
modes which we refer to as the EE mode (e), manipulator
mode (m), mobile platform mode (p), and transition mode
(t). The following switching sequences are allowed e ?
t ? m, m ? t ? e, m ? t ? p, and p ? t ? m.
The switching modes are grouped as T = {e}, J = {m,p}
where T corresponds to task space control and J to joint-
space control in the sense that the EE position is ﬁxed in J.
The switching mode t is transient since it only serves as a
passage between other modes. An illustration of the overall
switching scheme is provided in Fig. 3.
The switching is state and time dependent. The mode e is
where the robot performs the main task of stabilizing the EE
position. A robot executes the switch e ? t ? m when
its manipulator is close to a singular conﬁguration or an
unfeasible conﬁguration and the reverse switch m?t?e
when said manipulator is at sufﬁcient distance from such
conﬁgurations to resume its work. The modem is hence about
improving the manipulability of the manipulator conﬁgura-
tion. The mode t is used to connect the control signals u
?
i
for i ? {e,j,m}, ? ? {e,m,p} in a continuous fashion,
thereby circumventing the discontinuity that a direct switch
between these modes could result in. The switchm?t?p
is executed when the nonholonomic motion constraints of the
platform prevent the robot from approaching a manipulator
conﬁguration that is characterized by a good manipulability
index, i.e. is far from a singularity. A robot inp will readjust
the orientation of its mobile platform whereafter it executes
the switch p?t?m.

B. The end-effector mode
In end-effector mode (e) we want to achieve the main task of
moving the EE to its desired set-point position. This is done
using pseudo-inverse based control in work space. Introduce
the constraints

where? and?

are strictly positive constants and† denote the
Moore-Penrose inverse operator. Note that condition (11) is
stricter than the requirement on joint conﬁguration feasibility
made in Assumption 1. Condition (10) is an important step
towards formalizing the requirement of bounded control

and ? cannot
be done arbitrarily, but must take kJ

k and F into account.
The switched control of [13] is autonomous but depends
discontinuously on the states. The use of an instantaneous
switch simpliﬁes the switching criteria. In this paper we need
to predict the possibility of (10) being violated and initiate
the switch prior to this happening.

an illustration of the former case is provided in Fig. 4. Con-
dition (12) implies that the robot leavese whenever the norm
of its manipulator Jacobian grows close to an upper bound ?
or when the joints are close to within a lower distance ?

of
an infeasible conﬁguration. Note that condition (12) covers
both boundary and internal singularities [14].

The constraints (10), (12) are soft in the sense that they
can be violated when ? ? {m,p} (note however that the
constraint (11) is hard for all?). To make sure that (10) is not
violated in the transition phase t of the switch e?t?m
when pseudo-inverse based control is still being applied, we
set0 < ?
?
< ? so thatkJ
†
k may exceed?
?
without exceeding
?. Likewise we set 0 < ?
e
< ?
e?
so that d(q,F
c
) may
decrease in t without falling below ?
e
.
The time spent in t is designed to be a constant number
??
t
(see §IV-E). Hence ??
t
,?
?
, and ?
e?
should be chosen
so that the maximum rate of change of q cannot lead to a
violation of (10)–(11) before ??
t
time units have passed
after that the switch has been initiated. More speciﬁcally, ?
?
and?

are such thatkJ

The switching logic guarantees thatkJ

. Stated another way, we have
used a feedback linearization to obtain
˙ p

e
e
, (14)
where u
e
e
is a bounded, continuous virtual input signal that
does not directly correspond to any physical actuator. The
input u
e
e
can be chosen to make the EE move towards the
desired set-point using standard techniques.
Remark 3: In order to solve the path following problem,
the path needs to be parametrized by a variable that only
evolves when ? =e and in the ﬁrst half of the switch e?
t ? m so that the error vector connecting the end-effector
with its desired position remains constant when ? ?{m,p}.
C. The manipulator mode
In manipulator mode (m) we want to restore (12) (with some
additional margin) in ﬁnite time without moving the EE.
Introduce the constraint
˙ p
e
=u
p
e
=0. (15)
The purpose of (15) is to avoid having the control in m
interfere with the progress in e towards the goal of making
the EE reach its desired set-point.
A robot switches m?t?e when
q ? B
?
m?(q
?
), (16)
whereq
?
? F is a joint conﬁguration characterized by a high
manipulability index [3] and ?
m?
is a small positive number.
The ?
m?
is introduced so that q can come sufﬁciently close
to q
?
in ﬁnite time using a large class of control laws u
m
q
(not necessarily ﬁnite time convergent control).
The idea is to pick a q
?
and bring q sufﬁciently close to
it before switching to e so that the next switch e?t?m
do not occur until after at least a time ??
e
> 0 have passed
wherefore a minimum of progress in the objective of moving
the EE can be made after every switching sequence of the
form e ? t ? m ? ... ? m ? t ? e. Stated in another
way, the system has a dwell time ??
e
in e. Almost global
asymptotical stability of the desired objective can then be
established by formulating the switching logic for? ?{m,p}
such that the system always returns to e [13], i.e. ? =e for
inﬁnitely long time.
This requires that q
?
of the condition (16) is chosen such
that kJ
†
(q
?
)k < ?
?
and d(q
?
,F
c
) > ?
e?
holds with some
margin since there will then be a dwell time ??
e
in e.
More precisely, for some ??

such that

D. Mobile platform mode
In mobile platform mode (p) we want to change the platform
pose in ﬁnite time so that the system can return to performing
manipulator mode control. Introduce the constraints
˙ p

p
e

˙ q
i

The purpose of (19)–(20) is to avoid having the control in
p interfere with the progress in e and m towards the goal
of making the EE reach its desired set-point and the joint
variables approach q

respectively.
The switch p?t?m occurs when

where ?

achieved by changing Re

as explained below. The fact that ?

assures us that
there is a dwell time ??

in m (or at least during switching
sequences that do not include e).

E. Transition mode
In transition mode (t) we want to connect the input signals
of the previous mode (?) with that of the next (?) in a
continuous fashion. This is done by multiplying all signals
by a time-dependent gain g(t), essentially ramping down the
previous signal to zero and then ramping up the next signal
to its value at the current states.
Consider the case of a switching sequence ? ? t ? ?
where the switch ? ?t takes place at time ?. Then

where ??

is a positive constant corresponding to half the
time spent in t and g : [0,2??
t

continuous function that satisﬁes, g(0) = 1, g(??

) = 0,
and g(2??

and respects the constraints due to F being convex. The
algorithm performed as required.
Consider the case of an initial condition p

in particular we set ?

again. Note from Fig. 8
that kJ
†
k approaches the value 5 at time 1.5. This does not
risk a violation of the norm constraint since ? = m at that
time (the joint constraints are never close to being violated).
The motion sequence consisting of the manipulator reach-
ing out followed by the platform repositioning itself is
repeated three times (the number of separate intervals on
which ? = e in Fig 8). It is occurs due to the choice of
u
e
v
= u
e
?
= 0. Setting the mobile platform inputs to zero
is sometimes reasonable in practice, for example if the EE
is to follow a path which lies close to the platform most
of the time. For most tasks it will however be beneﬁcial to
use nonzero controls u
e
v

. Also note the two manipulator
conﬁgurations in Fig. 7 that are similar to the one in Fig.
5. They occur at times instances that correspond to the two
occasions ? =p in Fig. 8.
