Abstract— This paper presents a methodology to analyze
the assembly conditions of parallel manipulators and compute
the maximum pose errors of their moving platform, while
considering geometric errors, joint clearances, link ﬂexibility
and joint elasticity. First, the proposed methodology consists in
determining the zone(s) of the manipulator workspace in which
the manipulator can be assembled assuming that its links and
joints are rigid, while taking into account geometric errors
and joint clearances. Then, the minimum energy required
to assemble the manipulator in the non-assembly zone(s) is
computed, while considering link ﬂexibility and joint elasticity.
The maximum pose errors of the moving-platform are also
computed throughout the manipulator workspace. Finally, a
two-dof spatial parallel manipulator, named IRSbot-2, is used
as an illustrative example.
I. INTRODUCTION
Accuracy is one of the key features that favor robotic ma-
nipulators for many industrial applications. Superior levels
of accuracy are achieved by controlling or measuring all
possible sources of errors on the pose of the moving platform
of a robotic manipulator. Among the most important sources
of errors, we ﬁnd manufacturing errors, assembly errors,
compliance in the mechanical architecture, resolution of the
servoactuators, backlash in the reductors, and clearances in
the joints. Parallel manipulators are usually assumed to be
more accurate than their serial counterparts. However, this
accuracy can be affected by the joint clearances required
for the assembly of the manipulators. The focus of this
paper is the impact of geometric errors, joint clearances, link
ﬂexibility and joint elasticity on the assembly conditions of
parallel manipulators and on the maximum pose errors of
their moving platform.
Geometric errors are caused by the imperfect fabrication
and assembly of the elements of the robot. Their effect
on accuracy is usually measurable and repeatable, and can
therefore be compensated through appropriate calibration.
The relative motions of the two parts of a joint with
clearance may cause undesirable effects such as moving-
platform pose errors [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], impacts, wear,

vibrations and noise [6], [7]. Their inﬂuence on the behaviour
of the manipulator is not repeatable and therefore difﬁcult to
model and to calibrate, and reducing them usually leads to
high manufacturing costs.
If the stiffness of the links and of the joints is not sufﬁcient,
their deformation will be able to cause a notable effect on
the accuracy of the manipulator, especially when subjected
to heavy loads or at high speeds [8], [9], [10]. The Virtual
Joint Model (VJM) approach is convenient to deal with link
ﬂexibility and joint elasticity in robotic manipulators [11],
[12], [13].
This paper introduces a methodology to analyse the as-
sembly conditions of parallel manipulators and compute
the maximum pose errors of their moving platform, while
considering geometric errors, joint clearances, link ﬂexibility
and joint elasticity. First, the proposed methodology consists
in determining the zone(s) of the manipulator workspace in
which the manipulator can be assembled assuming that its
links and joints are rigid, while taking into account geometric
errors and joint clearances. Then, the minimum energy
required to assemble the manipulator in the non-assembly
zone(s) is computed, while considering link ﬂexibility and
joint elasticity. The maximum pose errors of the moving-
platform are also computed throughout the manipulator
workspace. By applying the method for different sets of
parameters (clearances, maximum geometric errors, stiffness
of joints and links) it is possible to choose the best option
with regard to accuracy and internal deformations.
The novelty of this method resides in the fact that many
sources of inaccuracies are considered at the same time, and
in the fact that it provides not only an estimate of the pose
error, but also of the internal forces of the manipulator in
different conﬁgurations. Existing studies mainly focus on one
element (joint clearances, geometric errors, or ﬂexibilities)
and provide methods only for accuracy analysis or force
analysis.
Section II deals with the modeling of geometric errors,
joint clearances, link ﬂexibility and joint elasticity. Sec-
tion III describes the method used to compute the assembly
zones, the minimum assembly energy, the reaction wrench
on the moving-platform and the maximum pose errors of
the moving-platform throughout the manipulator workspace.
Section IV provides an illustrative example in order to
highlight the contributions of the paper.

II. MODELING GEOMETRIC ERRORS, JOINT CLEARANCES
AND FLEXIBILITIES
A. Frame Conventions and Nomenclature
Parallel manipulators withm legs are considered. Each leg
comprises n
i
joints and B
i
loops. A ﬁxed base frame F
0
,
common to all the legs, is arbitrarily deﬁned. A frameF
p
is
attached to the moving-platform of the manipulator. All the
other frames, attached to the joints and the end effectors of
the legs, are denotedF
i,j
, j = 1...N
i
. Each frame has only
one antecedent frame, whose index is denoted as ant(i,j).
WhenF
i,j
is attached to a joint, it is deﬁned according to the
Denavit-Hartenberg convention: axisz
i,j
is along the axis of
the joint, and axisx
i,j
is along the common normal to axes
z
ant(i,j)
and z
i,j
. The frame attached to the end-effector of
legi is denotedF
i,e
. When the manipulator is assembled, the
frames attached to the end-effectors of the legs coincide with
the frame attached to the platform, so that F
i,e
? F
p
,i =
1...m. Each loop is cut at a passive joint, and the frames
that are attached to the two cut ends of the k-th loop of
leg i are denoted F
i,ka
and F
i,k
b
. These two frames should
coincide once the manipulator is assembled, i.e., F
i,ka
?
F
i,k
b
. The transformation matrix from F
ant(i,j)
to F
i,j
is
denoted T
i,j
, while the corresponding rotation matrix and
translation vector are denoted R
i,j
and t
i,j
, respectively.

B. Geometric Errors
The geometric errors of the jth link of leg i are supposed
to be small and measurable. They are represented by the
small displacement screw ?l
i,j
as shown in Fig. 1.
C. Joint Clearances
Intuitively, clearances in a joint are best modeled by
bounding its associated errors below and above. Clearances
in the jth joint of leg i are represented by the small
displacement screw ?c
i,j
as shown in Fig. 1. Assuming that
the lower and upper bounds are the same, this generally
yields six parameters that bound the error screw ?c
i,j
. In
the case of a revolute joint, however, we can take advantage
of the axisymmetry to reduce the number of parameters to
four, grouped in vector c

D. Link Flexibility
The elasticity of the links is modelled by using the Virtual
Joint Model (VJM) [11]. At the end of each elastic link a
6-DoF virtual elastic joint is added, while the link itself is
considered rigid. The virtual elastic joint behaves as a 6-
DoF spring with elastic properties similar to those of the
corresponding link.
It is assumed that the virtual elastic joint coordinates have
inﬁnitesimal values, and can therefore be expressed by a
6-dimensional small displacement screw ?e
i,j
as shown in
Fig. 1. To a particular value of ?e
i,j
, a virtual elastic joint
reaction wrench w
Ei,j
and a potential energy E
Ei,j
are
associated. Since the deformations of the links are assumed
to be small, a linear relation exists between the virtual elastic
joint reaction wrench and the virtual elastic joint coordinates,
deﬁned by a 6?6 stiffness matrix K

The stiffness matrix K

can be evaluated using FEA-
based methods, considering the real geometry of the link,
or analytically, by approximating the link with a simple
shape. Here, all links are approximated by beams with full
circular cross-section. The parameters required to compute
the stiffness matrix of a link are its radius r, its Young
modulus E, and its Poisson’s ratio ?.
E. Joint Elasticity
To model the joint elasticity, a virtual 6-DoF elastic
joint is added after the virtual joint clearance. The small
displacement screw, reaction wrench, potential energy and
stiffness matrix associated with the elasticity of the jth joint
of leg i are denoted ?b

Moreover, each loop is cut as described in Sec. II-A. The

The superscripts (k

ric errors and the virtual joint coordinates in the path from
the base to the ﬁrst and second cut ends of the k-th loop
must be considered.
G. Assembly Constraints
In order to assemble the manipulator, the end-effectors of
the legs must coincide, as well as the cut ends of every loop.
It means that the errors in the pose of the corresponding
frames must be equal. The following assembly constraints
must therefore be satisﬁed:
?x
p|0

p|0
denotes the small displacement screw representing the
error on the moving-platform pose inF

. It is composed of
a rotational part ?x
Rp|0
and of a translational part ?x
T|0
.
III. COMPUTING THE ASSEMBLY ZONES, THE MINIMUM
ASSEMBLY ENERGY AND THE MAXIMUM POSE ERRORS
This section describes the developed methodology to com-
pute the assembly zones, the minimum assembly energy that
is necessary to assemble the manipulator outside them, and
the errors on the moving platform pose. In this section, the
expression clearance constraints refers to the constraints (2)
to (5). The expression assembly constraints refers to the
constraints (19) and (20).
A. Computing the Assembly Zones
The following constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) is
formulated in order to compute the assembly zones of
parallel manipulators:
variables ?x
p|0
,?c
i,j
,i = 1...m,j = 1...N
i
(21)
constraints clearance constraints
assembly constraints
The constraints form a convex set. Therefore, problem (21)
can be solved by convex programming techniques [14].
In the formulation of the assembly constraints only the
small displacement screws related to geometric errors ?l
i,j
and joint clearances ?c
i,j
are considered. Solving this prob-
lem allows to determine whether it is possible, in a given
4069
conﬁguration, to assemble the manipulator by exploiting joint
clearances only. This is equivalent to say that the manipulator
can be assembled without deforming its links and joints and,
therefore, without introducing any internal stress.
B. Computing the Minimum Assembly Energy
The following optimization problem is formulated in order
to compute the minimum assembly energy:
minimize E =

,?e

,?b
i,j
,i = 1...m,j = 1...N
i
subject to clearance constraints
assembly constraints
The objective function of problem (22) is the elastic poten-
tial energy of the manipulator. Its minimization makes sense
from a physical point of view, since in theory the manipulator
should be naturally assembled in a conﬁguration in which the
elastic potential energy is a minimum. The objective to be
minimized is a convex quadratic function. The constraints
of the optimization problem at hand form a convex set. The
minimum energy problem is therefore in the most general
case a convex second order-cone programming (SOCP) that
can be solved by convex optimization techniques [14].
Inside the assembly zones this problem ﬁnds a minimum
equal to zero, since there is no need to deform links
and joints. Outside the assembly zones the limits of the
joint clearances are reached, and therefore it is necessary
to deform links and joints to assemble the manipulator
and the minimum energy required to assemble the parallel
manipulator is not null.
C. Elastic Reaction Wrench on the Moving-platform
If the legs of the manipulator are simple serial chains, the
elastic reaction wrench on the end-effector of leg i,w
i,e
, can
be computed with the following expression [11]:
w

andw

are the reaction wrenches associated to the
link and joint deformations, respectively. The values of the
screws ?e
i
and ?b
i
are found by solving problem (22).
Once the reaction wrenches applied on the end-effectors
of the single legs are known, the total reaction wrench
applied on the moving-platform, denoted w
p
, is computed
by summing them, since the end-effectors are coincident:

(26)
wherem
p
andf
p
are the reaction force and moment applied
at the geometric center of the moving-platform, respectively.
In the case the parallel manipulator has parallelogram
joints, the latter can be replaced by single links having
equivalent elastic properties as explained in [13].
D. Computing the Maximum Pose Error
Two distinct problems are formulated, one to ﬁnd the
maximum orientation error and one to ﬁnd the maximum
position error of the moving platform:
minimize ?r

subject to clearance constraints
assembly constraints
The objective function is the opposite of the square of the
orientation error r or of the position error t of the moving-
platform expressed in frame F
0
. The link ﬂexibilities ?e
i,j
and joint elasticities ?b
i,j
are not part of the decision
variables. However, they appear in the expressions of the as-
sembly constraints. Their values are taken from the solution
of the minimum assembly energy problem (22). This allows
us to determine the maximum pose error of the moving-
platform in every point of the manipulator workspace, even
outside the assembly zones that are deﬁned assuming that
the links and joints are rigid.
The objective to be minimized is a concave quadratic
function, while the constraints form a convex set. The max-
imum error problems is therefore a nonconvex quadratically
constrained quadratic programs (QCQPs). To solve them,
special techniques are required. Here, a branch and bound
algorithm is used [15]. The branch and bound algorithm does
not provide a single value as a result, but two values that
bound the real error from below and above. It is possible to
arbitrarily choose the tolerance ? representing the maximum
distance between these bounds.
IV. CASE STUDY: IRSBOT-2
A. Description of the IRSbot-2
The IRSbot-2 (IRCCyN Spatial Robot with 2 Degrees of
Freedom) is a parallel manipulator designed for fast and
accurate pick and place operations in a two-dimensional
workspace [16]. The IRSbot-2 shown in Fig. 4 is expected
to reach an acceleration up to 20 G and an accuracy equal to
20 µ m throughout a parallelepiped of 800 mm side length.
The base and the moving-platform are connected by two
legs. Each leg is composed of a proximal module and a
distal module mounted in series. The proximal module is
a parallelogram, made up of four revolute joints of axes
perpendicular to the (x
0
,z
0
) plane. One of the link is ﬁxed
with respect to the base frame F
0
, allowing the opposite
link, connected to the elbow, to have a constant orientation
with respect to it. The distal module is made up of two links
connected to the elbow and to the base by universal joints.
The universal joints can be represented by two revolute joints
whose axes are perpendicular to each other and intersect.
The axes of both joints are perpendicular to the link they are
connected to. Some of these joints are compliant, and have
no clearance but can be deformed elastically. Four planes,
parallel to each other, are deﬁned (see Fig. 4): a base plane

, a platform planeP

, and two elbow planesP

Fig. 4. Parameterization of the IRSbot-2.
The IRSBot-2 has two legs (m = 2), each with twelve
joints (n
1
= n
2
= 12) and two loops (B
1
= B
2
= 2). Four
additional frames are added to each leg of the manipulator
in order to simplify its parametrization. In total, N
i
= 21
frames are deﬁned for each leg. The geometric parameters
that are necessary to completely deﬁne the architecture of a
leg are deﬁned as follows (Fig. 4):
• b is the distance between the ﬁrst joint of the parallel-
ogram and the origin of the base frame.
• d is the length of the ﬁxed side of the parallelogram.
• L
1
is the length of the moving side of the parallelogram.
•

f g e

T
is the vector describing the position of
the universal joints with respect to the ends of the
parallelogram joints, expressed in the base frame.
• L
2
is the length of the links of the distal module.
•

p a 0

T
is the vector describing the position of the
platform with respect to the last universal joints of the
links of the distal module, expressed in the base frame.
• ? is the angle between the platform plane and the link
of the parallelogram that is ﬁxed to the base.
• ? and ?
d
are the azimuth and altitude angles that
describe the orientation of the second revolute joint of
each universal joint with respect to the ﬁrst one.
The nominal geometric parameters of the IRSbot2 are the
following: a = 50 mm; b = 83 mm; d = 106 mm; e =
3.342 mm; f = 80 mm; g = 166 mm; p = 50 mm; L

In the scope of this paper, the proximal modules are
considered perfect in order to reduce the computational
times. Therefore, all screws ?l
i,j
, ?c
i,j
, ?e
i,j
, and ?b
i,j
are
null for j = 1...4.
The screws ?l
i,j
are null for j6= 5,8,11,14,19,21 (these

All joints are considered axi-symmetric for the determina-
tion of the clearance constraints. The screws ?c

are null
forj6= 7,8,13,14. These frames are not associated to a joint
or are associated to a compliant joint without clearance. The
other joint clearance constraints are deﬁned by Eq. (1) with

The screws ?e
i,j
are null for j6= 8,14. Only the two long
links of the distal modules are assumed to be ﬂexible. The
Young modulus is set as E = 6·10
10
Pa, the Poisson’s ratio
as ? = 0.3, and the radius of the links as r = 40 mm.
The screws ?b
i,j
are null for j 6= 6,9,12,15, as these
joints are not compliant. For the other joints the stiffness
matrix is deﬁned as follows, according to the technical data

The optimization problems deﬁned in Sec. III are solved
over the full half-workspace for y ≤ 0, on points sampled
with a step of 25 mm along both the x
0
and z
0
axes. The
tolerance for the branch and bound algorithm is set to ? =

the position errors.
B. Results
Figure 5 shows the assembly zones, the minimum assem-
bly energy and the upper bounds of the maximum orientation
and position errors of the moving-platform for the IRSbot-2.
The error plots are given for both the complete case and for
a case where only joint clearances are considered (the screws
?l
i,j
, ?e
i,j
, and ?b
i,j
are all set to zero).
For the chosen geometric errors, assembling the manipula-
tor presents many difﬁculties in many areas of the workspace.
The minimum assembly energy is high throughout the whole
manipulator workspace, and the components of the wrench
associated to the maximum assembly energy point have
very large values. In such a case, the manipulator cannot
be assembled. Therefore, the dimensional tolerances of the
geometric parameters for the real robot should be lower than
those selected for this simulation.
When all screws are considered, the error is relatively high,
and its distribution does not present any regularity. When
only joint clearances are considered, the error has instead a
regular and symmetric distribution and reaches lower values.

Fig. 5. Assembly zones (top-left). Minimum assembly energy (top-
right). Upper bounds of the maximum orientation errors (centre-left) and of
the maximum position errors (centre-right) of the moving-platform, while
considering geometric errors, joint clearances and link ﬂexibilities. Upper
bounds of the maximum orientation errors (bottom-left) and of the maximum
position errors (bottom-right) of the moving-platform, while considering
joint clearances only.
The contribution to the pose error of the clearance dis-
placements usually has a symmetric distribution, because
clearance boundaries are symmetric and equal for all joints
from one leg to the other one. On the contrary, the contribu-
tion to the pose error of the geometric errors is irregular
throughout the manipulator workspace because the small
displacement screws associated to the geometric errors differ
for every frame in the manipulator. Here, the order of
magnitude of the geometric errors is larger than the order of
magnitude of the clearance boundaries. Therefore, the regular
contribution of the clearance displacements is negligible and
is masked by the more relevant and irregular contributions
of the geometric errors.
V. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
A method to determine the assembly energy, the internal
elastic reaction wrenches and the maximum pose error of
parallel manipulators subject to geometric errors, joint clear-
ances, link ﬂexibility and joint elasticity has been developed
and applied to a two-dof spatial parallel manipulator, named
IRSbot-2.
It has been shown that outside the assembly zones, as
expected, links are bent and the assembly energy increases
smoothly. The maximum error on the moving-platform pose
has different contributions due to geometric errors, clear-
ances and ﬂexibilities. The pose error due to joint clearances
has a regular and symmetric distribution throughout the
manipulator workspace, due to the symmetry of the clearance
bounds and of the legs. The pose error due to geometric
errors and elasticity displacements, on the contrary, is highly
irregular due to the asymmetry of the geometric errors from
one leg to the other one.
This research work opens the way to many further devel-
opments. First of all, the proposed method can be applied
to other manipulators and used to analyse the kinematic
behaviour of the manipulators close to their parallel sin-
gularities. Secondly, the error on the moving-platform pose
can be studied statistically in order to determine the most
probable error instead of the worst-case error. The method
lacks experimental validations due to the difﬁculty of tak-
ing the necessary measurements on real manipulators. An
experimental validation will prove that the results provided
by the developed method are realistic and reliable. Finally, it
would be relevant to relate the assembly energy to the stress
in the links in order to verify that the links do not break with
their deformations required for the assembly of the parallel
manipulator.
