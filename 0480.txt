Segregation of Multiple Heterogeneous Units in a Robotic Swarm
Vinicius Graciano Santos Luciano C. A. Pimenta Luiz Chaimowicz
Abstract— Several natural systems adopt self-sorting mecha-
nisms based on segregative behaviors. Among these, cell segre-
gation is of particular interest since it plays an important role
in the formation of tissues, organs, and living organisms. The
Differential Adhesion Hypothesis states that cells naturally seg-
regate because of differences in afﬁnity, which lead similar cells
to strongly adhere to each other. By exploring this principle, we
propose a controller that can segregate a heterogeneous swarm
of robots according to the characteristics of each agent, such
that similar robots form homogeneous teams and dissimilar
robots are segregated. We apply LaSalle’s Invariance Principle
to show convergence and perform simulated experiments in
order to demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of the
proposed controller. Results show that our approach allows
a swarm of multiple heterogeneous robots to segregate in a
coherent and smooth fashion, without any inter-agent collisions.
I. INTRODUCTION
Swarm robotics studies multi-agent systems which consist
of a large number of relatively simple robots. These agents
can solve complex problems by relying on system-level prop-
erties such as robustness, ﬂexibility, and scalability [1]. Most
researchers in swarm robotics usually focus on homogeneous
systems, in which all robots have the same characteristics.
However, several applications of multi-robot and swarm
systems require the use of heterogeneous teams of agents in
order to fulﬁll a given mission, as sometimes it is not possible
to integrate all of the required sensing and actuation capa-
bilities for the task in a single robot. These heterogeneous
systems are specially useful on cooperative assignments such
as search and rescue, surveillance, perimeter protection, and
transportation of large objects.
In some cases, heterogeneous agents must be able to
organize themselves in a speciﬁc manner to carry out their
assigned tasks. For instance, robots that gather distinct types
of materials may need to form teams which can maximize
the gathering of a particular resource. One strategy would
be to sort agents according to their specialization, such
that gatherers of similar materials stay in the same team.
Afterwards, these groups can be deployed to different regions
where a speciﬁc resource is abundant. We can say that such
system shows a segregative behavior since the sorting process
leads dissimilar agents into distinct teams.
This work was partially supported by CAPES, CNPq and Fapemig. We
would like to thank Manish Kumar and Vijay Kumar for the discussions
regarding swarm segregation.

Segregation is a particular sorting mechanism that is
common in nature, being widely used by many individuals
such as cells and animals to shape these populations into
tissues as well as societies, respectively. This behavior has
been extensively studied by biologists, but few robotics
researchers have tried to simulate it on large swarm systems.
Therefore, we propose in this paper a controller that can
segregate a heterogeneous robotic swarm according to the
characteristics of each robot, such that similar robots form a
cohesive team, and dissimilar ones are separated from each
other. We base our approach on the differential potential
concept [2], an analogy for multi-agent systems of the
biological mechanisms by which cells segregate, extending
it to multiple groups. Furthermore, we employ LaSalle’s
Invariance Principle to demonstrate convergence and present
several simulated experiments in 2D and 3D spaces, which
validate the proposed controller.
This paper is organized as follows: Section II discusses re-
lated work on swarm control and segregation. In Section III,
we present our controller which is able to achieve segre-
gation in swarm systems. Experimental results in simulated
scenarios are detailed in Section IV, and Section V closes the
paper with our conclusions and directions for future work.
II. RELATED WORK
Reynolds [3] was one of the ﬁrst researchers to realistically
simulate the movement of a swarm of agents, more speciﬁ-
cally a ﬂock of birds, known as boids. His algorithm relies
on three simple steering rules that an agent applies based
on the information of its surrounding neighbors: separation,
which avoids collisions; alignment, which steers the agents
towards their average heading; and cohesion, which moves
the agents towards their average position. Such interactions
can be modeled as a special case of the social potential ﬁeld
method [4], an extension of the classical artiﬁcial potential
ﬁeld technique [5] that speciﬁcally deals with multi-agent
systems. These works have been widely employed as foun-
dations to several methodologies on the control of robotic
swarms, such as behavior-based [6], leader-follower [7], [8],
hierarchical abstractions [9], [10], hydrodynamic-based [11],
and others [12], [13].
Segregation is a natural phenomenon that appears in
several biological systems. For instance, ants sort their brood
in annular patterns in which distinct broods tend to be placed
at particular annuli [14]. Another example is cellular segre-
gation, which is of central importance in embryogenesis, as
the formation of many tissues require an initial subdivision of
cells into regions, each with speciﬁc characteristics that will
allow particular cell types to be generated [15]. Steinberg’s

Differential Adhesion Hypothesis [16] states that differences
in cell adhesion generate mechanical forces which drive
cellular segregation. In other words, a cell population expe-
rience stronger cohesive forces from similar cells than from
dissimilar ones, and this imbalance is responsible for the
segregative behavior [15].
Robotics researchers have mostly focused on segregation
as a mechanism by which robots sort a collection of objects
(e.g., see [17]), but some authors have speciﬁcally dealt
with segregation of heterogeneous agents. For example,
Groß [18] discussed a motor schema that allowed mobile
robots to self-organize into annular structures. A distributed
controller considers robots as having distinct virtual sizes,
and local interactions make “larger” robots move outwards.
This procedure was inspired by the Brazil Nut Effect, a
granular convection phenomenon by which a mixture of
granular material subjected to vibrations will lead its largest
particles to the surface. This work was later extended to
consider real e-puck robots [19]. In spite of the interest-
ing results, the controller requires all robots to share a
common target in order to simulate the gravitational forces
responsible for the granular convection. This implies that
a centralized broadcast or a consensus algorithm must be
executed previously. Based on Steinberg’s work [16], Kumar
et al. [2] proposed the differential potential concept, which
asserted that agents should experience different magnitudes
of potential while interacting with agents of distinct types
in order to achieve segregation. Stability analysis as well
as convergence proofs were presented. Nevertheless, their
approach is limited to only two types of robots, and the use
of multiple types easily leads the system to local minima
where segregation does not occur, a result which we have
seen in many experiments performed with their controller.
Finally, in a previous work [20], we maintained segregation
among multiple robot groups during navigation by using
velocity obstacles [21], but our method depends on teams
being already segregated at the initial time step.
In the present work, we are interested in developing proper
mechanisms that ensure segregation in the case of multiple
robot types. We tackle this problem by adapting and extend-
ing Kumar’s work [2] to deal with this scenario. Besides, we
also introduce a new metric in order to deﬁne segregation in
a more convenient way, which can be easily veriﬁed. Apart
from 2D simulations, we explore our controller’s behavior
in 3D spaces as well.
III. METHODOLOGY
We consider a set of fully actuated mobile agents whose
dynamics are given by the double integrator
˙ q

denote the position,

of mobile agents consists of different types of robots, which
we represent by the partition t =ft

j, i.e., each robot is
uniquely assigned to a single type and the type partition is
fully balanced, respectively.
Our objective is to synthesize a controller that can sort
robots of different types into m distinct clusters in the
workspace, such that each cluster contains agents of a single
type only. We refer to the latter as the segregation problem,
and a control system which solves this problem is said to
display a segregative behavior.
A. Control Law
Given a population of n heterogeneous mobile robots with
partition t and dynamics speciﬁed by (1), we propose the
following control law:

in whichU

Euclidean norm of the vector q

, andÑ
q

is the gradient
with respect to the coordinates of agent i. The ﬁrst term
represents the resultant force that acts on robot i given its
interactions with all other agents, whereas the second term
serves as damping and causes robots to match their velocities.
This kind of controller equation is a common approach for
potential-based swarm systems [2], [7], [12].
The artiﬁcial potential ﬁeldU

the relative distance between a pair of agents that we express
as

is a positive
parameter that will be described later. The initial conditions
and dynamics of the system exclude the situations where
kq

k= 0, in which (3) is undeﬁned. Furthermore, as we will
show later, if robots do not collide at the initial conﬁguration
then there will be no collisions through all time steps.
Although there are m distinct types of robots involved in
the system, each agent classiﬁes its neighbors as being either
of its own type or of a different type. This means that agents
see the system through a binary ﬁlter which reduces possible
robot interactions to only two kinds thereof: among robots of
the same type and among robots of distinct types. Formally,
we say that an agent i has a local type partition

In order to segregate robots, we apply the differential
potential concept, i.e., pairs of dissimilar agents experi-
ence different magnitudes of potential than pairs of similar
agents [2]. We can accomplish this by deﬁning the parameter

Equation (5) states that interactions among similar and

tively. Thus, the system exhibits a segregative behavior when

to see that, at any given distance, forces among agents of
similar types are greater than those among different types.
Therefore, our controller respects the differential potential
concept [2], and effectively implements an approximation of
Steinberg’s differential adhesion model [16].
B. Controller Analysis
In this section, we analyze the convergence of the multi-
agent system when using the proposed control law. We start
with the deﬁnition of the Lyapunov function
V(q;v)=U(q)+
1

|

where q2R
np
and v2R
np
are stacked vectors whose com-
ponents are the conﬁgurations and velocities of all robots,
respectively, andU(q) :R

is the collective artiﬁcial
potential function, which we write as

Thus, we can model the collective dynamics of the system:
˙ q= v (10)
˙ v= ÑU(q) 
ˆ
L(q)v; (11)
in which
ˆ
L(q) =L(q)
I
p
is the Kronecker product of the
system’s graph Laplacian L(q) and the pp identity matrix
I
p
(for a complete description, see [12]). These deﬁnitions
let us introduce the proposition below.
Proposition 1: Assuming that the underlying adjacency
graph of the system is complete at all times, for any
initial condition that belongs to the level set W
C
=f(q;v)j
V(q;v)Cg, with C> 0, a heterogeneous system with type
partition t on n mobile agents, whose dynamics and control
laws are respectively given by (1) and (2), asymptotically
converges to the largest invariant set in W

˙
V(q)= 0g, without any inter-agent collisions. At the largest
invariant set in W
I
, the velocity of each agent is bounded,
all velocities match, and the system’s collective potential
reaches a local minimum.
Proof: We aim to demonstrate that
˙
V(q;v) 0 in order
to apply LaSalle’s Invariance Principle to show convergence.
To achieve this, we can differentiate V(q;v) with respect to
time and then substitute (10) and (11) as follows:
˙
V(q;v)= ˙ q

ÑU(q)+ v

˙ v

 0: (12)
The last step holds because the system’s adjacency graph
is complete [12]. From LaSalle’s Invariance Principle, all
initial conditions that lie on W
C
will lead the system to the
largest invariant set inW
I
, where
˙
V(q;v)= 0. Therefore, (12)
implies that all velocities match, i.e.,8i; j : v

j
. By (8)
and (10), we have v

v 2C because V(q;v)C, which
leads tokvk
p
2C. Consequently, all velocities are bounded
1114
by
p
2C as well. Matching velocities imply that inter-agent
distances remain constant, hence8i; j : ˙ q

which implies that U(q) is constant at the steady state.
Moreover, as
ˆ
L(q)v = 0 because of matching velocities, we
can reduce (11) to
˙ v= ÑU(q): (14)
Therefore, ÑU(q) must be the zero vector, as otherwise the
collective potential would reach a lower value instead of
being constant. This implies that the system has reached a
local minimum and velocities must not change.
Finally, assume that robots i and j collide, i.e.,kq
ij
k= 0.
We can see from (3) and (9) that this would takeU(q)!¥,
but this contradicts the fact thatV(q;v)C. Hence, no agent
collides with each other.
C. Metric
In order to measure segregation among clusters quantita-
tively, we propose a metric that is based on the pairwise
intersection area of their convex hulls:
M(q;t)=
å
t
k
2t
å
t
l
2t;l6=k
A
 
CH(
[
i2t
k
q
i
)
\
CH(
[
j2t
l
q
j
)
!
; (15)
in which A(Q) and CH(Q) denote the area and the convex
hull of set Q, respectively. We have chosen this metric
because the convex hull can be used as a simple and well-
deﬁned shape representation of a cluster. This means that
segregation occurs when there is no overlap among clusters.
In other words, we say that the system is fully segregated
when M(q;t) approaches zero.
IV. EXPERIMENTS
We executed a sequence of simulations in order to study
the performance and feasibility of our proposed approach.
We ﬁrst present their results according to metric M(q;t) and
then display some snapshots of these experiments. Finally,
we close the section with a discussion on the behavior of the
system as well as on particular details of our method.
A. Simulations
We have performed an extensive series of simulations in
order to analyze our controller under metric M(q;t). Each
simulation consisted of 150 robots and a varying number
of agent types. At the initial state, all velocities were set
to zero, and robots were positioned according to a two-
dimensional uniform distribution, which is independent of
a robot’s type. Additionally, we have set d
AA
= 2 and d
AB
=
5 for all experiments. We present in Figure 2 the mean
and standard deviation of M(q;t) among 100 experiments
given these initial conditions. In all cases, both the mean
and standard deviation approach zero as the number of

iterations increase. Moreover, systems with less types tend to
achieve segregation faster than those with more types. This
is expected, as given a ﬁxed number of robots, the use of a
large number of types would result in few robots per cluster,
which in turn would lower the magnitude of the resultant
force towards it.
We display in Figure 3 a series of snapshots from particu-
lar instances of our experiments. Through a visual inspection,
we can see that similar robots quickly form clusters whose
size grows with time as other agents join them. Furthermore,
interesting geometrical patterns are organized at the stable
state. We have also observed two particular behaviors which
might be difﬁcult to notice in the ﬁgures
1
: large ensembles
usually move to the outside of the main aggregate, the
one that embodies all agents of the system, and adjacent
dissimilar clusters form corridors which are used by agents of
a third type to move at higher speeds. Both of these behaviors
are compelling because they contribute to the opening of free
spaces, whereby smaller clusters and lone robots can take
advantage of the situation and form larger ensembles.
We have executed simulations in 3D space as well. Figure
4 contains two images from the initial and ﬁnal conﬁgu-
rations of experiments comprising 150 robots and a varying
number of agent types. Initial conditions were chosen exactly
as in the 2D simulations. The controller was able to achieve
segregation, and robots have displayed the same overall
behavior as of their 2D counterparts. Particularly, we have
seen that it is easier for robots to form clusters in this
scenario because of the additional degree of freedom, which
allows agents to maneuver in new directions. Thus, in the 3D
case, it is unusual to ﬁnd lone robots wandering towards their
cluster in later iterations, since larger clusters are aggregated
more quickly.

B. Discussion
Equation (3) represents an important distinction between
our controller and Kumar’s prior work [2]. Regarding their
potential function, we noticed that its gradient may vanish
on the free space among adjacent dissimilar clusters. This
is the reason why our initial experiments, which used their
controller with multiple types, had often reached undesirable
local minima. Thus, by adding the quadratic term in (3), we
have actually increased the norm of the gradient and biased
its direction, which allowed robots to keep moving towards
their respective cluster.
Desirable properties in swarm systems include scalability,
ﬂexibility, and robustness [1]. These are specially important
on applications in which robots may be inserted or removed
from the system dynamically. One of the main advantages
of our approach is that a robot does not need to know either
how many agents or how many types exist in the system.
This is due to the second case of (5), in which we write
j62t
k
instead of j2¡nt
k
as the former explicitly states that
robot i needs to recognize only agents that are similar to
itself. Consequently, robots can be added or subtracted from
the system at any time.
As can be seen in (2), our controller requires global per-
ception capabilities, i.e., each robot must know the position
and velocity of all agents. Thus, in spite of the robustness of
our approach, this constraint may hinder its applicability on
physical systems, as real sensors usually have constrained
capabilities which restrict robots to gather local informa-
tion only. This is also a limitation of the method in [2].
Regarding our metric, there is a possible drawback in real

robotic systems. In case of robot failures, the metric could
give unsatisfactory results for an otherwise well-segregated
swarm, since the location of a single agent can have a large
impact on the metric.
Although we have constrained our approach to balanced
type partitions, we executed some simulations with un-
balanced partitions as well. In these experiments, robots
occasionally achieved segregation depending on the relative
balance of the partition, but several experiments reached local
minima when the type partition had been severely unbal-
anced. In these local minima, robots were not segregated
in the sense of our proposed metric. This usually happens
when robots cannot reach their cluster as the attractive forces
towards it are weaker than those repelling them away from
other agents. On the other hand, these types of local minima
in experiments with balanced type partitions are not common.
For example, among the 100 experiments with 15 types
presented in Figure 2, there was only one instance which
did not segregate. However, given the same initial conditions,
by choosing a larger value for d
AB
the controller was able
to achieve segregation. Thus, we think that this value should
be chosen according to how many robots and types exist
in the system, as larger numbers thereof may require wider
corridors between dissimilar clusters so that the gradient of
the potential function will not vanish.
Thus, we believe that, given a balanced type partition t,
and assuming that the underlying adjacency graph of the
system is complete at all times, for any initial condition that
belongs to the level setW
C
, there exists a ﬁnite value r such
that if
d
AB
d
AA
>r then M(q;t)! 0 as the number of iterations
approaches inﬁnity. Nevertheless, it is still necessary to
gather more evidence in order to formally prove this claim.
V. CONCLUSION
In this work, we proposed a controller that can sort a
system of multiple heterogeneous mobile robots into ho-
mogeneous clusters, such that agents of similar types are
segregated from dissimilar ones. We based our approach
on the differential potential concept, a conceptualization
of the mechanisms by which biological systems achieve
segregation. In this framework, agents experience distinct
magnitudes of potential when they interact with agents of
different types. We presented stability analyses and several
experiments in 2D and 3D scenarios, which demonstrated
the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
Despite the good results, we still see room for improve-
ment. For instance, our assumptions that robots have global
sensing capabilities may not hold in real scenarios, and
severely unbalanced type partitions may lead them to stable
states that are not segregated in the sense of our metric.
Regarding the former, we think it would be interesting to
explore control laws and possibly other potential functions
that model local sensing into their methodologies, whereas
the latter could be tackled by employing non-symmetrical
potential functions. All in all, both problems can be regarded
as a more general one, and we believe that, by further
studying these, our controller can be improved to solve the
segregation problem in a wider variety of instances.
