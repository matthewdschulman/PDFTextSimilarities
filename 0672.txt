Abstract— We present a method for setting the pressure of
multiple chambers using a single pressure source when they
are interconnected via band-pass valves. These valves can be
constructed from simple passive devices that behave like leaky
check valves. We present the theory of operation and design
parameters for individual valves, give a control strategy for
serial connections of pressure chambers, and demonstrate the
approach by building prototype valves and using them to
control serially connected soft-robotic actuators from a single
pressure source.
I. INTRODUCTION
A. Motivation
Developing novel soft robots that use pneumatic or hy-
draulic actuation to achieve complicated compliant motion
is currently an active area of research [1], [2], [3], [4]. Soft
robots can be very inexpensive to manufacture while being
robust to harsh chemical and physical environments that are
extremely challenging for existing robots [5]. The compliant
structure of soft robots also allows novel motion and grasping
strategies that are difﬁcult to implement with rigid parts.
Instead of motors and gears, these robots use integrated, dis-
tributed actuators to control their inﬁnite degrees of freedom.
One successful approach is to actuate pneumatic channels in
ﬂexible bodies with pressurized air [6].
Typically, these designs employ solenoid valves to control
the ﬂow of the working ﬂuid into and out of the actuators.
While solenoid valves are readily available and simple to
control, they have three principal drawbacks for ﬂow control
in soft robots: they are composed of rigid, electromagnetic
components; they are relatively expensive and are often the
most expensive component in systems with many actuators;
and their miniaturization is limited by the disadvantageous
scaling of electromagnetic forces at small scales [7].
We describe a simple passive valve design that behaves
like a leaky check valve and can be used to control the
pressures in a network of multiple connected chambers from
a single input. The simple mechanical design of these valves
could allow them to be integrated into current elastomeric
manufacturing techniques for soft robots and potentially
miniaturized for other applications. The central concept is
to exchange lower valve complexity for greater complexity
of the pressure source. Through deliberate modulation of
the system’s input pressure, the passive valves throughout
the system can be selectively opened and closed to ﬁll and
drain pressure chambers. For soft robots, this means that
logic and control can be baked into the mechanism itself.
For example, a soft-robotic tentacle with multiple chambers
(e.g. [8]) incorporating these types of valves could achieve
many poses using only a single external connection while at
the same time making the overall robot less expensive and
more mechanically robust.
The contribution of this paper is to present a device design
and associated control strategy for making this tradeoff.
The control strategy described in Sec. II is developed for
an idealized behavior of the valve. We present a particular
valve implementation for use with soft robots in Sec. III
and demonstrate the conﬁguration of multiple soft-robotic
actuators from a single pressure source Sec. IV.
B. Related Work
A majority of the previous work on pneumatically actuated
soft robotics has used off-board or on-board solenoid valves
to control the ﬂow of pressurized air to the actuators [8], [9],
[6], [5]. However, solenoid valves have the disadvantages
mentioned above of being difﬁcult to integrate, expensive,
and difﬁcult to miniaturize. Marchese et al. investigated the
use of electropermanent magnets to create energy-efﬁcient
valves for soft robots that only consume energy while switch-
ing between open and closed states [10]; However, aside
from their efﬁciency these valves have similar challenges as
solenoid valves, since they also employ electromagnets.
Related previous work has also used passive valves for
actuating robots. Nishioka et al. demonstrated passive valves
that can be activated by acoustic waves through the working
ﬂuid [11]. However, while passive, their valves require
resonant mechanical structures that may be difﬁcult to inte-
grate into current manufacturing techniques for soft robots.
Shepherd et al. used passive soft valves molded into the
body of soft robots that used internal explosions for rapid
actuation [12]. Similar to the valves presented here, these
passive valves remained open at low pressures differentials
(to allow the venting of combustion products) but closed
during the rapid pressure increase caused by the explosions.
However, these valves were not designed or characterized
to achieve hold states or to be individually addressable, and
off-board solenoid valves and spark ignition electronics were
required to control actuation.
Small-scale soft valves are also an active area of research
in microﬂuidics[13], where they are used for the control of
ﬂuid ﬂow on chips through channels with dimensions of tens
of micrometers. A common approach in microﬂuidics is the
use of a secondary pressurized pneumatic layer to valve a
primary ﬂuidic layer [14]. While this approach signiﬁcantly
reduces the complexity of the microﬂuidic chips, each in-
dependently addressable pneumatic valve is still controlled
off-board by a solenoid valve, effectively maintaining the
cost and complexity of the overall system. Recent work has
sought to remedy this problem by developing latching valves
to achieve on-board digital control logic for multiplexing

valves [15], [16], [17]. However, devices of this sort have
not been demonstrated that can achieve the pressures and
ﬂow rates required to valve soft robots.
II. VALVE DESIGN AND THEORY OF OPERATION
The idea is to design a passive valve that allows pressur-
izing several chambers to different levels, i.e. pressure con-
ﬁgurations, using a single modulated pressure source. The
particular approach described here is a valve that behaves like
a leaky check valve that always allows ﬂow in the forward
direction, but only allows a certain amount of backward ﬂow
before closing. Physically, this can be implemented by a
introducing a small gap in a regular check valve design.
Connecting two of these valves in series creates a band-pass
valve that only allows low ﬂow rates. When these band-pass
valves are used to connect several pressure chambers, a single
modulated pressure source can be used to reach arbitrary
pressure conﬁgurations by selectively closing some valves
while feeding pressure chambers through the open ones.
A. Device Model and Control Strategy
This section describes the idealized behavior of a leaky
check valve where the maximum leaking rate can be care-
fully controlled. The symbol to represent the device and
the desired operational behavior are shown in Fig. 1(a) and
Fig. 1(b). The forward ﬂow through the valve is proportional
to the pressure difference across the device. In the backward
direction, the ﬂow through the valve is also proportional
to the pressure difference up to a critical value called the
shutoff pressure, ?P
shutoff
, beyond which the valve closes
and prevents ﬂow. Thus, the volumetric ﬂow through the
device,
˙
V , is related to the pressure differential across the
device ?P , and ﬂow resistance R in the following way:

V =

The maximal leaking rate is given by

Using a single such valve connected to the input of a pressure
chamber allows the chamber to be both inﬂated and deﬂated
using a single pressure source. Just like a regular check
valve, the chamber can be inﬂated and the pressure source
removed. However, unlike a regular check valve the same
pressure source can be used to deﬂate the pressure chamber
by keeping the pressure source below, but within ?P
shutoff
,
of the chamber pressure.
Two of these devices can be connected into a band-
pass valve conﬁguration shown Fig. 1(c). Each individual
valve can stop ﬂow through both of them, and since they
face in opposite directions, this combined device now has a
shutoff pressure in both directions, Fig. 1(d). The result is
a device that allows low ﬂow in both directions, but shuts
off at high ﬂows in either direction. Although there is no
such restriction in practice, the following discussion assumes
that the shutoff pressures are symmetric for simplicity. The
idealized behavior of this band-pass valve is characterized
by the pressure and ﬂow pass-band, which are given by
?P

When this band-pass valve is used to connect two pressure

B. Control Strategy
The space of pressure conﬁgurations forN pressure cham-
bers is P

, the N-fold cross product of the non-
negative real numbers. In this section we describe a strategy
for reaching all stable conﬁgurations when the pressure
chambers are arranged in series and connected via N? 1
band-pass valves with decreasingly nested ﬂow pass-bands,
and a modulated pressure source, P
in
, is connected to the
ﬁrst chamber with pressure P

sufﬁciently large margin so valve i can be closed without
closing any of the valves j < i. The required amount of
separation depends the actuation ﬁdelity of the source, the
precision of valve characteristics, and on the nature of the
pressure chambers: large and expandable chambers require
more separation, see Sec. II-B.1 for details.
The control strategy has two steps, ﬁrst a strategy to reach
an arbitrary stable conﬁguration when initially none of the
valves are closed, and second, a strategy for going from an
arbitrary conﬁguration to one where all the pressures in all
chambers are equal and all valves are open.

The edges are labeled where the overhead arrow indicates the direction. Each transitions changes the least signiﬁcant bit (LSB, left) and wether a transition
corresponds to pressurizing or depressurizing chambers depends on wether the LSB changes from 0 to 1 (pressurizing) or from 1 to 0 (depressurizing).
The strategy for reaching a particular stable target conﬁgu-
rationP
?
? P
N
is to iteratively pressurize chambers, starting
with P
N
, i.e. the chamber that is furthest from the pressure
source. The pressure is modulated to slowly pressurize all
chambers to the target pressureP
?
N
of the last chamber. Then,
depending on whetherP
?
N?1
is larger or smaller thanP
?
N
, the
modulated pressure source increases (or decreases) quickly
enough to close the last band-pass valve between chambers
N?1 andN and to pressurize the ﬁrstN?1 chambers to the
target pressure P
?
N?1
. When the target pressure is reached,
the pressure is changed quickly enough to close the valve
between chambersN?2 andN?1, and to adjust the pressure
of the ﬁrst N? 2 chambers to P
?
N?2
, etc. These serially
connected chambers act like a shift register for pressures.
Given an arbitrary stable pressure conﬁguration, reaching
a state where all valves are open can be achieved by reversing
the above process. First P
1
is adjusted to P
2
±?P
1
shutoff
and
the two chambers are allowed to equilibrate. Then the ﬁrst
two chambers are brought to the level of P
3
±?P
2
shutoff
and
allowed to equilibrate, etc. until all the chambers are at the
same pressure and none of the valves are closed. Finally, the
pressure of all chambers can be adjusted simultaneously to
some desired level, e.g. ambient pressure.
1) Separation of Pass-Bands: In this serial conﬁguration,
the ﬂow coming out of a valve splits into ﬂow that ﬁlls the
pressure chamber and ﬂow that goes into the downstream
valve. To describe how the ﬂow splits we deﬁne the ﬁll
resistanceR
i
ﬁll
of chamberi to be the resistance to volumetric
ﬂow for changing the chamber pressure. By ignoring any
ﬂow resistance from the input port, differentiating the ideal
gas law (P

the ﬁll resistance is found to be

A chamber that has either a large volume V
i
or that expands
easily, i.e.
∂Vi

is large, has a low resistance to volumetric
ﬂow that is diverted to change the pressure inside the cham-
ber. Assuming equal pressures in chamber i and upstream
chambers, the ﬂow

coming into chamber i splits so
that the ﬂow

If the ﬁll resistance is large ,then the ﬂows in and out of the
chamber are approximately equal. When the ﬁll resistance
is low, as is the case in soft robots with large expandable
chambers, then the pass-bands in the series connection need
to be separated by

This restriction allows the i-th valve to be closed without

This representation highlights the fact that it is good for
upstream valves to have a low ﬂow resistance compared
to downstream valves. By allowing more ﬂow at similar
pressures, both chamber i and upstream chambers can be
ﬁlled without closing downstream valves.
2) Example for a Series of Binary Actuators: Consider a
series of three binary actuators that are either at ambient
pressure (0) or inﬂated (1), see Fig. 2. There are 2
3
=
8 different states, and since there are only two different
pressure levels, there are shortcuts to move between the 8
target pressures. States where chambers far from the source
remain unchanged can be reached without going back to the
starting conﬁguration (000), see Fig. 2(c).
Since this example has N = 3 chambers it requires N?
1 = 2 distinctly addressable band-pass valves, Fig. 2(b). In
terms of pressure modulation, two such valves require three
different pressure settings that result in three different ﬂow
speeds through the system: slow where none of the valves
close, medium where only the sensitive valves furthest from
the pressure source close, and fast where both valves close.
Figure 2(c) shows the transition diagram where the three
different transitions are labeled. For example, starting from
state 000 the three different pressurization speeds result in
three different states: 100, 110, or 111.
Note that the separation requirement is between ﬂows
of two neighboring band-pass valves and not between the
shutoff ﬂows in the two directions of a single band-pass
valve. In our physical experiments, Sec. IV, we relax the
symmetry assumption to get better separation between actu-
ation pressures in the physical device. However, the above
strategy still applies directly.

III. VALVE DESIGN
The device described in this section is a prototype design
for demonstrating how pressure conﬁgurations in a multi-
chamber system can be set by modulating the pressure
proﬁle from a single source, see Sec. IV. The valve has
no active components and the internal parts that determine
the operational characteristics can be easily swapped to
facilitate exploration of the parameter space. We were able to
ﬁnd enough combinations to implement two independently
addressable band-pass valves (and a ﬁfth valve that allows
us to disconnect the pressure source), see Fig. 2. We kept
the internal geometry relatively simple to facilitate the future
development of completely soft and/or miniaturized versions.
A. Physical Design
Our leaky check valve consists of three main functional
features contained in a 3D-printed housing: an acrylic oriﬁce
plate, a plastic separator to induce leaking, and a rubber ﬂap.
There are three operating regimes. In the forward direction,
ﬂow deforms the rubber ﬂap, but there are no features for
it to seal against. In the backward direction, under low ﬂow
conditions, the deﬂection of the rubber ﬂap is not sufﬁcient to
cause it to seal against the oriﬁce plate. However, under high
ﬂow conditions, the rubber ﬂap deforms and seals against the
oriﬁce plate. Once the ﬂow is shut off, differential pressure
across the valve maintains the seal, see Fig. 3(a). The three
internal components of a valve are shown in Fig. 3(b).
The 3D-printed housing has two halves that are attached
with screws so that the internal components can be quickly
and easily exchanged. Grooves in the valve body hold two
O-rings: one underneath the oriﬁce plate to prevent air from
leaking past the valve and another sealing the two halves of
the housing, see Fig. 3(c). The oriﬁce plate, spacer, and valve
ﬂap are laser cut from their respective stock materials: 3 mm
acrylic, 0.13 mm (5 mil) PET ﬁlm, and natural latex rubber
sheets, durometer 40A, of various thicknesses. The outer
diameter of these parts is, 14.5 mm, and the inner diameter
for the spacer and ﬂap are 7.5 mm and 9.5 mm respectively.
The width of the ﬂap is 5.5 mm, see Fig. 3(b).
B. Device Characterization
We characterized the shutoff pressure for various pa-
rameter combinations by connecting the device to a hand
operated syringe pump while recording pressure proﬁles,
see Fig. 4. During the test the syringe was connected to
the output port of the valve, so that the syringe could be
freely ﬁlled. Pushing air back out, we moved the plunger
at a steadily increasing speed until the pressure reached
several psi. The increasing ﬂow rate increases the pressure
across the valve, see Fig. 1(b). When the pressure is below
?P
shutoff
, air is vented through the input port. However,
once the shutoff pressure is reached, the venting stops and
the plunger movement causes compression and a rapid rise
in the measured pressure. For each valve combination we
repeated this process multiple times to assess repeatability of
a particular valve and to get better estimates of the shutoff
pressure.
The table in Fig. 5 shows some of the working parameter
combinations and the measured shutoff values. As one would
expect, thicker (and as a result stiffer) valve ﬂaps resulted
in higher shutoff pressures. The values in each row increase

ﬂow does not cause sufﬁcient deformation in the valve ﬂap to create a
seal. High backward ﬂow seals the valve ﬂap against the oriﬁce plate. The
locations of the two internal O-rings are sown in gray. (b) Three different

monotonically. The relation of the shutoff pressure to the
oriﬁce size is more complicated as several factors seem to
compete at these size and pressure scales. On the one hand, a
larger oriﬁce size decreases the ﬂow resistance, R, allowing
more ﬂow at a given pressure. Since moving air has to change
momentum to ﬂow around the valve ﬂap, the increased ﬂow
should result in a greater deﬂection and thus a lower shut off
pressure. On the other hand, larger holes are more difﬁcult
to seal and we suspect that the low shutoff pressures for the
1.5 mm oriﬁces are due to the fact that the smaller holes were
easier to close.
There are many opportunities for further characterizing
and optimizing of this type of valve. However, an exhaustive
design optimization is beyond the scope of this work. Since
the goal here is the demonstration of a novel actuation
strategy, we focused on identifying a set of valves with sufﬁ-
ciently different shutoff pressures to perform the experiments
outlined in the next section.
In addition to the data using 0.13 mm (6 mil) spacers, pre-
sented in Fig. 5, we also tested conﬁgurations with 0.05 mm
(2 mil) spacers and 0.25 mm (10 mil) spacers. For the thinner
spacer, some conﬁgurations acted like a regular check valves
and closed immediately (?P
shutoff
= 0). For the thicker
spacer, some conﬁgurations never closed with the pressure
differentials we were able to generate (?P
shutoff
>≈ 5psi).
IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
By using several of the valves described in the previous
section, we were able to create band-pass valves and reach

derivative (blue circles). Each valve was repeatedly closed to get an estimate

robotic actuators that act as pressure chambers, see Fig. 6.
The valves that connect them are completely passive, and the
only controlled input is a hand-operated syringe pump.
Asymmetric pass-bands resulted in good shutoff pressure
separation in both the pressurizing and depressurizing di-
rection. The smaller oriﬁces in the second band-pass valve
compared to the ﬁrst also resulted in better pass-band separa-
tion according to Eqn. (5). The separation was large enough
to allow reliable manual operation.
We performed a depth-ﬁrst traversal of the conﬁguration
tree shown in Fig. 2 starting in conﬁguration 000 and explor-
ing the branches top to bottom. Figure 7 shows the measured
pressures of all three actuators and the input pressure as a

sufﬁcient to reach all eight conﬁgurations. The 15 states that
had to be visited for a complete traversal are highlighted

the picture. The thin white pressure lines that fork off the actuator supply
lines are connected to digital pressure sensors. The white boxes show the
parameters of the valve below: direction, shutoff pressure, oriﬁce diameters,
spacer thickness, and ﬂap thickness.
Low shutoff pressures and ﬂows limit the actuation speed,
and the number of chambers is limited by the required sep-
aration between the shutoff pressures/ﬂows. The separation
must obey the restrictions given in Eqn. (4) and (5) and
additionally account for limits on the modulation accuracy
of the pressure source. Thus overall system performance can
be improved by designing better pressure sources with ﬁner
pressure control, improving valve manufacturing with more
precise shutoff pressures, and employing higher operating
pressures that can accommodate more pass-bands.
We focused on binary pressure combinations, but inter-
mediate pressure levels should be equally easy to achieve
with a similar strategy. Also, we focused on a simple serial
connection, but for some robotic or microﬂuidic applications
parallel arrangements could be advantageous. The presented
band-pass valve design control strategy could easily be
adapted to such new scenarios.
V. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
We presented an idealized valve model and a control
strategy that allows ﬁlling multiple connected chambers to
different pressure levels. The operational theory of this valve
is to deliberately introduce a gap to allow backward ﬂow
into a check valve design. Connecting two of these valves
in series results in a band-pass valve, which can be used to
selectively gate different chambers from being ﬁlled/drained.
The simple design should allow this type of valve to be
implemented with different materials and at different length
scales. We demonstrate the approach with serially connected
soft-robotic actuators and a prototype valve design on a cm-
scale. The main limitation of our approach is that ﬁlling
pressures need to be controlled more accurately than ﬁlling
single pressure chambers, and that it introduces dependencies
between state variables: at a given time possible ﬁlling rates
for a given chamber depend both on the connection topology
of chambers and their pressure states.
For both soft-robotic and microﬂuidic applications, the im-
mediate next step is to design valves that can be incorporated
in the existing manufacturing processes. Since the key func-
tional component is a ﬂexible ﬂap with carefully controlled

thickness and spacing, we expect that incorporating it into
soft lithography (microﬂuidics) and casting (soft robots) is
possible. This would allow producing less expensive robots
with fewer complex components and microﬂuidic chips with
fewer external pressure lines.
By more carefully modeling and characterizing these
band-pass valves we expect much more aggressive control
strategies to be possible. The models presented here are
idealized linear versions, and we ignore pressure losses along
connecting lines. Especially in microﬂuidic applications
where the chamber volumes are small and the routing lines
comparatively long, creating more complete models would
likely improve the reliability of operating many addressable
pressure chambers from a single supply line. Similarly, we
chose a serial network topology because it results in a simple
control strategy, but parallel connections or mixtures of the
two are possible and might simplify actuation for speciﬁc
applications or provide robustness to device failures.
