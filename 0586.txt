Abstract— This paper covers the energy-saving features of a 
robotics system by redundant actuation. By installing more 
actuators than the degrees of freedom, the actuating torques can 
be distributed. This distribution can reduce the overall energy loss, 
which reduces the overall energy consumption. An experiment was 
conducted with a 2-DOF general manipulator and redundant 
actuated manipulator; these were made to follow a typical welding 
pathway used in an automotive factory. The results showed that 
the redundant manipulator saved up to 38% electrical energy for 
actuation compared to the general manipulator. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
High-efficiency robotic systems can be achieved by 
reducing energy loss. When a robotic system is in operation, it 
requires electrical energy for input. This input energy is not 
only used for output energy but also consumed owing to 
energy loss. Therefore, reducing energy loss can improve the 
efficiency of a system. 
Various studies have examined reducing energy loss. The 
previous researches were usually focused on trajectory 
planning; they attempted to optimize trajectories by measuring 
the performance in terms of effort and energy. Halevi et al. 
researched an optimal trajectory for minimum energy control 
of machine tool [1]. Field et al. researched an iterative 
dynamic programming for the optimal trajectory generation of 
robotic manipulator [2]. Bobrow et al. researched an optimal 
robot motions for physical criteria [3]. Moreover, there have 
been previous researches using gravity compensation devices 
such as counter weights and counter springs [4-7]. 
In this study, a new energy-saving feature is presented that 
the energy loss of robot manipulator can be reduced by 
redundant actuation. Redundant actuation can distribute the 
required torque for actuation, and the required current is 
proportional to torque. Because the energy loss is mainly 
proportional to the square of the current, this distribution of 
torque reduces the energy loss. Moreover, this suggested 
method can be applied with other methods counter balances 
and gravity compensation springs. To the best of our 
knowledge, no previous work has covered on this saving 
energy by redundant actuation.

The energy saving theory by redundant actuation is 
verified with simulations and experiments. A 2-DoF test 
manipulator which are modified from a base mechanism of 
general welding robots is used for the verification. A 
non-redundant mechanism and a redundantly actuated one are 
being operated with the same test pathway for verifying 
energy saving feature of redundant actuation. A simulation 
comparison about an energy consumption of those two 
manipulators is presented. Moreover, experimental results 
measuring electrical energy that the test manipulators 
consume is also depicted. 
This paper is organized as follows. The energy-saving 
theory of redundant actuation is presented in Section 2. A 
dynamic and power consumption of a 2-DOF test manipulator 
is presented in Section 3. In Section 4, the simulation results 
about saving energy by redundant actuation are presented. The 
experimental verification with a test pathway is depicted in 
Section 5. Finally, concluding remarks follow in Section 6. 
II. CONCEPT 
The input energy for actuating a robotic system is not only 
used for output work but also consumed as energy loss. There 
are many reasons for energy loss, but the main factor is coil 
loss in the motor. This loss is dissipated as heat in the motor 
and is proportional to the square of the current. 
Fig.1 shows the basic concept of reducing energy loss by 
adding more motors. In the figure, the actuators are holding a 
10 kg weight box as stop state. By adding more actuation, the 
required force in Fig.1(a) is distributed as shown in Fig.1(b).  
In general, the required motor current is proportional to the 
Energy savings of a 2-DOF manipulator with redundant actuation

required torque. This means that distributing the force also 
distributes the required motor current. This feature can reduce 
the total energy loss because each motor coil loss is 
proportional to each square of the required current. In this 
concept, minimizing the sum of square forces can reduce the 
energy loss. Therefore, minimizing the sum of the square 
forces is the main objective function to reduce the energy loss. 
This energy reduction concept can be applied even more 
efficient to robot manipulator systems. In Fig.2, a 2-DOF 
manipulator are holding 10 kg weight box as a stop state. By 
adding more motors, a 2-DOF general manipulator can be 
extended into a redundantly actuated manipulator as shown in 
Fig.2(b). This redundant manipulator can distribute the overall 
required torque of the general manipulator. Optimal 
distribution of the torques can minimize the sum of the square 
of actuation torques and reduce the energy loss over 50%.  
III. MODEL 
A.  Dynamics model 
A 2-DOF test manipulator based on a conventional 
manipulator IRB1410 by ABB is used for verification tests. 
Fig.3(a) shows a schematic diagram of the general 
manipulator. The main link (l 4) is connected to two linkage 
structures: (l 1, l 2) and (l 3). Two actuators were installed: B 1 and 
B 2. 
As shown in Fig.3(b), the 2-DOF test manipulator was 
modified into a redundant manipulator. An additional linkage 
structure (l 5, l 6) and one motor B 3 were added. The dimension 
of this linkage structure is selected by referring to origin 
linkage structures, and will be optimized in future work. 
As a result, the redundant manipulator comprises a main link 
(l 4) and three connecting linkage structures: (l 1, l 2), (l 3), and (l 5, 
l 6). This mechanism is still 2-DOF but is operated by three 
actuators: B 1, B 2, and B 3. Table I presents details on the lengths 
and weights of the linkages of the redundant manipulator. 
The equations of motion for the proposed 2-DOF test 
manipulator in Fig.3 can be derived from the constraint 
equation, which represents the geometric constraint of the 
mechanism during its operation. The constraint equation can 
be expressed as follows:

J J represents the length between joints J j and J k. 
The velocity relationships can be calculated using the 
constraint Jacobian relationship [8, 9]. This relationship can 
be obtained by the time derivative of the geometric constraint 
equation ) g(? . By collecting the actuating joints from the 
independent joints q u and some of the dependent joints with 
actuators q v, we can derive the relationship between the 
velocities of the independent and actuating joint angles as 
follows:

where q u and q r are the independent and actuating joint vectors, 
respectively. U is a transfer matrix from the independent and 
dependent joint vector to all of the joint vector. V is the 
selection matrix of the actuating joints from all of the joint 
vectors. ? is a Jacobian mapping from the independent joints 
to the dependent joints. ? is a Jacobian mapping from the 
independent joints to all of the actuating joints.  
From (2), we can derive a relationship between torque 
vectors of the actuator in the general and redundant case as 
follows.

where ? u is a torque vector of the actuators in the general case 
and ? r is a torque vector of the actuators in the redundant case. 
Because the number of active joints is greater than that of the 
independent joints in the case of the redundant manipulator, 
the actuation torque vector of redundant manipulator has 
non-unique solution. 
The torques of the redundant actuation can be expressed 
by (4) for a minimum-norm torque distribution that minimizes 
the sum of square torques [10].

B.  Power consumption model 
For simulation of the 2-DOF test manipulator, a power 
consumption model is analyzed. The power model consists of 
output power and power loss. 
The output power means the power that actually performs 
an action in the motor. In case of positive output power, the 
motor uses input power for actuation. However, in case of 
negative output power value the power dissipates as heat since 
the motor usually cannot regenerate that power but lose the 
energy. Thus, the output power can be calculated as the sum of 
the product of torques and angular velocities of the actuating 
joints only if those product value has positive value, as shown 
in (6):

i
q? is the angular velocity 
of the i-th actuating joint B i. [x]
+
 means that if x is larger than 
zero, [x] is x, otherwise [x] is zero. 
The power loss of the test manipulator occurs in motors 
and amplifiers. The coil loss is the main contributor to the 
motor loss. This is heat loss caused by the flow of current [11]. 
The equation is given below: 
2
?
coil
P RI                                (7) 
where R is the coil resistance and I is the motor current. 
There are two types of power loss in the motor amplifier: 
conduction loss and switching loss [12, 13]. Each power loss 
occurs when current flows in an insulated gate bipolar mode 
transistor (IGBT) of the amplifier. The equation for 
conduction loss is as follows: 
2
??
cond TA TA
P c I d I                              (8) 
where c TA and d TA are constants for the conduction loss. The 
switching loss is given by the following equation: 
?
swit IGBT
P k I                              (9) 
where k IGBT is a constant for the switching loss. 
Thus, the power consumption model is summation of the 
output power, coil loss, conduction loss and switching loss. 
Because the current is proportional to the torque, the power 
consumption model can be expressed as (10):

To estimate the power model of the 2-DOF test 
manipulator, we measured the power consumption using the 
lookup table method. The power consumption was measured 
with power meter (CW121, YOKOGAWA) at the power 
source of actuation parts including the motors and amplifiers. 
Because the 2-DOF test manipulator has two types of 
actuation parts, each part was measured. 
Because the output power can be calculated by (6), we 
only needed to measure the power loss. Therefore, the 
experiment was performed while keeping the motor in the stop 
position, which means that the output power was zero. We 
measured the consumption power according to the torque by 
changing the actuator load at 21 points.  
Fig.4 shows the measurement results. The measurements 
were performed for each actuation part in the 3.0 kWh class 
(motor: SGMGH30A2A2C, amplifier: SGDH30AE by 
Yaskawa) and 4.4 kWh class (motor: SGMGH44A2A2C, 
amplifier: SGDH44AE by Yaskawa). The red line with 
triangles shows the 3.0 kWh estimation model. The blue line 
marked with circles shows the 4.4 kWh estimation model. 
Each marker shows a measurement point of the experiment.

IV. SIMULATION 
A. Test condition 
The test pathway is shown in Fig.5, and it starts at position 
1 and ends at position 7. This test pathway is used in the spot 
welding process at an automotive industry. The overall time of 
the test pathway is 78 seconds, and the maximum velocity of 
the end-effector was set to 290 mm/sec. The general and 
redundant manipulators were operated over the same test 
pathway with a 10 kg payload. 
B. Distribution of actuation torques 
The general manipulator had a unique solution of actuation 
torques during operation. However, the redundant 
manipulator can distribute the actuation torque of the electric 
motors, because it has non-unique solution. Therefore, we 
should determine how to distribute the actuation torques to 
reduce the power consumption. 
The power consumption of actuators is mainly 
proportional to summation of the square values of each motor 
current. This means that the energy consumption can be 
reduced by minimizing the sum of the squares of each 
actuation torque. Therefore, the minimum-norm torque 
distribution is selected. 
The objective of the minimum-norm torque distribution is 
to minimize the sum of squares of each redundant torque. The 
minimizing process was executed for the overall operation 
time. The performance index for the minimizing process of 
each time is shown in (11).

power consumption of the general manipulator over the test 
pathway, where only two actuators at B 1 and B 2 were assumed 
to be in operation. The blue dashed line represents the power 
consumption of the redundant manipulator with 
minimum-norm distribution. The redundant manipulator used 
an additional linkage set and three actuators at B 1, B 2, and B 3 
Fig.7(b) depicts the power saved by the redundant 
manipulator. The general manipulator was expected to 
consume 19,041 J of energy according to the simulation result.  
The redundant manipulator was expected to save 7983 J 
energy. The energy was calculated by integrating the power 
consumption during manipulation. The simulation results 
showed that the energy consumption by the redundant 
actuation was 41.9% less than that of the general actuation 
V. EXPERIMENT 
To verify the simulation results, experiments were carried 
out with the 2-DOF test manipulator depicted in Fig.8. The 
test manipulators were controlled by a Turbo-UMAC 
controller (DeltaTau). Fig.9 shows the comparison between 
simulation and experimental results of the actuation torques. 
The torques of actuators were measured from the electric 
source. The solid line represents experimental result, and the 
dashed line represents simulation result. The red line 
represents the actuation torque of B 1, the blue line represents 
the actuation torque of B 2, and the green line represents the 
actuation torque of B 3. 
The total power consumption was measured with a power 
meter (CW121, YOKOGAWA) at the power source for all of 
the actuation parts. The power consumption included the 
power of all the motors and amplifiers. 
The experiments were carried out for the general and 
redundant manipulators. Every experiment was performed for 
a test pathway with a 10 kg payload, where the maximum 
velocity of the end-effector was set to 290 mm/s. The 
redundant manipulator was operated with minimum-norm 
torque distribution control. In the minimum-norm torque 
distribution control, the actuators in the redundant manipulator 
can be controlled using independent control scheme for each 
actuator. That is, each actuator can be controlled using only 
the information from the corresponding encoder, rather than 
information from the encoders in the other actuators [10]. 
Fig.10 compares the simulation and experimental results 
for the power consumption of the general and redundant 
manipulators. The dashed line represents the simulation 
results, and the solid line represents the experimental results. 
The red line represents the energy consumption by general 
actuation, and the blue line represents the energy consumption 
by redundant actuation. The green line represents the energy 
saved by redundant actuation. 
The experimental results were similar to the simulation 
results. The former showed that the energy consumed by the 
redundant manipulator was 38.0% less than that of the general 
manipulator. The saved energy was 7986 J. Table II compares 
the experiment and simulation results for the energy 
consumption in both cases.

distribution can distribute the required current of the actuating 
motor, which can reduce the energy loss of the overall 
actuation system. A 2-DOF test manipulator was made to 
follow a welding test pathway in an experiment and operated 
using a minimum-norm torque distribution. 
 Both the simulated and experimental results showed that 
that the redundant manipulator reduced the energy 
consumption compared to the general manipulator. The 
experimental result showed that the redundant manipulator 
saved up to 38.0% of the energy along the test pathway. This 
result shows the novel advantage of the redundant mechanism 
from an energy perspective. This energy-saving feature is 
effective in robotics systems that are greatly affected by 
gravitational forces. As a future work, the workspace will be 
tested. Pathways will be analyzed to clarify the energy saving 
feature with respect to the workspace, and the workspace 
change for kinematic chains modified will be analyzed too.
