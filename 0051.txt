Abstract— The trajectories of mobile seeds have a great
inﬂuence on localization accuracy and efﬁciency. This paper
presents a novel information-driven intelligent mobility-assisted
wireless sensor network localization algorithm. Without re-
quiring any prior knowledge of the sensing ﬁeld, seeds’ or
pseudo-seeds’ (common sensors which have been positioned)
trajectories are scheduled dynamically aiming at position esti-
mates of neighboring non-positioned common sensors. With an
information-theoretic utility measure as the objective function,
mobile seeds or pseudo-seeds actively determine their motion
directions for minimizing the uncertainty in position estimates
of neighboring sensors. At the ﬁrst level, seeds estimate the
neighboring sensor nodes’ positions with bearing measurements
by means of extended Kalman ﬁlters and optimize their motion
directions by maximizing the mutual information between the
position estimates and the motions of seeds. Afterwards the
seeds forward the position estimates to the corresponding
sensor nodes, which then act as pseudo-seeds. By repeating
this process at the following levels, all sensor nodes can
obtain position estimates. Compared with heuristic mobility and
random mobility-assisted mobile sensor network localization
algorithms, the proposed algorithm requires fewer maneuvers
of seed or pseudo-seeds for quick convergence to good position
estimates. Extensive simulations show that this algorithm can
provide more accurate position estimates with fewer maneuvers,
especially in the case of limited seeds.
I. INTRODUCTION
For information seeking, sensor networks have obvious
advantages, such as complementary heterogeneous sensing,
inherent robustness, greater coverage and relatively lower
cost.
Data collected by sensors are useful only with labeling
the location information. Although low-cost GPS can be
commercially available, it cannot work indoors or in the
presence of obstacles that limit line-of-sight to the satellites.
GPS signals may be jammed and unavailable in some hostile
scenarios such as battleﬁeld surveillance. Numerous local-
ization techniques have been proposed for wireless sensor
networks [1].
Mobile seeds have been used for wireless sensor network
localization to decrease the cost for seeds [2]. Mobility has
been exploited by Monte Carlo Localization (MCL) which
is specially proposed for mobile sensor network [3], [4].
Random motion of nodes is typically assumed.

sensor network localization algorithm
Actually, mobile sensor nodes have controllable mobility
in many application scenarios. By means of controllable
mobility [5], mobile sensor networks are expected to perform
active sensing or active perception.
Controllable mobility of mobile seeds has been researched
for localization. In [6], mobile beacons’ paths are set for in-
creasing localization accuracy with the known sensing ﬁeld.
Dynamic mobility scheduling without any prior knowledge
of the sensing ﬁeld boundary has been started from scratch.
Some heuristic movement strategies have been designed.
In [7], a mobile beacon is guided close to a certain un-
known sensor by depth-ﬁrst traversal (DFT) of the network
graph, or, to the unknown neighboring sensor with most
neighbors [8], [9]. These dynamic path planning algorithms
only consider coverage of mobile beacons without taking
localization accuracy into account.
In this paper, a novel information-driven mobility schedul-
ing algorithm for mobile sensor network localization is pre-
sented. Trajectories of seeds or pseudo-seeds (common sen-
sors which have been positioned) are dynamically scheduled
aiming at position estimates of neighboring non-positioned
sensors. With an information-theoretic utility measure as
the objective function, mobile seeds determine their next
motion directions for minimizing uncertainty in position
estimates of their neighboring nodes obtained with extended
Kalman ﬁlters. With this controllable mobility, localization
accuracy can be dramatically improved even with only a very
limited number of seeds. Extensive simulations demonstrate
efﬁciency of the proposed information-driven hierarchical
localization algorithm.

II. INTELLIGENT MOBILITY ASSISTED MOBILE SENSOR
NETWORK LOCALIZATION ALGORITHM
A. System environment and assumptions
Our research is motivated by the following scenario. In
search-and-rescue in urban ruins, where only a few sensor
nodes can acquire GPS signals or be manually conﬁgured
with geographic locations. Initially, all sensor nodes and
seeds are randomly scattered. All sensor nodes have data
processing, storage and communication capabilities. They
can acquire the bearing measurements with their neighbors
within a certain range and are mounted with actuators. It is
preferred that mobile sensor networks localize themselves as
soon as possible before executing sensing tasks so as much
as possible energy could be conserved for the next sensing
tasks. The common sensor nodes which need to be positioned
stay at rest.
B. Framework of the information-driven hierarchical local-
ization algorithm
The proposed information-driven hierarchical localization
algorithm is depicted in Figure 1.
At the beginning, seeds estimate the neighboring sensor
nodes’ positions with bearing measurements by means of ex-
tended Kalman ﬁlters, they optimize their motion directions
by maximizing the mutual information between the bearing
measurements and the position estimates. With the bearing
measurements obtained by the active movements, the posi-
tions of the common sensor nodes can be estimated quickly
by the seed’s ﬁlter. As soon as the accurate estimates are
acquired, seeds stop movement and estimation and forward
the position estimates to the corresponding sensor nodes.
After acquiring the position estimates, the sensor nodes
act as pseudo-seeds to aid their neighboring non-positioned
common sensor nodes in acquiring position estimates. Since
pseudo-seeds have no GPS receivers, their own position
information has to be estimated during the maneuvers.
Each pseudo-seed chooses its optimal motion direction to
minimize the uncertainty of its neighboring nodes’ position
estimates and its own position estimate with an information-
theoretic utility measure as the objective function. This
measure is different from that of the seeds. After the pseudo-
seeds acquire accurate position estimates of their neighbor-
ing non-positioned common sensors, the pseudo-seeds stop
movement and estimation and forward the position estimates
to the corresponding common sensor nodes. By repeating
this process, all sensor nodes can obtain accurate position
estimates.
The core of information-theoretic hierarchical localization
algorithm lies in that seed estimates its neighboring sensor
nodes’ positions through bearing measurements obtained
through active movements. Although the positions of sensor
nodes can be estimated from a sequence of bearing measure-
ments obtained by random maneuvers of seed or pseudo-
seed with the Stanﬁeld algorithm, the maximum likelihood
or the Kalman ﬁlter [10], [11], clearly course maneuvers
have an effect on estimation. This effect is analyzed with

the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) in [12]. Optimization
of observer trajectories for bearings-only ﬁxed-target local-
ization is designed by maximizing the determinant of the
Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) [13]. It has been shown
that the active maneuvers can greatly enhance the estimator’s
performance (i.e., accuracy, stability, and convergence rate).
Mutual information can be used to measure the value of a
sensing action for its associated reduction in uncertainty [14].
In our research, mutual information which formally mea-
sures the utility of a observation obtained by a maneuver for
its associated reduction in uncertainty of position estimates
is used as the objective function.

The ﬁlter of a seed only estimates the positions of its
neighboring common sensor nodes. However, the ﬁlter of
a pseudo-seed needs to estimate both the positions of its
neighboring non-positioned common sensor nodes and its
own position. Their information-theoretic utility measures
are different.
2) Localization via seeds: With the known positions of
seeds, the position estimates of neighboring non-positioned
common sensor nodes are irrelative with each other. Assume
that b x

is the position estimate of the

measurements up to time k, and its corresponding estimated

of the N

for position estimation.

Although, the simplicity of the update stage of the infor-

plexity in the prediction stage, the non-positioned common
sensor nodes stay at rest and have no dynamics during the
localization process. Thus, the prediction is also simple

The mutual information gain for the position estimates of

In our case, the seed’s velocity is constant during the
localization process. It is preferred that the seed’s movement
direction maximizes its mutual information deﬁned as above.
The seed actively moves for minimizing the uncertainty in
position estimates of its neighboring non-positioned common
sensor nodes by solving

Here, the set of available actions represents the possible
movement direction changes exerted on the seed. The con-
trol vector parameterization is used to determine a direct
numerical solution for the movement direction of seed with
zero-look-ahead [15].
With the mutual information as control objective, the seed
moves along the trajectory that maximizes the reduction of
estimate uncertainty. After several active movements, the
information ﬁlter of the seed can obtain accurate enough
position estimates of its neighboring non-positioned common
sensor nodes. As soon as the accurate position estimates
are obtained after several purposeful maneuvers, the seed
will stop movement and forward the position estimates to
the corresponding common sensor nodes. After receiving
the position estimates, the common sensor nodes can act as
pseudo-seeds.

3) Localization via pseudo-seeds: Although the pseudo-
seed has acquired accurate enough position estimate, its
position error accumulates with its movements. Its own
position information X
ps
(k) must be estimated along with
the position information of the neighboring non-positioned
common sensor nodes x
c;i
;i = 1;¢¢¢;N
c
. Assuming each
sensor node is mounted with a compass, the pseudo-seed’s
heading does not need to be estimated. The augmented state
vector at time k of extended Kalman ﬁlter of the pseudo-
seed is X(k)=[X

The neighboring non-positioned common sensor nodes stay
at rest.
The non-linear discrete-time state transition equation is:
X(k)= f(X(k¡ 1);u

The position estimates of the pseudo-seed and its neigh-
boring non-positioned common seeds are relative. Extended
Kalman ﬁlter is implemented to generate estimate

: (19)
Since the position estimates of the neighboring non-
positioned common sensor nodes and the pseudo-seed are
relative, the mutual information gain between the posterior
states and measurements is different from that of the seed’s
ﬁlter. Under Gaussian multivariate assumption, the mutual
information gain is calculated by
I

(logjP(kjk¡ 1)j¡ logjP(kjk)j): (20)
During the localization process, the pseudo-seed’s velocity
is constant. We optimize the pseudo-seed’s movement direc-
tion by maximizing the above mutual information,

The pseudo-seed moves along the trajectory that maxi-
mizes the reduction of the whole estimate uncertainty. After
several active movements, the pseudo-seed could obtain the
position estimates of its neighboring non-positioned com-
mon sensor nodes. Then, the pseudo-seed stops movement
and forwards the position estimates to the corresponding
non-positioned common sensor nodes. The accuracy of the
position estimates of the neighboring non-positioned com-
mon sensor nodes can not surpass the accuracy of position
estimates of the pseudo-seed. Due to the process noise
of pseudo-seeds and the bearing observation noise, the
estimated errors of non-positioned common sensor nodes
accumulate with increasing levels.

B. Error convergence analysis of information-driven mobil-
ity vs. random, heuristic mobility for one common sensor
node with one seed
Seed uses extended Kalman ﬁlter to estimate its neigh-
boring non-positioned common sensor node’s position with
bearing measurements. A series of bearing measurements
can be obtained by random or purposeful maneuvers. Differ-
ent maneuvers obtain different bearing measurements with
different information values for position estimates. We ﬁrst
simulate a simple case that there is one seed and one non-
positioned common sensor node in the sensing/transmission
region of the seed. We compare the convergence of estimated
error of one non-positioned common sensor node with one
mobile seed in the ﬁve cases: seed mobility is driven by
information maximizing, information minimizing, heuristic
(moves straight forward to the position estimate or moves
perpendicularly to the direction pointing to the position
estimate) and random.
Figure 3 shows the different trajectories of the seed and
estimated error convergence driven by different mobility. At
t = 0s, the seed observes and obtains the ﬁrst bearing mea-
surement of the common sensor node. The initial position
estimate at t= 0s is a random position in the sensing section
of the seed. Assume that the initial position estimate is the
same in the ﬁve cases. At the ﬁrst step, the seed does not
move. An extended Kalman ﬁlter is used to estimate the
position of the common sensor node with the ﬁrst bearing
measurement. Because the seed does not move, the seed
obtains the same bearing measurement in the ﬁve cases.
Thus, the estimated errors at t = 1s are the same in the ﬁve
cases. Then, the seed performs a maneuver with the velocity
V
s
= 0:5m=s. Driven by the different mobility, the seed moves
to different directions and obtains different measurements at
new positions in the ﬁve cases. With the different bearing
measurements, the extended Kalman ﬁlter can get different
position estimates at t = 2s. It can be seen in Figure 3
that the most informative bearing measurement is obtained
by the ﬁrst maneuver with the information-driven mobility
(information-maximizing).

tic mobility. It can be seen that the position estimates error
becomes convergent to 0:24m after only 5 maneuvers with
information-driven mobility. The extended Kalman ﬁlter only
runs fewer than 5 times for the position estimates. Although
the position estimates can become convergent with random
and heuristic mobility, the most accurate position estimates
can be acquired with the fewest number of maneuvers
by means of information-driven mobility. The energy con-
sumption on movements for localization and computation
complexity decrease greatly.
C. Analysis of error accumulation of the proposed hierar-
chical localization algorithm
The proposed algorithm is a hierarchical localization ap-
proach. It is necessary to address the error accumulation
problem. The process noise of pseudo-seeds and the bearing
observation noise cause accumulation of estimates errors of
common sensor nodes. These increase as localization levels
increase. We compare the estimates errors at different levels

by varying the magnitude of process noise of pseudo-seeds
and the bearing observation noise respectively.
Tables II and III show that estimates errors increase with
the localization levels. Error accumulation results from the
process noise of pseudo-seeds and the bearing observation
noise. With the increase of the magnitude of process noise of
pseudo-seeds and the bearing observation noise, the estimates
errors accumulate dramatically.
D. Performance evaluation of the proposed localization al-
gorithm in a large-scale sensor network
We evaluate the performance of the proposed hierarchical
localization algorithm in a large-scale sensor network. The
environment is 100m£100m. There are 300 common sensor
nodes. They are randomly scattered in the environment.
There are one, two or four seeds in the network respectively.
We compare the average estimates errors of common sensor
nodes, the total maneuvers done by seeds and pseudo-seeds
and the total time for localization with different mobility:
information-driven and random. We run the simulation 10
times and obtain the results shown in Table IV .
Table IV shows that the large-scale wireless sensor net-
work localization with information-driven mobility with only
one seed needs about 67:84s, and about 969 maneuvers done
by seeds and pseudo-seeds. The ﬁnal average estimates error
of common sensor nodes with information-driven mobility
is about 1:48m. With random mobility, localization needs
about 125:7s, and about 1880 maneuvers done by seeds and
pseudo-seeds. The ﬁnal average estimates error with random
mobility is about 1:74m. For the similar estimate accuracy,

the information-driven mobility localization algorithm needs
do about half of the number of maneuvers with random
mobility.
It is also shown that with the increasing number of seeds,
the localization accuracy improves, the convergence time
decreases, and the number of maneuvers for convergence
decrease. The information-driven hierarchical localization
algorithm can acquire accurate position estimates very fast
even with low seed density.
E. Analysis and comparison with other seed-controllable-
mobility-assisted localization algorithms
Compared with other seed-controllable-mobility-assisted
localization algorithms, the proposed localization algorithm
is distinctive in that:
First, seeds and pseudo-seeds run extended Kalman ﬁlters
with bearing measurements to estimate positions of non-
positioned neighboring common sensor nodes. Uncertainty
can be processed reasonably with extended Kalman ﬁlters.
Second, controllable mobility driven by an information
measure is found to be very helpful for localization. The
mutual information between the position estimates of neigh-
boring non-positioned common sensors and the motion di-
rections of seeds or pseudo-seeds is measured to optimize the
motion of seeds or pseudo-seeds. With the most informative
bearing measurements obtained by the purposeful move-
ments, the uncertainty in position estimates of neighboring
sensors can be quickly reduced.
IV. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we present an information-driven intelli-
gent mobility assisted hierarchical localization algorithm for
mobile sensor networks. We utilize an information-theoretic
utility measure for seeds and pseudo-seeds, for the purpose
of localizing their neighboring common sensor nodes. With
this measure as the objective function, the seeds and pseudo-
seeds actively choose their movement directions to minimize
the uncertainty in position estimates of their neighboring
common sensor nodes.
The simulation experiments show that with bearing mea-
surements acquired through active movements of seeds or
pseudo-seeds, accurate position estimates of neighboring
common sensor nodes can be obtained with fewer maneuvers
than with random mobility.
In this paper, with the use of the information-theoretic
utility measure, seeds and pseudo-seeds only have to do a
limited number of maneuvers to acquire position estimates of
all sensor nodes. We have conducted the theoretical analysis
and computer simulations. However, there are still some
issues for its practical applications in real environments, such
as data association and time synchronization, which are big
problems of wireless sensor network system.
