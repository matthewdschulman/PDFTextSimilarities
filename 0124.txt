Ports for Robotic Single-Port Access Surgery

Abstract—This paper presents a novel kinematic control
scheme based on the Virtual Incision Ports (VIPs) for redun-
dancy resolution of redundant robotic arms for single-port
access (SPA) surgery. In general, manipulators have 6 DoFs
except grippers to be able to reach the desired pose in 3D
space. If a surgical robot for SPA surgery has only 6 DoFs,
then its workspace could be restricted severely. Therefore most
robots including our developed robot consist of more than 6
DoFs with an elbow to maintain triangulation. This means
they have a redundancy resolution problem. One of the most
popular methods for a redundancy resolution is a pseudo-
inverse Jacobian method [1]. In case of robotic SPA surgery,
however, this method intrinsically has a high possibility for
hurting abdominal organs and muscles or conﬂicting with other
instruments because of the unexpected elbow movements. Our
control scheme can decrease the possibility of a collision with
themandprovideamoreﬂexibleworkingareaforsurgicaltasks
by reallocating the VIP. Results presented from simulation and
experiment will demonstrate them.
I. INTRODUCTION
Single-port access (SPA) surgery is a recently developed
laparoscopic procedure that involves passing multiple instru-
ments and an endoscope through a single incision [2][3]. It
is a minimally invasive surgical procedure in which surgeon
operates almost exclusively through a single entry point,
typically the patients navel. When compared with traditional
multi-port access (MPA) surgery techniques, the beneﬁts of
SPA techniques include less postoperative pain, reduction of
the incidense of wound infections, and less cosmetic hurts
[4].
Despite the potential advantages of SPA surgery tech-
niques, there may also be limitations such as inadequate tri-
angulation and an impaired view at positions in line with the
instrument [5]. Additionally, the small operation space can
make it difﬁcult to manipulate surgical instruments and an
endoscope because they are passed through a single incision.
These problems can be solved by the improved ergonomic
design, accuracy, and dexterity provided by teleoperated
robotic surgery systems. Many researchers have attempted
to apply robotics technologies to SPA surgery.
A number of manual single-site surgeries have been
successfully performed by adopting an endoscopic robot
[6][7]. The aim of these studies was to substitute a robotic
manipulating system for the assistant surgeon tasked with
manipulating the endoscope. These studies efﬁciently over-
came space limitations of the operation site. Many other

robotic devices are currently being developed to address the
dexterityand visualization limitations for SPA surgery and to
improve tissue manipulation capabilities as well as internal
organ visualization.
In one approach, robotics technologies have been applied
to instruments as well as endoscopes. In this approach,
the surgery area is accessed by an overtube that includes
the surgical instruments and an endoscope, and surgery is
performed locally. Examples include a bimanual robotic
system with two arms having six degrees of freedom (DoFs)
for single-port laparoscopy [8], or that with a deployable
mechanical structure and stereo vision [9][10]. Master-slave
robotic systems that use long ﬂexible instruments with mul-
tiple DoFs alongside existing ﬂexible endoscopes are cur-
rentlybeingdeveloped[11][12].Theseovertube-typesurgery
robotshaveasingleroboticarmthatmanipulatesanovertube
outside the patient’s body. A surgeon can efﬁciently perform
small-part surgery because the surgical instruments and an
endoscope are deployed from the same overtube, which can
be ﬂexible or rigid. However, view-independent instrument
motion is limited by the overtube, and ﬂexible overtubes
can also degrade the stiffness of the instrument end. These
problems can be more serious when multi-DoF motions of
theinstrumentandanendoscopemustbeimplementedinside
the body.
Another approach for single-site surgery involves substi-
tutingthesurgeon’shandwitharoboticarm;articulatedrigid
instruments and an endoscope are connected to a robotic
arm outside of the body and passed through the single
incision. In particular, a remote center-of-motion (RCM)
mechanism can be used to maintain the stationary point
at the incision area. The da Vinci system from Intuitive
Surgical, Inc. has been used to improve surgical dexterity for
performing transumbilical single-port radical prostatectomy,
dismemberedpyeloplasty,andright-sideradicalnephrectomy
procedures [13]. Instruments modiﬁed for triangulation are
also used in single-incision surgery performed with the da
Vincisystem[14].Aninstrumentthatpossesseshighstiffness
can be applied with relatively high force to the tissue and
manipulated in a large workspace. Recently, a more compact
system to position and manipulate the surgical instruments
has been proposed conceptually. The system is composed of
two instruments and one endoscope attached to a common
rotating base ring [15]. In this approach, the key requirement
is to maintain triangulation of the instruments.
In general, manipulators should have 6 DoFs except grip-
pers to reach the desired pose in 3D space. If a surgical robot
for SPA surgery has only 6 DoFs, then its workspace should

be limited so much. Therefore most robots including our
robot consist of more than 6 DoFs with an elbow to main-
tain triangulation. These are required redundancy resolution
methods. One of most popular methods for a redundancy
resolution might be pseudo-inverse Jacobian method [1]. In
robotic SPA surgery, however, this method intrinsically has
high possibility for hurting abdominal organs because of un-
expected elbow movements. In this paper, we present a novel
kinematic control scheme based on the Virtual Incision Port
(VIP) in robotic SPA surgery. This control scheme decreases
collision possibility between the instrument and something,
e.g organs and another instrument, through deterministic
elbow movements. In some cases it may incur restriction
of motion of instruments. Adjustment of working area with
reallocation of the VIP can resolve this restriction so that
provide sufﬁcient working area for surgical task.
This paper is organized as follows. Surgical robotic arms
for robotic SPA surgery developed by us recently will be
presented in Section 2 in brief. Concept and properties of
the proposed control scheme will be described in Section
3. Simulation results to evaluate validation of the proposed
control scheme will be presented in Section 4. Experimental
results will be presented in Section 5. Finally, conclusion
will be presented in Section 6.
II. SYSTEM DESCRIPTION
A. A Surgical Robotic Arm for SPA Surgery
We have developed a surgical robot system including a
couple of articulated robotic arms and an endoscope for
SPA surgery as seen in Fig. 1. A surgical robotic arm
consists of a conically shaped RCM mechanism [16][17]
and an articulated instrument with an elbow conﬁguration
to maintain triangulation. Each robotic arm has 9 DoFs
including 3 DoFs, q
1
to q
3
, for a conically shaped RCM
mechanism and 6 DoFs for the instrument which consists
of redundant 2 DoFs, q
4
and q
5
, for wrist translation and 3
DoFs for wrist orientation, and 1 DoF for grippers. In this
paper we will consider only 5 DoFs,q

III. KINEMATIC CONTROL SCHEME BASED ON THE
VIRTUAL INCISION PORT (VIP)
A. Concept
We present a novel kinematic control scheme based on the
Virtual Incision Port (VIP). At ﬁrst we introduce the VIP
(V). It is a virtual incision port and acts as a virtual RCM.
The position of the VIP can be chosen anywhere in 3D space
conceptually.In the proposed control scheme, the VIP, elbow
(E), and wrist (W) exist in the same straight line as described
in Fig. 3. In other words, the VIP is exploited in order to
select the elbow position when the reference wrist position is
commanded.Actuallythismeansaredundancyresolutionfor

VIP,

then the elbow position ,

B. Properties
As shown in Fig. 3, the proposed control scheme provides
elbow movement boundaries for the speciﬁed working area.
4178
Fig. 5. Virtual Instruments and Virtual RCMs
This could improve surgery safety through deterministic
elbow movements. Fig. 4 shows that the working area can
be moved to somewhere according to the VIP position
modiﬁcation. Adjusting the VIP position provides surgeons
with a large working area. The VIPs act as virtual RCMs for
pivoting the virtual instruments as shown in Fig. 5. Through
the virtual instrument, a surgeon is able to manipulate the
curved instruments as if she does straight things in robotic
MPA surgery. Therefore surgeons accustomed to robotic
MPA surgery widely used will be able to operate robotic
SPA surgery more easily. According to selection of the VIPs
the working area of the instruments can be affected. In some
cases the static VIPs may not give enough working area to
operate,soproperselectionoftheVIPsshouldbeconsidered.
C. Selection of the VIP
Selecting the VIP should be considered in both engi-
neering and medical aspects. For exmaple, in engineering
aspect it would be considered to provide large working area
as possible, and in medical aspect it would be considered
to provide effective and safe poses of the instruments for
surgery. Its optimal selection to satisfy both sides, however,
is a very challenging problem. Until now it has not been
resolved clearly. At current status we introduce a heuristic
method to determine the VIP position. This has been applied
to our experiments successfully.
Procedure of the VIP selection
Refer to Fig. 3.
Step 1. Determine working area (e.g. organ).
Step 2. Adjust manually elbow (E) and wrist (W) of
the instrument considering organs and muscles which
should be avoided.
Step 3. Compute

RW via forward kinematics
using each joint angle which is read from sensors, e.g.

IV. SIMULATION
We have evaluated the proposed control scheme through
simulation. For convenience we have assumed that there is
no limitation of range of motion of each joint in the robotic
arms. In Fig. 6, the black line is the reference wrist trajectory
and the computed wrist trajectory by the proposed control
scheme. The blue line is the computed elbow trajectory,
and a red  is the VIP(0.0420,-0.0554,-0.0803) used in this
simulation. Given every reference wrist position, ﬁrstly each
joint angle, q
1
to q
5
, is computed by inverse kinematics
solution described in Section II in real time. Then these are
sent to each joint as control inputs. Through simulation we
have shown that the reference wrist and the computed wrist
trajectory are equivalent. This means the control scheme is
working exactly. Additionally as shown in Fig. 6 we can see
the elbow trajectory is similar to the wrist trajectory, which
demonstrates that elbow movement can be deterministic.
Fig. 6. The trajectory of wrist and elbow by inverse kinematics from given
reference wrist [m] (R is origin. VIP (0.0420,-0.0554,-0.0803))
Graphically to demonstrate movement of the arms con-
trolled by the proposed scheme, we have introduced an open
source simulator OpenRAVE [18]. Instrument movements
with the VIP based control scheme are superimposed in Fig.
7.TheVIPsareﬁxedduringoperationandthestraightvirtual
instruments (green lines) are operated as our expectation.
V. EXPERIMENT
A. Setup
Our robotic SPA surgery system is composed of a master
system, a slave system, and a control system as shown in
4179
Fig. 7. Superimposing of the instrument movements with the VIP based
control scheme: The VIPs are ﬁxed during operation and the wrist position
tracks given reference position exactly. Trajectory of elbow and wrist are
represented in Fig. 6.
Fig. 8. A couple of omega7 haptic devices by Force Dimen-
sion [19] have been used for a master system to generate
surgeon’s command input for operating the robotic arms. We
have developed a slave system which consists of both robotic
arms, an endoscope with a stereo camera for 3D display, and
agantryforsupportingthem.Forthecontrolsystem,wehave
developed a PC based controller using off-the-shelf motion
controllers, NI-7350 from National Instruments Corp. [20].
The PC based controller also provides interface to omega7
for surgeon’s command input. Control periods for each axis
in motion controllers have been set to 4KHz. Surgeon’s
command input via omega.7 is transmitted to a slave system
every 40ms.

B. Practical Consideration: Selection of the VIP
In practical selection of the VIP is necessary to be
considered with respect to range of motion of each joint.
Empirically initial joint angles are recommended to be in
the middle of range of motion as possible after completing
Step 2 in procedure of the VIP selection. Table I shows angle
limits applied in our experiment. We also have set j
    !
EVj to
0.05m.

surgical sites. In Fig. 9 (a) the instrument can move around
right site. When it moves to left site, inverse kinematics
solution could fail because of limitation of range of motion
of some joints. This can be resolved by modiﬁcation of the
VIP like Fig. 9 (b). In current status this task should be
performed by a surgeon, but in the future automatic and
dynamic reallocation of the VIPs on operation would be
necessary.
Wehaveinvestigatedthefeasibilityoftheproposedcontrol
scheme based on the VIP through the peg transfer and
suturing using Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery (FLS)
trainersystem [21] as shownin Fig. 10. Asa result of 7 trials
ofthe pegtransfer and 8 trials of suturing , each elapsed time
has decreased by 40.6% and 49.1% in Fig. 11, respectively.

VI. CONCLUSIONS
We have presented the kinematic control scheme via
the VIP for redundant robotic arms for SPA surgery. The
scheme introduces the virtual incision ports which robotic
instruments with the elbows can be manipulated as straight
things. This can improve surgery safety because each elbow
of instruments moves deterministic and within boundary. In
some cases it may incur restriction of motion of instruments.
However adjustment of working area through reallocation of
the VIP can resolve this problem as described in experiment.
In simulation we have presented the proposed scheme works
correctly. It has proven inverse kinematics solution is ac-
curate that the reference wrist positions and the computed
wrist positions are equivalent. Curved instruments have been
operated like straight things with the VIPs. In experiment
we have demonstrated the proposed scheme can be applied
to robotic SPA surgery through performing the peg transfer
and suturing.
In future work, we will investigate methods to determine
the optimal VIPs dynamically on operation. This will be
considered to maximize working area and avoid undesirable
obstacles automatically.
