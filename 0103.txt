A Dynamic and Uncalibrated Method to Visually Servo-control
Elastic Deformations by Fully-constrained Robotic Grippers
David Navarro-Alarcon and Yun-hui Liu
AbstractÑIn this paper, we address the set-point deforma-
tion control of elastic objects by fully-constrained grippers.
We propose an uncalibrated Lyapunov-based algorithm that
iteratively estimates the deformation Jacobian matrix, with no
prior knowledge of the deformation and camera models. With
this new method we show how, by combining pose information
of the grippers with several visual measurements, we can
independently control elastic deformations of unknown objects.
We report experiments with a 6-DOF robot manipulator to
validate this control approach.
I. INTRODUCTION
In recent years, the problem of the active deformation
control of compliant objects has received signiÞcant at-
tention from the robotics research community. This inter-
est in controlling deformations seems to come from the
recent advances in surgical robotics [1], the progress in
home/personal-robotics[2],andtheautomationofnewappli-
cations that require to manipulate soft bodies, e.g. handling
foodmaterials[3],orsuturing[4].Notethatinmanyapplica-
tions (specially those in the medical Þeld), the manipulated
objects usually have uncertain deformation properties; this
situation clearly complicates the practical implementation.
The research community has made signiÞcant contribu-
tionssincethework[5],whichtoourknowledge,reportsone
of the earliest efforts to comprehensively address this topic.
Some researchers have studied the active shaping of rheo-
logical materials, see e.g. [6], [7]. To control deformations,
these methods must Þrst identify the objectÕs visco-elastic
properties. For objects that exhibit elastic deformations only,
some researchers have proposed explicit feedback control
methods to indirectly position deformable feature points,
see e.g. [8]Ð[11]. These model-based controllers also require
prior calibration of deformation and vision models.
Irrespectively of the materialÕs properties, most controllers
in the literature require a-priori knowledge of a deformation
model, albeit approximated. Very few works address the
simultaneous online estimation and control of elastic defor-
mations (note that standard visual servoing, e.g. classical
[12] or uncalibrated methods [13], do not address active
deformation). Moreover, most existing methods only use
the manipulatorÕs linear displacements to actively control
deformations; since these control algorithms do not consider
rotations/torsions, they can only impose a limited set of

shapes onto the object. For example, [7] presents a method
tocontrolone-dimensionaldeformations(i.e.linearcompres-
sions),whereas[8]Ð[10]formulatethedeformationcontroller
considering plane motion of the manipulator (these methods
can only control up-to two degree-of-freedom (DOF) with
a single manipulator). Recently, [11] proposed a method to
control deformations with the 6-DOF motion of the end-
effector;thiscontroller,however,requiresa-prioriknowledge
of the objectÕs deformation properties.
In this paper, we present a new image-based approach to
servo-controlelasticdeformations.Byincorporatingthegrip-
perÕs attitude and several visual measurements, our method
can independently control elastic deformations with the 6-
DOF motion of the manipulatorÑsomething we can not
achieve with existing controllers including our previous
formulations [14], [15]. The uncalibrated method that we
present does not require identiÞcation of the deformation
and camera models. For that, we derive a Lyapunov-based
algorithm that computes the unknown deformation Jacobian
matrix in real-time. We report a 6-DOF experimental study
to validate the feasibility of our new set-point deformation
controller.
The rest of this manuscript has the following structure:
In Section II we derive the mathematical models. Section
III details our control method. In Section IV we report the
experiments. Section V gives conclusions and future work.
II. MATHEMATICAL MODELLING
A. Manipulator model
Consider a serial non-redundant manipulator with revolute
joints and an exactly known kinematic structure. We denote
the vectors of joint displacements by q ? R
n
and end-
effector pose (position + orientation) by x?R
n
. The time-
derivative of the pose vector yields the expression
ú x =
¶x
¶q
(q)ú q, (1)
where the matrix
¶x
¶q
(q) ? R
n?n
denotes the analytical
Jacobian matrix of the manipulator.
In this paper we only consider kinematically-controlled
manipulators, e.g. as reported in [16]. Therefore, the angular
velocity ú q physically stands for the control input to the
system. Note that in real experimental systems this velocity
input typically presents saturation.
B. Deformation model
We consider the case where the robot manipulator phys-
ically interacts with soft objects that exhibit elastic defor-
mations only. To actively modify the objectÕs shape, the

manipulator has a robotic gripper which rigidly grasps the
elastic body in a fully-constrained manner. Physically, this
situation means that the motion of the manipulatorÕs tip (in
any linear or rotational direction) produces deformations on
the body.
To represent the elastic conÞguration of the object, we
use k feature points r
i

, for i = 1...,k, located
over the surface of the object (see Fig. 1 for a conceptual
representation). We locally model the quasi-static relation
between the pose x and each feature point r

not impose severe implementation constraints to our method

D. Deformation feature
To obtain a quantitative metric of the objectÕs shape (and
thus avoid the open-loop response of robot-centred methods,
e.g. [18]), we introduce the vision-dependent function
y =y(s)?R
h
; for h² n, (10)
which we call the deformation feature vector. The coor-
dinates of this smooth function can represent, e.g. visual
displacements, angles, curvatures, line features, etcetera (see
[15]). By time-differentiating this function we obtain
ú y =J(s)ú x, (11)
4458
where J(s) ? R
h?n
represents the deformation Jacobian
matrix and has the following deÞnition:
J(s) =
¶y
¶s
(s)L. (12)
Note that we can not exactly compute this matrix since it
contains unknown terms, namely, the matrix L.
III. CONTROLLER DESIGN
As with traditional visual servoing approaches [12], we
design our controller in terms of the end-effector velocities,
therefore, we deÞnev = ú x?R
n
as the new control variable.

a-priori information of the deformation and camera models.
A. Lyapunov-based estimator
In order to minimise the deformation error ?y, we must
Þrst estimate how the gripperÕs linear and rotational motions
actively deform the elastic object. For that, in this section
we present an adaptive algorithm that computes an online
estimation of the vector of parameters ?; we denote this
adaptive vector by
b
? ? R
g
. Note that with the vector
b
?
we can construct an estimation of the unknown projection-
deformation matrix L, and in turn, an estimation of the
deformation Jacobian matrix J(s).

Proof: Considering the linearly parametrised error (15),
we can re-write the update rule as
ú

?
(s, ú x)KA(s, ú x)??. (18)
To prove the stability of the online estimator, we introduce

From the LyapunovÕs direct method [19], we see that the
update rule provides a stable (thus bounded) computation
of
b
?. Note that since kú xk and k¬ xk have upper bounds,
then, simple computations can show thatk
¬
Vk has also upper
bounds. From the BarbalatÕs lemma [19], we prove that as
time approaches inÞnity, the ßow error e?0

In our method, we compute the Jacobian matrix in real-
time and with no model calibration as follows:
b
J(s) =

. (21)
Remark 1: The update rule (17) does not guarantee the
identiÞcation of the true parameters? or the Jacobian matrix
J(s). We design our iterative algorithm with the objective of
continuously satisfying the kinematic relation:
ú y =
b
J(s)ú x. (22)
This approach resembles the method in [20].
B. Dynamic velocity control
In our method, we use the smooth velocity control input
v =
b
J

(s)p, (23)
where the matrix
b
J

stands for the MooreÐ

represents damping.
Proposition 2: The dynamic velocity control input (23)
asymptotically minimises the deformation error ?y.

IV. EXPERIMENTS
A. Setup
Fig. 3 shows the 6-DOF (n = 6) robot manipulator that
we use to conduct the experimental study. This mechanical
system has an open architecture servo-controller that allows
to set the joint velocity in real-time (see [15] for details).
The manipulatorÕs gripper rigidly grasps a 2?12?25 mm
soft foam sheet; we place artiÞcial markers on the surface
of this object. To acquire the visual feedback, we use two
C310 Logitech cameras.
B. Case of study
We test the performance of our control method with
two different 4-DOF deformation tasks (this situation corre-
sponds to y = [y

task we only consider a single view (m = 1) of the

the deformation feature vector with the pixel coordinates

In the second task we use two cameras (m = 2) to observe
the upper and side views of the object; the experiment
consists in simultaneously position one deformable point and
two angle features (see Fig. 5). We construct the deformation
vector with four visual feedback points s

C. Results
Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 show snapshots of the conducted ex-
periments. The overlaid red and green ÒcurvesÓ represent
the feedback deformation features and the desired constant
targets, respectively.
We Þrst present the results of the single-view point posi-
tioning experiment. Fig. 6 depicts the asymptotic minimi-
sation of the four deformation errors ?y

. Fig. 7 shows
the resulting Cartesian displacements of the gripper. To
demonstrate the accuracy of our uncalibrated method, in
Fig. 8 and Fig. 9 we present graphical comparisons of the
visuallymeasured deformationßow ú y andtheßow estimated
by f =

Now, we present the results of the two-view point-angle
deformation experiment. Fig. 10 depicts the asymptotic min-
imisation of the pixel and radian deformation errors. Finally,
Fig. 11 shows the relative displacements of the gripper. To
the best of our knowledge, this paper reports for the Þrst time
the simultaneous control of 4 independent deformation DOF
by a single manipulator. In [15], we also report the control
of 4-DOF, but jointly performed by two manipulators. The
control of deformation via rotations results instrumental to
our method. Approaches like [8] only consider plane motion,

emphasise that the grasping conÞguration plays a crucial role
in our formulation. Also note that the manipulator can only
drive the features to physically reasonable targets.

of our controller with different deformation control experi-

V. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we presented a visual servoing method
to servo-control deformations of unknown elastic objects
with the 6-DOF motion of the manipulator. To cope with
the uncertain vision/deformation models, we Þrst derived
an algorithm that online estimates the Jacobian matrix.
Next,wepresentedadynamic-statefeedbackvelocitycontrol
law which provides smooth trajectories to the manipulator.
Finally, we reported experimental results to validate the
controller.
In this new method, we incorporate the orientation of the
fully-constrained grippers into the estimation algorithm. This
feature allows us to: (i) increase the number of controllable
deformation DOF, and (ii) extend the dimension of the
JacobianÕs kernel. In our early study [14], we noted that
n = 3 has a restricted number of reachable conÞgurations

(singularities tend to arise in this situation). In contrast with
our previous estimator [15], the stability (convergence) of
our new online algorithm can be proved with Lyapunov-
like theory; we must remark that this method requires slow
motion of the manipulator and proper Þltering of the visually
measured ßow signals.
As future work, we want to use the stereo vision system to
estimate the 3D deformation of the object. Additionally, we
would like to extend this uncalibrated controller to perform
shared (robot-human) deformation tasks.
