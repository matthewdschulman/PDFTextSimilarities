AbstractÑ In this paper, we conduct a comparative study
of three well known robot kinematic calibration algorithms,
namely the Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) parameter algorithm, the
product of exponentials (POE) algorithm, and the local POE
(LPOE) algorithm. To cope with distinct formulations associ-
ated to different algorithms, we propose a uniÞed geometric
framework which is based on POE kinematics and a novel
Adjoint error model. The Adjoint error model offers us an
extremely efÞcient way to benchmark the aforesaid calibration
algorithms, and also compare them to a novel calibration
algorithm based on the Adjoint error model.
I. INTRODUCTION
A. Problem statement
The proliferation of industrial robots in the com-
puter/communication/consumer electronics (3C) manufactur-
ing industry calls for more capable robots that match the
precision requirement and complexity of typical 3C assembly
tasks. Robust and efÞcient robot calibration technology is
the key to bringing an average industrial robots to this
challenging new scenario.
Robot calibration involve three levels of activities [1]:
the joint level calibration, kinematic (geometric) calibration
and the non-kinematic (non-geometric) calibration. Since
the geometric error of robot manipulators accounts for over
ninety-Þve percent of overall error [2], kinematic calibration
becomes a major means to improve robot precision. Great
efforts have been put into developing a robust and efÞcient
kinematic calibration algorithm [1,3]Ð[5]. The robustness
refers to it capability of handling exceptions in robot kine-
matic parametrization and error modeling.
The robustness and efÞciency of calibration algorithms are
of crucial importance to its successful implementation in 3C
robotics, where automatic calibration and re-calibration is
taking the future trend. It becomes necessary to reconsider
the aforementioned calibration algorithms in a comparative
manner. This seemingly simple task is hindered by the essen-
tial differences among the various calibration algorithms, in
particular in kinematic parametrization, error modeling and
error update methods.

There are two types of kinematics parametrization for
robot manipulators: the Denavit-Hartenberg (D-H) conven-
tion [6,7] and the product of exponentials (POE) convention
[8,9]. D-H convention [6] is based on parametrization of
homogeneous matrix between consecutive coordinate frames
that are attached to each link of the robot, including the base
and the end-effector. The POE convention [9] is based on
parametrization of each joint axis in its initial conÞguration,
and with respect to a single reference frame. While D-H
based calibration algorithms update the D-H parameters di-
rectly, POE based algorithms update the joint twists instead.
This paper conducts a comparative study of three well
known calibration algorithms in a uniÞed geometric frame-
work. First, we introduce the concept of quotient space to
give a uniÞed comparison of the robustness of different
parametrization conventions, which are in terms of com-
pleteness, minimality and parametric continuity [10]. Then,
we propose the Adjoint error model for a uniÞed treatment
of the error models used in three calibration algorithms,
namely the Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) parameter algorithm,
the product of exponentials (POE) algorithm, and the local
POE (LPOE) algorithm. We also propose a fourth calibration
algorithm based on the Adjoint error model. The uniÞed
treatment of the four calibration algorithms Þnally leads
to an extremely easy method to compare their efÞciency
by counting the number of basic transformations involved
in their formulation. Side issues such as identiÞability and
parameter redundancy elimination are also discussed, with
details found in a sequel to this paper [11].
B. Organization of the Paper
This paper is organized as follows: in Section II, we give
a minimum review of the mathematical tools and notational
conventions needed for both the rest of and the sequel [11]
to this paper; in Section III, we propose a uniÞed geometric
framework for error modeling; in Section IV , we conduct a
comparative study of four calibration algorithms in terms
of robustness and efÞciency. In particular, we propose a
novel kinematic error model and an associated calibration
algorithm called the Adjoint error algorithm. Finally we give
our conclusion in Section V .

of
B w.r.t. A comprise the 3 columns of the orthogonal matrix

matrix multiplication, known as the 6-D special Euclidean

B. Describing Velocity Using the Lie Algebra se(3) of

The Adjoint map is the instantaneous version of the con-
jugation map I

, i.e. a change of coordinates for velocity.
Alternatively, it can be explained as a rigid displacement of
velocity.
At this point, we need to introduce the adjoint map,

Any rigid body motion is equivalent to a Þnite screw motion
[9], i.e. the exponential map exp : se(3) ? SE(3),

is surjective. Conversely, any velocity ? = (v

also instantaneously equivalent to that of a screw motion.
Thus we entitle a twist

a screw ?. Given a basis {ö ?

(14)
The 2nd-kind is also known as the product of exponentials
(POE), which represents the direct kinematics map of a 6-
DoF robot manipulator [9].
D. Describing Joint Motion and Axial Symmetry Using Lie
subgroups ofSE(3) and Quotient Spaces (basically follows
[14,15])
Lie subgroups of SE(3) are subsets that are closed under
group multiplication and inversion. They are often involved
in describing motion of primitive joints [12] and the sym-
metry of certain geometric entity [14]. For example, for a
constant screw?, the set{e
ö
??
|??R} forms a 1-D subgroup
of SE(3). It can be explained as the motion set generated
by a revolute (h = 0), a prismatic (h =°) or a helicoidal
joint (h6= 0), where ? is the joint variable.
Besides, an inÞnitely long cylinder or a directed line (or a
revolute joint axis) can be rotated about and translated along
its own axis without altering its conÞguration. The subset of
g ? SE(3) that Þxes ? = ((q? ?)

)
T
forms a 2-D

Similarly, the symmetry of a free vector ? = (v

T
(or a

(associated with ?) [12], denoted by X(?):

It can be used to describe pick-and-place motion (SCARA
motion). It is well known that the Lie subalgebra g of a Lie
subgroup G?SE(3), deÞned by g :={
ö
??se(3)|e
ö
?
?G},
is indeed a Lie algebra since it is closed under [¥,¥]. We
shall denote the Lie subalgebra of C(?) and X(?) by c(?)
and x(?) respectively:
c(?) = span{
ö
?,
ö
V
?
},x(?) = span{ö e
1
,ö e
2
,ö e

,
ö
½

}. (17)
Due to the existence of symmetry, the arbitrary displace-
ments Ad
g
? of a joint axis ? with g ? SE(3) are not in
one-to-one correspondence with elements g ? SE(3). The
true conÞguration space of ? is given by the collection of
all left cosets gC(?) (or gX(?)), denoted SE(3)/C(?) (or
SE(3)/X(?)):
SE(3)/C(?),{gC(?)|g?SE(3)}. (18)
SE(3)/C(?) (SE(3)/X(?)) is a 4 (2)-D quotient space
[15], which can be intuitively understood as what is left off
after removing the redundant symmetry informationC(?) (or
X(?)). The velocity space of SE(3)/C(?) can be naturally
identiÞed with se(3)/c(?):
se(3)/c(?),{ö ? + c(?)|ö ??se(3)}. (19)
the factor space of all afÞne subspaces ö ?+c(?) in se(3) (see
for example [16]). For any subspace
c
W(?) ? se(3) with
c
W(?)? c(?) =se(3), we have the following isomorphism:
¹ :
c
W(?)?se(3)/c(?),ö ?7? ö ? + c(?), ö ??
c
W(?). (20)
so that given a basis {ö ?

of

III. A UNIFIED ERROR MODEL FOR ROBOT
KINEMATICS CALIBRATION
A. The Problem of Kinematic Calibration
From now on, we let A be the spatial reference frame
S and B be the end-effector tool frame T . For kinematic
calibration, we need to consider the generalized direct kine-
matics (GDK) map of a robot manipulator, which describes
the end-effector motion of a robot manipulator as a function
of both its joint variables ? ? ? and kinematic parameters
K ?K:
f : ??K?SE(3),(?,K)7?g(?,K). (23)
When the actual value of? andK deviate from certain nom-
inal value
ø
? and
ø
K, a deviation ofg(?,K) fromg(
ø
?,
ø
K) can
be detected by external measurement devices. The problem
of calibration amounts to identifying the joint offset ?? =
??
ø
? and kinematic parameter error ?K =K?
ø
K from M
pose error measurements?g
m
=g(?
m
,K)?g(
ø
?
m
,
ø
K),m =
1,...,M. Usually, a linearization of the problem is used in
the identiÞcation process and then iterated (indicated by the
second superscript k) to converge to the true value:
?g

(24)
Since the dimension of ??K is higher than that of SE(3),
multiple conÞgurations?
m
are taken to solve for (??
k
,?K
k
)
in a least square manner. Most calibration algorithms follow
this routine and are essentially Newton algorithms.
Take the POE model for example, the GDK is given by
[9]:

(26)
Therefore, it sufÞces to consider the differential kinematics

simply have:

where? denotes the inverse of? in (7). Therefore we have:

(29)
We refer to ?

Ad
e
ö
?
i
?
i
s
ds as the integral Adjoint map and
denote it byiAd
ö
?i?i
. Based on this result, Okamura and Park
proposed the POE calibration algorithm [4]. It is pointed out
later by the Þrst author [17] and also [18] that ??
i
Õs and g
st
cannot be simultaneously identiÞed. In the rest of the paper,
all ??
i
Õs in the POE formulation are ignored without further
explanation.
1395
As pointed out in [4,18], since iAd
e
ö
??
is in general
invertible, the error update?? can take any value and ?+??
may not retain a constant pitchh. For h = 0 (revolute joint),
the following quadratic constraints are imposed after each
iteration [4,18]:
k?
k
i
k = 1, ?
k
i
T
áv
k
i
= 0,i = 1,...,6. (30)
As pointed in [17] and explained in Section II, joint axis
misalignment can be naturally thought of as an Adjoint error
?ö ??se(3):
??
k

e
?ö ?
k?

(31)
and therefore by chain rule:
?e
ö
??
e
?
ö
??
Å?iAd
e
ö
??
áad
?
á??. (32)
As as result, the Adjoint error update:
?
k+1
=Ad
e
?ö ?
k?
k
. (33)
elegantly removes the quadratic constraints (30) used in [4,
18]. (32) can be further reduced to:
(?e
ö
??
e
?
ö
??
)
?
Å
 
I?Ad
e
ö
??

??. (34)
2) The D-H (modiÞed D-H) approach [19,20]: Although
the D-H approach involves consecutive transformation of
local frames, its model for a single joint can be essentially
represented as a product of 4 exponentials:
g
i?1,i
=e
ö e6?i
e
ö e3di
e
ö e4?i
e
ö e1ai
=e
ö e6?i+ö e3di
e
ö e4?i+ö e1ai
.
(35)
The second equality in (35) holds since [ö e
6
,ö e
3
] = [ö e
4
,ö e
1
] =
0. Its differential is given by:
(?g

(e

??

?a
i
).
(36)
In other words, the DH approach model avoids the integral
Adjoint map iAd
(¥)
at the cost of computing four Adjoint
maps.
3) The local POE approach [5]: The LPOE approach is
a mixture of the D-H approach and the POE approach [5]. It
addresses the joint axis misalignment as errors in consecutive
frames attached to each link. The choice of local frames is
such that each joint axis is locally represented as ö e
6
:
h
i?1,i

áe
ö e6?i

. (37)
and therefore:
(?g

)
?
Å??
i
. (38)
During our recent investigation, we realize that the LPOE
approach, though inadequately explained in [5] and even
misunderstood in [18], is essentially equivalent to the ADJ
approach (but the error update is different). Since:

(40)
The second approximation in (40) holds since ??

According to our explanation in Section II-D, a
parametrization R
n
? SE(3)/C(?) of the joint axis con-
Þguration space is (locally) complete at a point if and only
if the sum of the range
c
W(?) of its equivalent Adjoint error
and c(?) equals se(3) (in fact we shall the sum is always
direct sum):
c
W(?)? c(?) =se(3). (41)
For the D-H parametrization, while
c
W(?) is spanned by:
?
1

6

=e
3
,
?

(42)
and c(?) is spanned by ? and V

(see (15)), where
? =Ad
e
ö e

?+ö e

?+ö e

. (43)
In other words, the D-H parametrization is complete at a
conÞguration (?,d,?,a) if and only if the direct kinemat-
ics of a 6-DoF robot manipulator with initial joint axes
(e
6
,e
3
,e
4
,e
1
,e
6
,e

) is not singular at the conÞguration
(?,d,?,a,¥,¥). It is easy to see that so long as ?6= 0 or ¹,
we have:
span{?
1
,...,?
4
;?,V
?
} =se(3). (44)
and the D-H parametrization is complete. When ? = 0 or
¹, V
?
= ±e
6
= ±?
1
and parametric discontinuity occurs.
The application of (44) is geometrically clearer than the
approach in [10]. Similarly, for the modiÞed D-H (Hayati) 4-
parametrization [20], we shall look at the singularity of the6-
DoF manipulator with initial joint axes (e
6
,e
1
,e
4
,e
5
,e
6
,e

)
at a conÞguration(?,a,?,?,¥,¥). The singularity set is very
complicated and will not be elaborated here.

For the ADJ parametrization,
c
W(?) is the image of (34).
From standard linear algebra [16]:
Im(I?Ad
e
ö
??
) = ker(I?Ad
T
e
ö
??
)
?
. (45)
It is trivial to prove that
ker(I?Ad
e
ö
??
) = c(?).
and that
ker(I?Ad
T
e
ö
??
) = span

?
v

,


,? =

.
for ? 6= N¹,N ? Z. Therefore,
c
W(?) = c(?)
?
and (41)
always hold. In other words, the ADJ parametrization is THE
most adaptive parametrization against singularity.
For the POE parametrization, we need to Þnd the equiva-
lent Adjoint error ?? such that Ad
e
?ö ?? = ? +d?. Since d?
can be any value and?+d? can also take any value, the POE
parametrization is also complete. However, it is necessarily
redundant. To see this, notice that ?? is small, we have:
Ad
e
?ö ?? =e
ad
?ö ?
?Å (I +ad
?ö ?
)?,
?d? =ad
??
? =?ad
?
??.
(46)
In other words, any effective update d? will only take the
value in the 4-D subspace Im(ad
?
) = c(?)
?
. The ineffective
updates are exactlykerad
?
= c(?). This shows that the claim
by [18] that the maximal identiÞable parameters for POE
parametrization to be 6r + 3r + 6 is false. Similarly, the
LPOE approach is globally complete and its redundancy lies
in the non-uniqueness of identiÞed local frames g
i?1,i
Õs, as
reported in [5].
B. Comparison on Error Jacobian Matrix
Without loss of generality, we shall only consider the case
of 6R robot manipulators with end-effector pose measure-
ments. For the D-H approach [19,20], since
g =

Y
i=0
e
ö e6?i+ö e3di

. (47)
the m-th sample block A

is given by:

(48)
Therefore a total of 28M exponential maps and 7M Adjoint
maps are computed to derive the error Jacobian matrix A.
For the POE approach [4,18], since

the m-th sample block A

Therefore a total of6M exponential maps,6M Adjoint maps
and integral 7M Adjoint maps are computed to derive the
error Jacobian matrix A.
For the LPOE approach [5], since
g = (

. (51)

6

6?42
. (52)
Therefore a total of 6M exponential maps and 6M Adjoint
maps are computed to derive the error Jacobian matrix A.
Finally, for the ADJ approach, since
g =

i=1

the m-th sample block A

(54)
Therefore a total of 6M exponential maps and 6M Adjoint
maps are computed to derive the error Jacobian matrix A.
1) Redundancy elimination: While POE and LPOE will
have ineffective updates due to redundancy, causing the algo-
rithms to stall at improper conÞgurations, the parametriza-
tion redundancy in the ADJ approach will cause the error
Jacobian matrix to be rank deÞcient. The kernel is exactly
the 12-D subspace c(?
1
) ? c(Ad

?
2
) ? ááá ? c(Ad
5
?
6
).
However, the kernel corresponds to zero singular values and
are automatically discarded by the pseudo-inverse subroutine
in MATLAB (based on SVD). An alternative solution is
to construct a basis B
i

2) Computation efÞciency: The number of key operations
of all four approaches is summarized in Table II. A numerical
test on the three classes of operations is conducted in MAT-
LAB, and the time for 1,000 runs on randomly generated
twists is listed in the last row of Table II.

The overall number of operations is listed in the bracket in
Table II. Since roughly, e

and iAd

take twice and ten
times as long as Ad

, the efÞciency of LPOE and ADJ
approach should be comparable and much higher than the
D-H and POE approach, where the POE is the worst.
D. Structure clarity of error Jacobian matrix
Other than the aspects mentioned in the above, we would
also like to point out the following fact. Although the
ADJ approach takes slightly more Ad
(¥)
operations than the
LPOE approach, the structure clarity of the corresponding
error Jacobian matrix throws much light on the problem
of elimination of parametrization redundancy, identiÞability,
dealing with constraints, optimal selection of measurement
conÞgurations with different calibration indices. We have
achieved some exciting results and conclusions in some of
these issues, and will report them in the sequel to this paper.
V. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we have proposed a uniÞed geometric
framework for the comparison of robustness and efÞciency
of robot kinematic calibration algorithms. We proposed a
novel error modeling method along with a novel calibration
algorithm known as the Adjoint error algorithm. This algo-
rithm is essentially equivalent to ChenÕs local POE approach.
However, our new formulation offers a much deeper geo-
metric understanding, and also a natural way to eliminate
the redundancy in the parametrization. The elimination of
redundancy is essentially choosing an adaptive basis for the
complement of the joint subalgebra (Adjoint errors that Þx
the joint axis), where there is no strings attached to the choice
of the basis. In fact, any minimal parametrization boil down
to choosing a basis. In comparison, all other conventions
require at least two sets of 4 (2 for prismatic joint) minimal
parameters to achieve completeness. Those with more than
4 (2) parameters achieves parametric continuity when the
error basis together with the joint subalgebra generates the
whole twist spacese(3). The issue of redundancy elimination
becomes much clearer under our framework. Therefore, our
framework offers not only a reconciliation between major
kinematic modeling conventions, but also a uniÞed method
to consider the three rules of thumb for choosing appropriate
parametrization.
An efÞcient estimation of the algorithm efÞciency can
be achieved by counting the number of Adjoint maps and
integral Adjoint maps needed for the derivation of the error
Jacobian matrix, the latter being roughly twice slower than
the former. The POE and D-H algorithms should be much
slower than the local POE and Adjoint error algorithms.
To summarize the essential contribution of our work: our
geometric framework offers a test bed for any parametric
kinematic calibration algorithms, which can not only quickly
determine their efÞciency (by simply counting the number
of Adjoint maps and/or integral Adjoint maps), but also
analyze their pros and cons over parametrization issues,
identiÞability, imposing constraints, etc. The latter two, along
with other equally important issues are treated in the sequel
to this paper.
