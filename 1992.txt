Abstract—Since the cycling wheelchair was introduced in
the 2000s, we have focused on alleviating the over-use of
healthy limbs that presents a problem to users. To this end,
we have been developing assistance control for everyday users
of cycling wheelchairs. In our previous research, we found that
user load varies in different environments. Traveling resistance
compensation control proved successful in counteracting in
a range of environments. In the user-load investigation on
cycling wheelchairs, the crank torque generated by pedaling
was observed to be problematic for hemiplegic patients, who
must pedal mainly with their healthy side. Futhermore, for
patients able to bend one leg only, because the opposite limb is
stiffened at the knee joint or physically absent, the cycling
wheelchair is difﬁcult to maneuver. This paper focuses on
the crank torque during one-leg-pedaling and proposes a new
assistance control.
I. INTRODUCTION
Currently, individuals with lower-limb disabilities can ac-
cess a range of equipment such as wheelchairs, walkers, and
electric mobility devices. Daily use of such equipment may
leadtoover-useofhealthypartsanddisuseofdisabledparts.
For example, wheelchairs are popular mobility tools because
they are low-cost and can assist a wide range of patients
with lower-limb disabilities. However, persistent use of the
upper limbs to roll the wheelchair may eventually hurt the
joints. On the other hand, immobility of lower limbs may
cause “disuse syndrome” that threatens blood circulation.
Furthermore, because they must be rolled by both arms,
wheelchairs are not easilly maneuverable by hemiplegic
patients.
The cycling wheelchair originated from functional electri-
cal stimulation (FES) research [1]. Cycling wheelchair users
pedal with both legs. Despite the presumed difﬁculty of
disabled lower-limb patients pedaling with their legs, many
patients can successfully do so [2]. Cycling wheelchairs are
also beneﬁcial in rehabilitation, since the act of pedaling
increases the muscle activity of hemiplegic patients [3].
A top view and mechanical construction of the cycling
wheelchair are shown in Fig.1. The front pedals are con-
nected to the right wheel. The direction is controlled by
the steering wheel, operated by the hand lever. The cycling
wheelchair may be purchased from TESS Co. Ltd., Sendai,
Japan.
The cycling wheelchair provides a solution to the disuse
syndrome,andhasbeenusedtorehabilitatelower-limbpara-

Everyday users of the cycling-wheelchair encounter en-
vironmental problems as uphill slopes. Our previous re-
search investigated user load in various daily environments,
as perceived by lower-limb disabled subjects and healthy
control subjects. User load was observed to signiﬁcantly
vary in different environments; in paticular, environs that
are difﬁcult to negotiate increase the risk of accidents. In
addition, we found that hemiplegic patients pedal mainly
with their healthy side, thereby applying double force to that
side to compensate the disabled side. This asymmetry incurs
a risk of over-use of the healthy side [4].
To correct the environmental dependence on user load, we
previously equipped the cycling wheelchair with traveling
resistance compensation control. Such control successfully
canceledtheresistanceintroducedbycomplexenvironments.
This paper focuses on the latter part of the problem; that
of asymmetric pedaling by hemiplegic patients. For patients
with a single bendable leg, the cycling wheelchair is espe-
cially difﬁcult to maneuver.
We determine the pedaling characteristics by investigating
one-leg pedaling. We discuss crank torque during pedaling

and propose a new assistance control for one-leg pedaling.
Section 2 introduces related studies. The basic idea of the
proposed control is discussed in Section 3. The pedaling
characteristics which are important to develop assistance
control for one-leg-pedaling, are discussed in Section 4.
Sections 5 and 6 describe and test the assistance control
method, respectively.
II. RELATED STUDIES
The cycling wheelchair, and its daily use, has recently
featured in robotics and virtual reality studies. Hirata et al.
proposed a regenerative brake control with passive behavior
to assist braking a cycling wheelchair, for example when
it is on downhill incline, to prevent overspeed [5]. Hiro et
al. developed a measurement system for cycling wheelchairs
[6] in which environmental data are collected by a variety
of mounted sensors and motors. This system alerts the
user to pending unrecognized dangers such as obstacles and
pedestrians. Navigation and power support is also available
for traveling longer distance travel.
Sugitaetal.developedavirtualrealitysystemforcycling-
wheelchairs [7]. This virtual reality system is necessary
because users require large space for mastering the cycling
wheelcahir before entering everyday life. Driving skill in-
dices of the cycling wheelchair such as pedaling balance,
pedaling speed control, and handle steering were evaluated
in this system. Moreover, navigation skill was evaluated and
compared between young and elderly subjects in a scenario
of the virtual reality system [8].
Pedaling studies related to the current work have focused
on rehabilitation with functional electric stimulation (FES),
rehabilitation with ergometer, robotic pedaling, and power-
assisted cycling.
FES pedaling has been thoroughly researched because
pedaling is regarded as more efﬁcient at converting muscle
force to driving force than other locomotive activities such
as walking. Based on a dynamic musculo-skeletal mode,
Schutte et al. improved FES efﬁciency by ergometric op-
timization of seat conﬁgurations such as the recline angle of
the seat-back, orientation of the seat relative to gravity, and
distancebetweenthehipandcrankcenters[9].Gf¨ ohleretal.
developed an optimized stimulation pattern of FES based on
amodelofelectricallystimulatedmuscleandinvestigatedthe
correlation between muscle activity and pedaling rate [10].
In addition, they studied an alternative cycling design using
a freely-adjustable test bed and assessed the inﬂuence of
geometry and individual parameters on FES [11]. The above
researches have elucidated muscle stimulation patterns, opti-
mal geometric system conﬁgurations, and efﬁciency of FES
rehabilitation. Rosecrance et al. analyzed lower-limb move-
ment during ergometer pedaling and compared hemiplegics
and nonhemiplegics [12]. Brown et al. revealed that muscle
activity adapts to the anti-gravity posture during pedaling,
and that increased workload enhances force output by the
hemiplegic leg [13], [14]. Saitou et al. studied cerebral
blood volume and oxygenation during rehabilitation tasks
[15]. These studies focused on the effects of pedaling for
hemiplegic individuals and revealed the pedaling motion
used by hemiplegics. However, the rehabilitation workloads
used in these studies are constant during pedaling.
Inrobotics,Nakanishietal.realizedpedalingmotionsbya
self-trainedmusculo-skeletalhumanoidrobot[16].Kosugeet
al. proposed load-free power-assistance control for bicycles
[17]. This system compensates the drag force imposed by
the environment yielding the same riding experience as a
horizontal road. As mentioned above, pedaling has been
extensively researched. However, previously proposed sys-
tems for power assistance control have assumed bipedal
action and are not applicable to one-leg pedaling. To realize
assistance control for one-leg pedaling, we must characterize
thepedalingtorquethroughoutonecycleofone-legpedaling.
This paper discusses the characteristics of one-leg pedal-
ing obtained by a motor attached to a user-driven cycling
wheelchair. A new control algorithm for one-leg pedaling is
proposed.
III. CONCEPT OF THE PROPOSED ASSISTIVE CONTROL
METHOD FOR ONE LEG PEDALING
The basic idea of the proposed pedaling assistive control
system is to expand the basic power-assisted control consid-
eringpedalingcharacteristics.Inconventionalpower-assisted
control, the assistive torque is calculated by multiplying the
human torque input with a constant, as follows:
?
a
= Q?
input
, (1)
where?
input
istheinputtorquetothepedal,?
a
istheassistive
torque, and Q is the multiplying constant. This type of
power-assistedcontrolhasbeeneffectivelyusedforbicycles.
However, this control is not applicable to hemiplegic ped-
aling. Because for this control, the input is multiplied by a
constant,theunevenpedalingtorquepatternismagniﬁedthat
pedaling with the healthy leg becomes easier and pedaling
with the affected leg becomes yet more difﬁcult.
In our proposed method, we set a hypothesis that pedaling
input torque consists of human operating torque and gravity
effects of legs.
The concepts of our proposed control method are; (a)
to assist human operating torque instead of pedaling input
torque, and (b) to replace the multiplying constant Q with
a coefﬁcient function of angle of the crank ?, R
assist
(?), as
follows:

IV. CHARACTERISTICS OF ONE-LEG PEDALING

aling to verify the hypothesis that human pedaling motion

. During regions of positive ?
g
,
the simulated torque exceeds the measured torque because
the user succumbs to gravity. When ?
h
is small, each joint
torque is inefﬁciently converted, which impedes the onset of
pedaling.
We discuss assistance methods for one-leg pedaling with
the above characteristics. Assistance control for two-leg
pedaling is generally implemented by multiplying the crank
torque by a constant, as in power assisted bicycles. Our pre-
vious study demonstrated that pedaling with one leg placed
undue load on the healthy leg. However, when the pedaling
characteristics preclude easy application of the crank torque,
simply multiplying the assisting torque by a constant may
be insufﬁcient to initialize pedaling.
Assist torque can be determined from the pedaling char-
acteristics. If the pedal is in a difﬁcult position, assistance is
applied.Beforesupplyingtheassistancetorque,thedirection
in which the user wants to travel must be known. Hence, we
infer that the control must not only overcome the difﬁculty
of pedaling but also must know the user-desired direction
and magnitude of the assistance torque.
As discussed above, gravity contributes to the input ped-
aling torque. Thus gravitational effects must be removed
from the crank torque. In the proposing control method, the
operating torque ?
h
is assisted instead of net input torque
?
input
. In addition, the assistance ratio should not be constant
because the conversion efﬁciency depends on the angular
position of the pedal. Instead, we multiply the operating
torque ?
h
by a varying assistance ratio derived in the next
section.
V. ASSISTING CONTROL METHOD FOR ONE-LEG
PEDALING
This section introduces the proposed assistance control
method for one-leg pedaling. The operating crank torque is
assisted by a function of pedaling-assist-ratio. The operating
cranktorqueisobtainedbyremovinggravityeffectofhuman
leg from input crank torque. The gravity effect of human leg
on crank torque is obtained by Eq.(6)-(9).
The conversion of the input torque was discussed in
previous pedaling characteristics section. It showed how the
joint torque is converted to crank torque, however, it was
not enough because the constant joint torque had to be
given. Thus, we consider potential joint torque range to ﬁnd
potential input torque.

The joints are also affected by gravity on leg parts, such
that when the joint is moving towards the gravity, the joint
can exert as much more as the gravity effect of leg parts on
the joint. The gravity effect on each joints differ due to the
leg posture. The gravity effect on each joints are shown in
Fig.5. The gravity effect on each joints are included in the
potential joint torques.
Assuming that human can exert each maximum torques
independently, the image of the torque range of the leg is
shown in Fig.7(a). These torques are deﬁned positive in
ﬂexor direction of each joints. The force range on pedal is
calculated using virtual work principle,

Example results of one leg pedaling on planar ﬂoor are
shown in Fig. 13. The result with conventional control

the other hand it is small when input torque is small. In
contrast, result with proposed control provided large assist
torque when input torque is small. The assisting torque is

condition of the experiment, the velocity was kept around
the same. The smooth pedaling and controllability were also
reported from the participants.

is shown in Fig.14. As it was shown in the results samples,
the work is decreased in both environments.

This paper has presented and discussed the characteristics
of one-leg pedaling of a cycling wheelchair. The pedaling
motion involves human operating torque and gravity on
