On the Control of an Aerial Manipulator
Interacting with the Environment
Francesco Forte, Roberto Naldi, Alessandro Macchelli and Lorenzo Marconi
AbstractÑ This paper deals with the problem of modelling
and controlling an innovative aerial manipulator, i.e. a vertical
take-off and landing aircraft equipped with a fully-actuated
robotic arm. This system is able to perform complex operations
that require the physical interaction with the surrounding
environment while remaining airborne. Once a detailed dy-
namical model in the planar case is provided, a control law
able to govern all the degrees of freedom of the system is
discussed. Beside the methodological contribution that is easily
extendable to different combinations of UA Vs and robotic arms,
the effectiveness and main properties of the proposed control
algorithm are illustrated with the help of an experiment that
takes into account the case in which the manipulator is in
contact with the surrounding environment.
I. INTRODUCTION
In recent years, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UA Vs) have
become a popular research topic in the control and robotic
community, mostly driven by the particular application in
which such devices are employed, e.g. surveillance and data
acquisition in areas that are dangerous for humans and not
easily accessible to ground vehicles. Some of the most
investigated topics include coordination with other ground
and aerial vehicles [1], acrobatic ßight [2], localization and
reconstruction of unknown environments, [3]. On the other
hand, this paper focuses on a different applicative scenario,
namely the case in which the UA V is equipped with a
manipulator to be able to interact, in a safe and constructive
way, with the surrounding environment. The idea is to let the
system accomplish real robotic manipulation tasks, while the
UA V remains airborne. Among others, results on cooperative
transportation [4], grasping [5], [6] and the European funded
projects ARCAS [7] and AIRobots [8] are worth mentioning.
This latter, in particular, aims at developing aerial platforms
and control solutions speciÞcally tailored towards applica-
tions in which physical interaction is required. A number of
industrial applications, such as inspection of power plants,
wind turbines, big public infrastructures, etc., motivates the
interest towards this research direction.
In this work, the modeling and control of an innova-
tive aerial robot that consists of a Vertical Take-Off and
Landing (VTOL) airframe, more speciÞcally a ducted-fan
conÞguration [9], [10], [11], [12], and a fully-actuated2 d.o.f
This research has been conducted in part under the collaborative project
SHERPA supported by the European Community under the 7th Framework
Programme.

robotic arm with prismatic joints, and an end-effector, are
discussed. For its peculiar characteristics, the vehicle will be
denoted as aerial manipulator. By focusing on the planar
dynamics of the robot, the kinematical and dynamical model
are investigated with reference to a particular applicative
scenario that can be brießy described as follows. The human
operator moves the UA V in a desired position in space,
and then performs some inspection-by-contact tasks with the
manipulator while the position of the UA V is kept constant.
The environment is modeled as a vertical compliant surface.
The robot is then moved with respect to the ßoating base:
as a consequence, in this paper, the trajectory is directly
given in joint space, which is the analogous of the (rela-
tive) working space due to the particular geometry of the
manipulator. More complex mechanisms can be treated with
minimum modiÞcations. Since the UA V is under-actuated,
the challenge is to compensate the coupling forces with the
manipulator that appear either when the robot is moved in
free-space, and when the end-effector is in contact situations.
Inspired by classical vectored-thrust control for aerial robots
[13], [14] the idea is to take directly into account for
these coupling forces in the deÞnition of the desired force
control vector which is obtained by tilting the overall vehicle
in the desired direction while applying a certain thrust.
This approach naturally leads to a cascade control strategy
[15], [16] in which the position controller, which takes into
account all force components applied to the vehicle, plays
the role of the outer-loop generating an attitude reference for
the inner attitude loop.

II. DYNAMICAL MODEL OF THE AERIAL MANIPULATOR
A. Direct and differential kinematics of the aerial manipu-
lator structure
The Þrst step in modeling the robot consists in the def-
inition of the forward kinematics. First of all, in order to
make the paper readable, the following notation (related to
the sketch in Fig. 1) is introduced:
¥ F
i
:= {O
i
, i
i
, j
i
}, F
b
:= {O
b
, i

}, F
m
:=
{O

m
, j
m
}, and F
e
:= {O
e
, i
e
, j
e
} represent the
inertial reference frame, the reference frame attached to
the center of gravity (c.g.) of the UA V , the reference
frame attached to the Þrst link of the manipulator and
Þnally, the reference frame attached to the end-effector,
respectively;
¥ h
b
:= [0,?h]
T
, r
b
:= [r, 0]
T
, and c
b
:= [0,?c]
T
are
three vectors of parameters expressed in the body frame
F
b
that represent the vertical and lateral displacements
of the base plate of the prismatic manipulator with
respect to the c.g., the distance between the c.g. and
the application point of the ßapÕs force F , while ø x
i
:=
[ø x, 0]
T
is the position of the contact surface with respect
to the inertial frame;
¥ p
i
b
:= [x, y]
T
represents the position ofO
b
with respect
toO
i
, namely the position of the UA V expressed in the
inertial reference frame;
¥ p
b
m
:= [r, d
m
?h]
T
is the position ofO
m
with respect
to O
b
, while p
m
e
:= [d
e
, 0]
T
represents the position of
O
e
with respect to O
m
;
¥ ? is the attitude of the UA V;
¥ q := [x, y, ?, d
m
, d
e
]
T
denotes the vector containing
the ÒjointÓ variables of the overall robot, i.e. UA V and
manipulator;
¥ u := [T, F, f
m
, f
e
]
T
is the vector containing all actu-
ation forces of the overall robot, i. e. T is the propeller
force,F is the ßapÕs force, whilef
m
andf
e
are the two
forces acting on the manipulator.
The direct cinematic is easily computed by starting from
the following three homogeneous transformations:

#
having in mind that the generic matrix A
k
j
describes the co-
ordinate transformation of an applied vector from a reference
frame F
j
to another F
k
. As far as the construction of the
dynamic model is concerned, it is important to compute the
position of the originO
m
with respect to the inertial frame,
i.e. p
i
m
, and the position of the end-effector with respect to
the same frame, i.e. p
i
e
. It can be easily obtained that

Finally, the Jacobian matrix J(q) of the entire manipulator
is determined by simply differentiating the direct kinematics
equations:
J(q) :=

?

1 0 ?S

(d

(2)
The Jacobian matrix is fundamental for analyzing the physi-
cal interaction between aerial manipulator and environment.
In fact, it is well-known that J(q) is not only involved in the
relation between joint and end-effector velocities, but also in
the static relation, between joint and external forces/torques
applied to the end-effector.

B. Model of the aerial manipulator in free ßight & interac-
tion scenario
The dynamical model of the system under investigation
has been computed thanks to classical Lagrangian arguments.
In particular, let us deÞne the Lagrangian of the system
as L(q, ú q) := T (q, ú q)?U(q), with T and U the kinetic
and potential energy respectively. In compact form, the
Lagrangian equations are given by
d

while D is a diagonal matrix with the viscous friction
coefÞcients.
The total kinetic energy is the sum of two contribution
(i.e., the UA V with mass M and moment of inertia J
uav
,
and the manipulator with mass and moment of inertia of
the Þrst and second joint, supposed to be equal and given
by m

effector given bym

As depicted in Figure 1, the end-effector installed on the
planar aerial manipulator may come into contact with the
environment, modeled as a vertical compliant surface located
at the position ø x with respect to the inertial reference frame
F
i
. When the lateral positionx
i
e
of the end-effector is greater
or equal than the position of the vertical surface, the envi-
ronment applies to the end-effector a force f
c
directed along
the inertial x axis. Compliant contact models, such as Hunt-
Crossley or Kelvin-V oight [17], can be employed to model
the forcef
c
as a function of the mechanical characteristics of
the contacts materia. In this case, to complete the description
of the full order model, we deÞne h
e
(q) := [f
c
, 0, 0]
T
.
C. Approximated dynamic model in the interaction scenario
As far as the manipulator is concerned, by assuming that
the mass of the two links is negligible compared to the one
of the end effector (i.e. m
m
 m
e
:= m), the following
approximated dynamical model can be obtained:
m

¬
d
m
#
=
"
f
e
f
m
#
?R
T
(?)
"
f
c
mg
#
. (4)
Note that the two joint positions are driven by the control
forces f
e
and f
m
, and are affected by the force f
c
applied
by the environment, and by the attitude ? of the vehicle.
The second subsystem is the dynamical model of the UA V
that is driven by the thrust T and the torque ? := F c.
By assuming that the mass of the manipulator is negligible
compared to the one of the vehicle, namely mM (in our
set-upM Å 1.8kg, mÅ 0.1kg), the lateral and longitudinal
dynamics can be approximated as
M

=?R(?)
"
f
e
f

#

#

(5)
while the attitude dynamics are governed by
J
uav
¬
? =? +(d
m
?h)f
e
?(r +d
e
)f
m
. (6)
Note that the lateral, the vertical and the attitude dynamics
of the aerial vehicle are affected by the two forces f
e
and
f
m
governing the manipulator.
Remark. In (5), the effect of the aerodynamic force F on
the position dynamics of the vehicle has been omitted. This
effect is often denoted as small body force in literature and
it is a distinguishing feature of some VTOL conÞgurations,
including ducted-fan and helicopters [18]. In the analysis
proposed in this work, their effect has been neglected. In fact,
for a miniature system in which the inertia is characterized
by small values [19], large angular accelerations are achieved
with small values of F . /
III. THE ROBUST CONTROL OF THE AERIAL
MANIPULATOR
A. The Control Problem
The control problem tackled in this paper deals with the
stabilization of the complete system when the manipulator
tracks a desired trajectory deÞned, for simplicity, in the joint
space. Furthermore, the control law has to be robust with
respect to external non-modeled forces that are applied on
the end-effector in case of interaction with the environment.
Differently than in [20], the control algorithm has been
developed without necessarily relying on the impedance
control paradigm. In fact, as far as the control of the robotic
arm is concerned, it is required that joint control actions
f
m
and f
e
remain bounded in the presence of the external
contact force f
c
. This topic is discussed in Sect. III-B.
Either in case of free-ßight and interaction with the
environment condition, the coupling between manipulator
and UA V takes place via the couple of (joint) forces f
m
and f
e
. The control of the UA V is developed in order to
keep a constant position in space, and to compensate for the
disturbance forces due to coupling. This is achieved thanks
4489
to a modiÞed vector control strategy proposed in Sect. III-
C. The idea is to deÞne a control vector that considers the
presence of the known forces f
m
and f
e
, so as to determine
the thrust and the reference orientation required to maintain
the desired conÞguration.
B. Robust Control of the Robotic Arm
Let d
?
e
(t) and d

the manipulator joint variables, and consider the following

The Þrst item in the above proposition shows how the
manipulator control forces f
e
, f
m
are bounded functions
of time. The bound does not depend on the magnitude of
the contact force f
c
, thanks to the nested saturation control
design introduced in (8). This property can be regarded
as the disturbance response of the manipulator closed-loop
system [21]. The second item is showing how the Þrst order
derivative of the feedback control law can be bounded by
a value that does not depend on the current tracking error
and its derivatives. This bound will be taken into account
in the next section where the interconnection between the
manipulator and the aerial platform is considered. Finally,
the third item shows how, in the presence of the exogenous
disturbancef
c
, practical tracking of the desired trajectoryd

is achieved. In the special case in which f

is vanishing
asymptotically, such as during free-ßight maneuvers, the
tracking becomes asymptotic.
C. ModiÞed Thrust-Vectoring Control of the UAV
Let x
?
and y
?
denote the constant lateral and vertical
desired positions of the center of gravity of the aerial vehicle.
To stabilize the aerial platform in the desired conÞguration,
we deÞne the following control vector

The control vectorv

dynamics (5) by properly vectorizing the thrust produced by
the propeller. More speciÞcally, we compute a control thrust

The above relation can be separated into two parts, one

obtain

To compute a solution to (13)-(14) we consider the following

While the control thrust T

employed as a reference for the attitude stabilizing control

here is the fact that the reaction forces applied by the
manipulator back to the aerial platform are directly taken into
account in the deÞnition of the desired control force vector
(see Figure 2). This fact allows the vehicle to stabilize, in
the sense that will be speciÞed in the following, a constant

The result in the above proposition is showing how the
aerial vehicle dynamics remain bounded in the presence of
the reaction forces applied by the manipulator. The effect of
these disturbances can be arbitrarily reduced by increasing
the gain of the attitude control loop. Note that the exogenous
disturbance include also the unknown contact force f
c
,
showing the effectiveness of the proposed design in tasks
requiring physical interaction.
IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
The purpose of this section is to validate all the previous
theory, presented in Section III, showing some results ob-
tained by carrying out a series of experiments. The overall
Aerial Manipulator (see Fig. 3) consists in a Ducted Fan
prototype rigidly connected to the base plate of a parallel
Delta robot. In Table I are listed the main mechanical
parameters of the structure according to the approximated
dynamical model shown in Section II-C, while in Table II,
are listed the control parameters employed in the control laws
(8)-(9)-(17)-(18)-(22).
By referring to the following Figure 4, it is possible to
notice the behavior of the UA V during two different phases
composing the experiment: the Þrst one, is the Free Flight
(that happens approximately from 70s toÅ 105s) in which
the vehicle tracks in a good way the reference trajectories
until the vertical surface; the second phase, that is the
Docking/Contact phase, begins after Å 105s, recognizable
by observing the lateral position x that does not follow
the right trajectory because of the presence of the obstacle.
Furthermore, at the same time, the UA V tilts since the ?
dynamics is directly inßuenced by the lateral error. The
contact force also affects the vertical dynamics of the vehicle,
as a small tracking error can be observed also for the vertical
position y.

V. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE ACTIVITIES
In this work, the model and the control of an aerial
manipulator, namely a ducted-fan aerial robot equipped with
a fully-actuated robotic arm, able to accomplish operations
requiring the physical interaction with the surrounding en-
vironment is presented. A control law, able to stabilize
the system both in the free ßight and in the presence of
contacts, is discussed. Furthermore, the regulator is robust
in the sense that it does not require the knowledge of
the environment, neither the measurement of the interaction
forces. Experiments show how docking to a surface can be
achieved. Future activities deal with the extension of the
proposed approach to the three-dimensional case.
