AbstractÑIn this paper a control strategy for a mobile robot
enabling to track a manually driven vehicle or a moving target
is proposed in the context of natural environment. In such a
context, the motion does not meet classical assumptions usually
proposed for mobile robots, since the terrain geometry is not
necessarily ßat and wheels are subject to sliding. As a result, in
order to preserve the accuracy of tracking, it appears necessary
to account for such phenomena in the control law. Several
observer-based approaches have already been developed in the
framework of path following in off-road conditions, but suffer
from several limitations. In particular, the velocity should not
be null, which appears to be an important drawback in the
proposed application: the tracking of a non-autonomous vehicle
indeed imposes possible stops. In this paper, a new observation
strategy is proposed allowing to avoid non-observable situations
(null velocity). This permits to achieve an accurate vehicle
tracking whatever its velocity, its trajectory and the grip
conditions.
I. INTRODUCTION
Several off-road applications require to control a vehicle
with a high accuracy level in harsh conditions. From defense
to agriculture, the driving task in natural environment has to
be addressed. Such a task may be difÞcult, painful, or dan-
gerous for human drivers. The development of autonomous
or semi-autonomous mobile robots may then be of interest
to achieve surveillance, transportation or agriculture treat-
ment [2]. For instance, the tracking of a moving target (such
as a manually driven vehicle) may increase the efÞciency of
the task achieved, while still letting the leading role to the
human. Path following or target tracking have been deeply
theoretically studied for several types of mobile robots [7],
based on an ideal modeling (rolling without sliding) of the
robot motion [3]. This leads to satisfactory results when
moving on urban ground at low speed, but appears to be
inaccurate when achieving motions on slippery ground [5].
As a consequence, for high accurate motion servoing in
natural environments or in harsh conditions, robust control
with respect to low and varying grip conditions has to
be developed. Several approaches have been proposed in
the framework of path following, considering sliding as a
perturbation to be rejected [1], and relying for instance
on sliding mode control techniques [6]. These approaches
avoid the modeling of grip conditions, but may appear
to be conservative. Model-based adaptive approaches have
also been previously proposed [4], considering an extended
kinematic model. Nevertheless, an observability condition
imposes a strictly positive velocity for the estimation of
sideslip angles, representative of sliding effects. If it is a
basic assumption in the path following task, the moving
object tracking application may in contrast require to stop
the robot, as the target does. The observer has then to be
frozen when the speed is below a given threshold, leading
to chattering effects or initialization troubles when the robot
restarts, as it is highlighted in the following.
In this paper, a new adaptive approach is proposed
1
. It per-
mits an on-line estimation of sideslip angles independently
from the robot velocity. As a consequence, the extended
modelcanalwaysbeproperlyadaptedinordertoaccountfor
sliding effects and their variation. Control is then designed to
follow the trajectory of a moving object at a certain distance
with a possible desired lateral offset. Since a kinematic
structure of the adapted model is preserved, the lateral and
longitudinal motions of the mobile robot are considered
independently. A velocity control law is Þrst derived to
ensure a desired curvilinear distance to the target. A steering
angle law is then deÞned, based on the exact linearization of
the model to ensure an accurate tracking error with respect
to the desired lateral distance to the trajectory.
The paper is decomposed as follows. First, the extended
model is recalled from previous work, in the framework
of target tracking. In a second part, the proposed observer
is detailed, allowing an accurate description of the robot
motion. As a relevant model is then available, the velocity
and steering angle control laws are detailed in a third part.
The efÞciency of the approach, and the effective contribu-
tions of the paper are then investigated through full scale
experiments.

mobile robot, with a desired relative position (curvilinear
distance and lateral offset). In this paper, the mobile robot is
a car-like vehicle, considered as a bicycle (such as depicted
in Figure 1). Since the objective is the tracking of the Þrst
vehicle trajectory (the successive points of the leader are
approximated by second order polynomials), the motion of
the robot is referred to this trajectory denoted ?. Based on
this assumption, the state variables for the robot are:
¥ therobotcurvilinearabscissasalong ?.Itrepresentsthe
curvilinear distance between the initial leaderÕs position
and the closest point belonging to ? from point O,
middle of the robot rear axle. Similarly, s
L
is the
curvilinear abscissa of the leader, equal to the distance
it has travelled.
¥ the robot tracking error y, which is the lateral deviation
between the robot position (centre of the rear axle O)
and the closest point to O belonging to ? (denoted by
the curvilinear abscissa s).
¥ the robot angular deviation
÷
?, which is the difference
between absolute robot heading and the orientation of
tangent to ? at s.
This type of model is commonly used in the framework
of mobile robotics [9], but generally assume that the robot
wheels satisfy rolling without sliding conditions. The off-
road context addressed in this paper does not satisfy such
conditions, and the accuracy is depreciated when using a
control based on such a model in natural environment.
In order to account for non-ideal grip conditions in mo-
Fig. 1. Model of formation motion with one vehicle and one mobile robot
tion model, without considering the numerous parameters
required by a dynamical model, two additive variables ?
F
and ?
R
(for front and rear axle) are introduced, see Figure 1.
Named as sideslip angles, they are representative of the
angles between tire orientation and actual speed vector
orientation at contact points and permit to account for the
inßuence of sliding.
B. Motion equations
The robot motion is achieved thanks to the control
variables v (the vehicle velocity at point O) and ? (the
front steering angle). Considering the actual speed vectors
(accounting for sideslip angles) and with L denoting the
robot wheelbase, the derivative of the state variables may be
computed similarly to classical kinematic models (see [4])
and leads to:

1?c(s)y6= 0. This means that the point O (center of rear
axle) is not superimposed with the center of ? ats. This case
is never encountered in practice, assuming that the robot is
properly initialized.
III. SIDESLIP ANGLES ESTIMATION
A. Observer equations
In order to derive control laws for path following and
distance servoing based on the model (1), the knowledge
of relevant values for sideslip angles ?
F
and ?
R
is manda-
tory. Since there is no available sensor enabling the direct
measurement of such variables, an indirect estimation has to
be achieved. As pointed out in [4], if a measurement of the
vector [s,y,
÷
?] is available (quite standard in mobile robot
applications), then the sideslip angles are observable from
model (1) and an indirect measurement algorithm, based
on the duality between observation and control, has been
proposed. Nevertheless, such an observer, named Control
Based Observer (CBO) in the sequel, involves a division by
the robot velocity, thus bringing to a singularity if the robot
stops. Since only path following was previously addressed,
the robot velocity was not supposed to be small, and if
for any reason the robot velocity decreased below some
threshold (0.5m.s
?1
), the estimation process was stopped
and reinitialized when the robot was restarting. However, if
manuallydrivenvehicletrackingisnowconsidered,potential
stops or slow motions have to be considered and CBO
observer may then lead to inaccuracies (as pointed out in
results section). A new observation strategy is then proposed
in this paper, using an adaptation law without any restriction
on the robot velocity.
In order to proceed the indirect estimation of sideslip
angles, let us consider the state space model (2)

where ? is split into two sub-states:

by the leading vehicle).
¥ ?

T
, which is composed of the sideslip
angles, to be estimated.
In state space model (2), f(?
dev
,?
?
,v,?) is deduced directly
from the two last lines of model (1). In this formalism,
only ?
dev
is supposed to be measured and the objective is
2653
to Þnd an observed state
ö
? which converges to the actual
one ?, thanks to the observation error on the ÒdeviationÓ
part
÷
?
dev
= ?

?
ö
?
dev
. The sub-state
ö
?
?
thus obtained can
then be regarded as a relevant estimation of sideslip angles.
Since there is no equation attached to sideslip angles
evolution, the observer is also separated into two sub-states.
It has then the general form :
?
?
?

(3)
where ?
dev
and ?
?
are functions of the observation error
attached to the deviation part of the state ?. Only the
observation error attached to robot deviation may indeed be
known, while the sideslip angles observation error, denoted
hereafter
÷
?
?

?
?
ö
?
?
, cannot be evaluated. As a result,
the function f used in observer (3) takes as parameters the
actual (i.e. measured) sub-state ?
dev
but only the estimated
sideslip angles
ö
?
?
.
The objective is then to Þnd functions ?
dev
and ?
?
allowing the convergence of both
÷
?
dev
and
÷
?

to zero. The
observation error dynamics indeed depends on these two
functions as their expressions are:

and the quantity in (12) cannot be null since angular devi-

. As
a result, sideslip angles estimation

obtained thanks to the
observer (3) and the functions (7) converges to the unknown
actual sideslip angles without direct measurement and can
then be used for control purpose.
IV. CONTROL LAW
As soon as a relevant estimation of the sideslip angles
?
F
and ?
R
is available, the motion model (1) is fully
known and a control law may consequently be proposed,
accounting for bad grip conditions. The proposed control
approach independently considers lateral and longitudinal
dynamics. This is made possible thanks to a preliminary
conversion of model (1) into a chained form.
A. Lateral dynamic control [steering angle]
Let us Þrst consider the lateral servoing. The objective is
to Þnd a steering angle control law ensuring the convergence
of the angular deviation y to some set point function y
d
(t)
(i.e. the desired lateral offset may be time-varying). As it
has been demonstrated in [8], the model (1) may be turned
into a chained form using the state and control reversible
transformation (13).

Moreover, in order to obtain a closed loop behavior indepen-
dent from velocity v, the derivatives with respect to time are
replaced in the following by derivatives with respect to the
curvilinear abscissa s. Let us denote by a
?
i
, i ? {1,2,3} the
derivative of variable a
i
with respect to curvilinear abscissa:
a
?

(14)
The motion model (14) is linear, the Þrst state variable a

is
directly the lateral deviation y and the control variable m

is
related to the steering angle ?. The objective then becomes
to ensure the convergence of a

to any set point function

The reverse of transformation (13) Þnally permits to Þnd the

As a result, as soon as sideslip angles are correctly known,
the convergence of ?
y
to 0 is imposed by the steering
angle with a settling distance deÞned by the gains (K

whatever the velocity.

The longitudinal servoing aims to impose a possibly vary-

This shows the exponential convergence of the curvilinear

is properly initialized. Since the lateral behavior has been
made independent from the velocity thanks to derivatives
with respect to the curvilinear abscissa, the control laws (17)
for the steering angle and (19) for the velocity can achieve
the tracking of a manually driven vehicle in lateral and
longitudinal axis independently.
V. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
A. Experimental testbed
The proposed adaptive control strategy, relying on a robust
estimation of grip conditions, has been tested through full
scale experiments using the two mobile robots depicted in
Figure 2. Both are electrical, four wheel drive and equipped
withtwoindependentsteeringaxles(frontandrear).Theyare
able to move up to 4 m.s
?1
. In the framework of this paper,
only the second robot is autonomously controlled with the
laws (17) and (19), respectively for the front steering wheels
and the velocity (the rear steering actuator is here unused).
TheÞrstrobotisremotelycontrolled.However,anymanually
driven vehicle could have be used instead, provided that it is
able to know its successive positions and send them to the
autonomous follower.
Both vehicles are then equipped with RTK-GPS, settled
Fig. 2. Experimental platform
straight up the middle of the rear axle, providing a 2cm-
accuracy at 10Hz. They are linked by wireless communi-
cation. The follower may then access in real time to the
successive positions of the Þrst vehicle (constituting the ?
path) and to its velocity v
L
. Together with its own location,
all the state may be known in the Fr« enet frame: [s,y,
÷
?].
B. Observer results
As one of the main contributions of this paper lies in a
new observer for sideslip angles, robust at low speed, let us
Þrst consider the tracking of the path depicted in Figure 3,
with a deÞned velocity proÞle crossing zero. In order to
2655
allow the analysis of observer capabilities, this path has been
followed three times with the same robot, in three different
conÞgurations:
1. Using rolling without sliding assumption: in this case
(
ö
?
F
,
ö
?
R
) = (0,0) in the control laws, reßecting the
classical assumption used in mobile robot control. Re-
sults related to this trial are depicted with blue plain
line in the following Þgures
2. Using the CBO observer, previously developed for path
following control [4]. As mentioned in section III-A,
the inverse of the velocity is used in observer equations.
Consequently, in order to enable the robot to stop, this
observer is stopped below 0.5m.s
?1
. In addition, in
order to avoid inconsistent values when the observer is
restarted, a Butterworth Þlter has been set on estimated
sideslip angles. Results are shown in blue dashed line
in the following.
3. Using the observer (3) proposed in this paper, fed back
with the functions (7). Results appear in green dashed-
dotted line in forthcoming Þgures.
Fig. 3. Reference path and actual trajectories comparison
The reference path ? shown in black line in Figure 3 has
been recorded partially on a sloping Þeld and partially on
a ßat ground (both on grass ground). It is composed of a
long straight line with a lateral inclination followed by a
long curve and several successive turns. The desired velocity
proÞle is constant (equal to 3m.s
?1
) except at the stop point,
where a step at a null velocity is imposed during 5s (an
illustrating video of trial 3 has been submitted with this
paper). The desired lateral deviation also stays constant and
equal to zero.
Trajectories obtained during the 3 trials are reported in
Fig. 4. Comparison of tracking errors
Figure 3, while the tracking errors are compared in Figure 4.
First,duringthestraightlineonslope,thebadgripconditions
at the considered speed make the robot drifts. As a result,
whenslidingisneglected,thecontrollawcannotpreservethe
accuracy and the robot lateral deviation converges to 0.5m
(asconditionsareroughlyconstant,uptocurvilinearabscissa
40m). After the stopping period (at 40m), the robot tracking
error increases during the acceleration (up to 0.8m at 50m)
and the robot is only able to come back to the trajectory
when the lateral inclination reaches zero (at 65m). The
same phenomenon may be noticed during important curves
(principally at 78m here, where the error reaches 0.65m), as
turning rate generates sliding effects too. In contrast, when
sideslipanglesareconsidered(trial2and3),therobotisable
to stay on the desired trajectory despite the sliding effects
encountered when moving on slope (errors reach zero before
and after 40m).
Nevertheless, error dynamics are slightly different during
the slope. Before the stop point (at 40m), the previous
sideslip angles estimation method is indeed less stable and
some oscillations appear during trial 2, while the error stays
close to zero during trial 3. However, the main inßuence of
the estimation strategy on the robot control may be observed
when stopping the robot. When using the observer deÞned
in [4], the sideslip angles are irrelevant at low speed (due
to the division by the velocity) and an important deviation
is noticed when the robot is restarted (1.2m at curvilinear
abscissa 50m). On the contrary, the performances of the
proposed observer are not depreciated at low speeds. As a
result, the tracking accuracy is preserved whatever the speed
and always stays within±15cm.
Fig. 5. Comparison of sideslip observation strategy
Figure 4 compares the sideslip angles observed with the
proposed strategy to the values supplied by the CBO during
the same trial 3. When the robot restarts (at 40m), since the
velocity is low and the measurements are noisy, and despite
the use of a Butterworth Þlter, the CBO observer may deliver
inconsistent large values for the sideslip angles, as it can be
noticedinFigure4.Onthecontrary,theobserverfunction(7)
is able to supply relevant values when the velocity is close
to zero. This explains the difference in tracking errors at
40m between trials 2 and 3. In contrast, when the velocity
is signiÞcantly different from 0 (and after stabilization),
behaviors are quite similar.
C. Autonomous tracking of a manually driven vehicle
Contrarily to conventional approaches, the proposed con-
trol strategy permits to account for bad grip conditions
encountered in off-road context, without any restriction on

velocity. As a result, it can be used for tracking a moving
target atadesireddistance and achieving any motion, includ-
ing being stopped. In order to demonstrate these capabilities,
the control laws (17) and (19) have been used in the
conÞguration depicted in Figure 2, with a null desired lateral
offset (i.e. y
d
(t) = 0) and a 8m longitudinal distance (i.e.
d(t) = 8).

Fig. 7. Lateral and longitudinal error recorded during leader tracking
longitudinal distances are quite accurate after a 15m settling
distance. Since the proposed observer is robust with respect
to the velocity variations, the lateral error is not affected by
the stop points at 85m and 95m. Despite bad grip conditions
(the robot moves on wet grass, on the terrain depicted in
Figure 2), only small overshoots are recorded at 35m and
75m, when short but quick curves are to be tracked. These
overshoots are mainly due to the neglected settling time of
the steering actuator. For the same reason, some overshoots
are also recorded in the longitudinal error at curvilinear
absciss¾ 58m, 85m and 95m. They are mainly due to the
fast variations in the speed of the manually driven vehicle.
In particular, the two stop points are not anticipated by the
follower and the settling time in the wheel engines generates
these two deviations.
VI. CONCLUSION
This paper proposes a control strategy in order to track a
moving target with a mobile robot in an off-road context.
In this framework, the bad grip conditions together with
the target motion and the terrain geometry do not permit to
use classical assumptions such as rolling without sliding. A
model-based adaptive approach is here proposed in order to
estimate on-line and compensate for the inßuence of sliding
effects on the robot behavior. The adaptation law proposed
in this paper is not subject to any existence conditions
related to the robot velocity. This original point permits to
achieve a relevant estimation of the sideslip angles, even
when the robot has to stop. As a consequence, an on-line
adapted model preserving a kinematic structure is available.
It permits to derive independently control laws dedicated to
longitudinal and lateral dynamics, acting respectively on the
velocity and the steering angle of the robot. As it is pointed
out thanks to actual experiments, such a control strategy
permits to preserve a high level of accuracy, with respect to
disturbing phenomena encountered in natural environments.
In particular, the errors encountered when neglecting sliding,
occurring mainly during slope or bends are compensated,
even when robot has to stop and restart.
As it can be seen on actual tracking results, the accuracy
maybedepreciatedduringfasttransitions(velocityvariations
from longitudinal point of view and turning radius modiÞ-
cations from lateral point of view). As it can be checked on
simulations, this is mainly due to the neglected settling time
and delays of the actuators. If the errors are not signiÞcant
at low speed, the tracking at higher speed may increase such
phenomena. Future work is focused on the integration of
predictive algorithm to anticipate for delays and preserve the
accuracy even when robot may be subjected to large velocity
variations.
