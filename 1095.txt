Natural Redundancy Resolution in Dual-Arm Manipulation using
Conﬁguration Dependent Stiffness (CDS) Control
Arash Ajoudani, Nikos G. Tsagarakis, Jinoh Lee, Marco Gabiccini and Antonio Bicchi
Abstract— Incorporation of human motor control principles
in the motion control architectures for humanoid robots or
assistive and prosthesis devices will permit these systems not
only to look anthropomorphic and natural at the body ware
level but also to generate natural motion proﬁles resembling
those executed by humans during manipulation and locomotion.
In this work, relying on the observations on human bimanual
coordination, a novel realtime motion control strategy is pro-
posed to regulate the desired Cartesian stiffness proﬁle during
the execution of bimanual tasks. The novelty of the proposed
control scheme relies on the use of common mode stiffness
(CMS) and conﬁguration dependent stiffness (CDS) to regulate
the size and directionality of the task space stiffness ellipsoid.
Thanks to the CDS control, the proposed scheme is not only
proved to be effective in regulating the desired stiffness ellipsoid
but also permits to resolve the manipulator redundancy in a
natural manner. The effectiveness of the controller is evaluated
in an experimental setup in which two cooperating robotic
arms are executing an assembly task. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed dual-arm CDS-CMS controller
is effective in tracking the desired stiffness ellipsoids as well as
in producing human-like natural motions for the two robotic
arms.
I. INTRODUCTION
In recent years, the fast growing interest in versatility and
ﬂexibility of robotic systems working closely and interacting
with humans in co-operative tasks or acting as assisting or
prosthesis systems had led to the development of a wide
range of systems: from full body humanoid robot co-workers
to anthropomorphic manipulator prosthesis and exoskeleton
systems aiming to aid and improve the life of humans with
special needs. Apart from resembling the human body in
terms of kinematics and physical appearance, and to increase
their acceptability and compatibility, such systems should be
also capable of generating motions that look natural and
demonstrate similarities with those executed by humans.
To achieve this, it is proﬁtable therefore to incorporate in
the motion control architecture of these systems human
principles of motor control [1].
The goal is to obtain a good performance, while rendering
a human-like natural motion, which is deemed to emerge
as a consequence of the stabilization of some task-related
criteria. To illustrate the underlying concept, examples of
natural postures of the human while holding a cup or using

a screwdriver are depicted in Fig. 1. A and B, respectively.
In these particular examples, subtask criteria are rooted
in the concepts of minimum effort (1. A) and impedance
control (1. B), which lead to the generation of corresponding
conﬁgurations. Inspired by similar observations, the problem
of redundancy resolution has been extensively addressed in
the ﬁeld of robotics by establishing task-related artiﬁcial
potential ﬁelds [2], [3], [4], while, only few studies have
drawn attention to the acquired human-like natural motion
[5], [1], [6].
With the advent of higher demands on dual-arm mani-
pulation, interaction with the environment using impedance
control [7] became the focus of many studies in dual-arm
systems. In this direction, object-level impedance control
of cooperating robots has gained great attention due to the
feasibility of controlling task forces/velocities while avoiding
the occurrence of high internal forces [8]. In [9], an internal
force based impedance controller has been proposed and
its effectiveness was evaluated in an assembly task in a
planar setup. Following that, Bonitz et al. [10] extended the
aforementioned concept to a condition in which the dynamics
of the object is not known. In [11], a decentralized impedance
controller is proposed and its contact efﬁciency is evaluated
in an industrial setup, in which two cooperating manipulators
carry a common object. The authors in [12], [8] have presen-
ted object-level impedance controllers with coupling stiffness
which is deﬁned by a potential function. Even though such
well-established techniques have successfully demonstrated
their effectiveness through reliable handling of the contact,
only few have highlighted the efﬁciency of the Cartesian
impedance control through redundancy resolution [13], [14].

In this paper, relying on the major contribution of the
arm conﬁguration to effectively regulate the directionality
of the realized endpoint stiffness ellipsoid, and its low-cost
nature [15], [16], [17], we explore the role of conﬁguration
dependent stiffness (CDS) control [18], for dual-arm object
manipulation. Therefore, the joint variables are controlled in
redundant space to realize a task-speciﬁc Cartesian stiffness
proﬁle. In addition, with the purpose of obtaining a good
tracking performance while rendering natural movements, we
incorporate the optimality principles in human motor control
in the development of proposed impedance controller. In this
direction, given the growing body of evidence in support of
coordinated stiffening behavior of the arm joints in humans
(e.g. see [19], [15], [16]), we utilize the concept of common
mode stiffness (CMS) control. To establish this concept, we
assume a correlated stiffening behavior among the joints
of each robot. A realtime optimization technique is then
proposed to adjust the CMS and CDS variables and realize a
desired Cartesian stiffness proﬁle of the tool, w.r.t the object:
While the CMS variations contribute to the modiﬁcations
of the size of the realized stiffness ellipsoid (analogous to
the role of co-contractions in human arm), CDS control
will orient the realized stiffness ellipsoid toward the desired
Cartesian proﬁle.
The effectiveness of the proposed controller is evaluated
in a dual-arm assembly task. The acquired good tracking
performance and similarities between the natural postures
of the human operators and the ones realized by the robots
illustrate the contact efﬁciency of the proposed algorithm,
while highlighting the advantages of the integration of hu-
man motor principles in redundancy resolution of dual-arm
manipulation. Therefore, utilization of similar motion control
strategies in humanoids co-operating with humans or upper
limb assistive exoskeleton or prosthesis devices can result
in the generation of more natural motions improving the
acceptability and compatibility of such devices.
The rest of the paper is structured as follows; section II
describes the development of the proposed controller. The
experimental setup and results of the implementation of the
controller for a dual-arm assembly task are presented in
sections III and IV , respectively. Finally, section V addresses
the conclusions.
II. CONTROLLER DESIGN
A. Dual-arm kinematics
Observations on human bimanual coordination suggest
that the central nervous system (CNS) stabilizes the ﬁrst
synergy of the two cooperating arms to a larger degree
(higher control levels) than if it did for control of each arm
joints, separately. Indeed, as regards the human dual-arm
activities in its most natural way, two hands cooperate in
a way that they form a kinematic chain [20]: while the ﬁrst
synergy stabilizes the relative position/orientation of the two
hands (as a dominant task requirement), lower hierarchical
levels of control stabilize remaining task variables by con-
trolling the redundant degrees of freedom [21], [22]. Above
observations promote the idea of utilizing a similar kinematic

representation in dual-arm robotic manipulation of the object
to accommodate the stabilization of the task variables as well
as rendering a natural redundancy resolution.
To that end, in our setup, a relative Jacobian is used which
creates a uniﬁed, coordinated control between the two arms.
Normally, the expression of the relative Jacobian combines
the individual Jacobians of each arm, such that the resulting
Jacobian maps the joint velocities of the two arms to the
relative velocity between the end-effectors [23]. This allows
users to directly specify the relative trajectory between the
two end-effectors such that coordinating the trajectories of
the two arms becomes an easy task. Such representation
have been incorporated with force-guided control [24] and
impedance control [25] as well.
The dual-arm manipulation setup is shown in ﬁgure (2).

we assume that manipulator A is rigidly holding the object,
while manipulator B is executing the deﬁned task with the
tool. The position vectors of the origins of gripper frame
(S

of the two manipulators (S

assume that all joint stiffness matrices do not have coupling

A very interesting outcome of the above relation is the
deﬁnition of the desired Cartesian stiffness (the Cartesian
stiffness between S
T
and S

)

in relative coordinates.
This means that the need for transferring the conﬁguration-
dependent, desired Cartesian stiffness matrices of the two
robots with respect to the world frame to the task coordinates
is simpliﬁed, thanks to the deﬁnition of the relative Jacobian.
Such realization will be proﬁtable for dual-arm asymmetric
manipulation tasks using tools (e.g. carving, peeling, peg-in-
hole, etc) [20], since the speciﬁcation of the task parameters
in relative coordinates is more intuitive.
C. CMS and CDS Optimization Algorithm
To realize the desired Cartesian stiffness matrix (by trac-
king 21 elements in the symmetric matrix K
cd
), in absence
of preload forces (i.e. K
g
= 0), we differentiate the Eq. 3

Here, relying on the observations on coordinated stiffening
behavior of the arm joints in humans (e.g. see [19], [15],
[16]), we explore the concept of common mode stiffness
introduced in [18], in our dual-arm setup. Therefore, we
assume that the joint stiffness values are controlled in a
coordinated manner. To replicate similar behavior, we choose
a constant diagonal scaling matrix, K

order from base joint to the end-effector [27]) for each
arm while introducing two independently controlled common

respectively. Therefore, iterative optimization of the CMS
and CDS values will result in the realization of a desired
Cartesian stiffness proﬁle in realtime. In the meantime,
the desired motion of the tool w.r.t. the gripper frame of
reference will be assured due to the Eq. 5.
D. Task Prioritization
To execute a dual-arm manipulation task, the object must
be held in a reasonable position, inside the workspace,
w.r.t. the world frame of reference. This is accompanied
by the desired relative motion of the tool w.r.t. the object
frame, and cost-efﬁcient motion of the remaining degrees
of freedom in dual-arm kinematic chain. Therefore, the task
can be decomposed into subtasks with prioritized order of
occurrence.
An efﬁcient solution for stabilization of the task variables
in prioritized order is presented in [4]. Following that, to
preserve a desired position of the object w.r.t. the world
frame, the ﬁrst priority subtask is established as follow
˙ q

Our secondary subtask establishes the relative movement of
the two end effectors and its kinematic relationship is deﬁned
by the relative Jacobian of the two cooperative manipulators
(Eq. 1). Now, given the two subtasks, we setup the task-
priority based kinematic control [4], as follows

we use the damped least squares inverse solution which is

The third term in above equation projects the vector ˙ g
(Eq. 9), into a subspace (C2R

formed by remaining DoF that do not affect neither one of the
subtask variables, while, at the same time decreases the error
between the desired and realized relative stiffness proﬁle.

here we do not consider any constraints on the orientation of the ﬁrst
subtask.

such representation accommodates the incorporation of additional
subtasks such as joint and torque limit avoidance and etc.

Due to the fact that the proposed algorithm incorporates
human impedance regulation principles in realization of the
desired Cartesian stiffness proﬁle, we expect to obtain similar
performance and natural redundancy resolution as compared
with the humans.
The proposed CDS controller can also be utilized for
humanoid robots or upper body assistive devices with joints
with ﬁxed-passive stiffness values to fairly realize a desired
Cartesian stiffness proﬁle w.r.t. the object frame. In addition,
once the concept of common mode stiffness is integrated in
the hardware
5
, the CDS controller can be adopted to further
reduce the error between the realized and desired Cartesian
stiffness proﬁles.
III. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP
The efﬁciency of the proposed approach to cope with
contact stability issues while generating natural motions in
redundant space is evaluated in a Peg-in-Hole task, a classical
benchmark for spatial planning with uncertainties.
The dual-arm setup incorporated two seven DoF KUKA
LWR, with DLR’s Fast Research (FR) Interface [29]. A
peg and a hole were designed and mounted on the end
effectors of the two robots. To illustrate the capabilities of
the proposed controller in effective modulations of the size
and directionality of the realized endpoint stiffness in task
coordinates, the hole was mounted along different (x, y and
z) directions of S
G
. Then, three different desired Cartesian,
K
c
des
, stiffness proﬁles (stiff along the direction of the hole,
while realizing a compliant proﬁle along other directions to
avoid generation of high interaction forces) were deﬁned
and tracked by our proposed controller. The task-required
value of the desired Cartesian stiffness matrix along the hole
axis (in which there is friction) was chosen from the human
endpoint stiffness measurements [19]. A 6–axis force and

redundant DoFs in both arms are adapted to orient the

the frictional forces, while rendering a compliant behavior in
remaining directions to avoid generation of high interaction
forces.

Fig. 6: Common mode stiffness parameters of the two robots (left
and middle plots) are adapted in addition to the CDS to decrease
the error between the desired and realized stiffness ellipsoids (most
right plot), in realtime. The error at the begging of the experiment
can be though of a case in which only CMS optimization was
taken into account. While, synchronous optimization of the CMS
and CDS parameters results in an effective reduction in the stiffness
error proﬁle
The proposed algorithm establishes the realtime tracking
of the desired stiffness proﬁle in relative coordinates through
the optimization of the CMS and CDS. Starting from an
initial conﬁguration (Fig. 4. B), the CDS control drives the
redundant joints to a conﬁguration which is depicted in Fig.
4. C.
The desired (red, dashed) and realized (black, solid) el-
lipsoids are projected into the object’s frame of reference
and are depicted in Fig. 5. As seen in the plots, efﬁcient
elongation of the stiffness ellipsoid is perceived due to
the CDS control. Fig. 6 illustrates the adaptation of the
CMS values of the two robots (most left and middle plots),
synchronized with CDS control of the dual-arm setup. The
error (Fig. 6, most right plot) at the begging of the experiment
can be though of a case in which only CMS parameters’
optimization was taken into account. While, synchronous
optimization of the CMS and CDS parameters result in
effective reduction in the stiffness error proﬁle.
In another experiment, the hole was mounted along the
y axis of S

and the desired stiffness ellipsoid was de-
ﬁned to render a stiff behavior along the direction of the
hole, while being compliant along other directions. Starting

while the orientation was allowed to change due to the CDS. Human

the similarity in control principles.

CDS control drives the redundant joints to a conﬁguration
which is depicted in Fig. 7. C. Since the position of the
hole is considered ﬁxed, the CDS controller has maximally
adjusted the conﬁguration of the manipulator on the left,
not to violate the constraints on the position of the hole.
At the same time, efﬁcient control of the conﬁguration of
the manipulator on the right has been achieved. Similarities
between the natural posture of the human operator (Fig. 7.

again, give evidence to the analogy between incorporated
control principles. The normalize error between the realized

Effective modulations of the size and the directionality of
the realized stiffness ellipsoid in above examples illustrate
the capabilities of the proposed controller in realization of the
desired Cartesian stiffness proﬁle. In addition, our proposed
CDS controller achieves a natural redundancy resolution of
the dual-arm setup, which highlights its application in control
of the humanoids or upper body assistive or prosthesis
devices.
V. CONCLUSIONS
The paper proposed a new on-line motion controller
which regulates the Cartesian stiffness ellipsoid in a manner
inspired by human motor control and impedance regulation
principles. The presented scheme not only achieves effective
task space stiffness control but also intrinsically perform
redundancy resolution of the manipulator arm in a manner
that results in the generation of natural motion resembling
those executed by human in similar tasks. In particular,
relying on the observations on coordinated stiffening beha-
vior of the human arm joints, two common mode stiffness
(CMS) controllers were utilized. The CMS concept was
introduces in our dual arm controller by changing the joint
stiffness values of each robotic arm in a correlated manner.
This allows to regulate the size of the realized Cartesian
stiffness ellipsoid for each arm. Simultaneously, to align the
realized stiffness ellipsoid with the desired one, we explored
the concept of conﬁguration dependent stiffness (CDS) in
dual arm impedance control. Effectiveness of the proposed
algorithm in efﬁcient modiﬁcations of the realized size and
directionality of the task stiffness ellipsoid, while generating
natural movements, was evaluated in three assembly experi-
ments. Implementation of the CMS-CDS controller resulted
in good tracking performance, in addition to the generation
of natural movements, similar to the ones realized by human
operators.
It is worth to point out that, here, the naturalness of the
robot motions were mainly determined based on the visual
1485
comparison with human postures making similar tasks as the
ones commanded to the robot. Future works will be devoted
to the establishment of more solid metrics to measure the
naturalness of the robot motions and compare them to a “non
natural” redundancy resolution.
