Abstract? This paper presents a novel synthesis method
for the design of micro-scale robotic exure mechanisms. A
structural optimization method, termed the mechanism-based
approach, is used to identify the optimal topology and shape of
the exure mechanisms based on their lump stiffness character-
istics. Using several different tness functions, several optimal
exure designs have been synthesized for use in millimeter-
scale mobile grippers (-grippers). The stiffness characteristics
of the optimal -grippers are shown to be better than the
thin-beam designs developed using human intuition. Two large-
scale prototypes are constructed and experiments are conducted
to validate the stiffness analysis. The experimental results are
within 20% of the analytical expectations. As a proof of concept,
at-scale -grippers are constructed based on photolithography
and replica molding methods, and demonstrated in simple
actuation. The optimal -grippers can be applicable for cell
manipulations in future works.
I. INTRODUCTION
Mobile micro-robots show promise for non-invasive access
to microscale environments for manipulation and interaction
with the environment [1]?[3]. Due to their size, these robots
have great potential to be employed in many biotech, micro-
factory or healthcare applications which require noninvasive
access to small spaces [4]?[7]. Some potential applications
include utilizing these micro-robots to perform cell ma-
nipulation [8], [9], micropart assembly [10], or medical
procedures [11]. Previous efforts in remote micro-scale ma-
nipulation have involved pushing or uid-based manipulation
[5], [12]. However, these approaches suffer from a lack
of precision and 3D manipulation capability for complex
part orientation and assembly control. Thus, mobile micro-
sized grippers (-grippers) that are able to grip and transport
other micro-sized objects are the ideal candidates for such
applications.
The design for -grippers have been demonstrated by
Gracias et al., who utilize elastic at sheets as -grippers
by activating them via chemical or thermal means. Upon ac-
tivation, the at sheets will curl up to entrap/grab the micro-
objects [13], [14]. The micro-objects within the -grippers
can be manipulated effectively by using remote magnetic
forces to translate the -grippers. Although the response of
the-grippers are fast, the chemically- or thermally-activated
-grippers suffer from low actuation precision and in some

cases lack of repeatability. Larger-scale grippers based on the
design of compliant mechanisms that can grab micro-objects,
are however more common [15]?[17]. As the actuation for
these large grippers is delivered via elastic deformation, they
can achieve very high precision by eliminating dry friction,
backlash and hysteresis [18]?[20]. An additional advantage
of using compliant mechanisms is that their sizes are scalable
as their designs have ranged from micro- to large-length
scales [17]. For example, Kota et al. have designed MEMS
exures based on compliant mechanism design [21]. In order
to maximize a compliant mechanism's performance, the ratio
of non-actuating to actuating stiffness should be maximized.
This is because by having a low actuating stiffness, the
intended deection range for the compliant mechanism can
be increased. Likewise, the compliant mechanisms can re-
duce parasitic motions when they are subjected to external
wrenches if they have high non-actuating stiffness.
Based on the Pseudo-Rigid-Body (PRB) method, Shi et
al. and Mohamad et al. have designed grippers by replacing
the joints of a classical mechanism with compliant joints
[22], [23]. Both grippers have high non-actuating stiffness
but unfortunately, due to their high actuating stiffness,
their workspace of hundreds of microns is small relative
to the grippers' size (tens of millimeters). Although the
PRB method is a systematic approach for the synthesis of
compliant mechanisms, it should be noted that the design
of compliant joints is solely based on and potentially limited
by human intuition. Thus, the nalized compliant mechanism
may not have an optimal non-actuating to actuating stiffness
ratio. Another synthesis approach, the structural optimization
methods which depend on mathematical programming, has
been demonstrated by Sigmund et al. and Wang et al. for
the design of compliant mechanisms [17], [24]. Structural
optimization methods rst discretize the design space into a
mesh of identical nite elements where each element in the
space is taken as either solid or void. Based on the given
tness function, the state of the nite elements is evolved
until an optimum design is obtained. The stiffness character-
istics of the compliant mechanisms are determined by nite
element analysis (FEA) during the optimization. However,
the tness functions utilized for the grippers designed by
Sigmund et al. and Wang et al. are based on a tethered
design, where the location of the input and output points are
different. Thus, the presented tness functions and utilized
structural optimization algorithm are not applicable for the
-grippers where the location of their output and input points
coincide. This required optimization criteria should be based
on the lump stiffness characteristics of the -grippers and

Fig. 1: The conceptual design of the -gripper where each side
of the gripper has a rigid component and a compliant mechanism
component. The rigid component is used to grab micro-objects
while the compliant mechanism component is used to provide
the desired deections of the -gripper. The rigid components are
magnetized along they-direction and they will experience external
Mz torques when an external x-directional magnetic eld, Bx, is
applied. Due to the applied torque, the -grippers would ideally
have a large deection in the translational x-direction but small
deection in the rotary z-axis. Furthermore, the -grippers should
exhibit high stiffness when other external wrenches are applied.
such structural optimization problems in the literature are
rare.
This paper presents a novel synthesis method that can
synthesize compliant mechanism-based -grippers by using
the structural optimization method known as the mechanism-
based approach [25]. Optimized exure designs are demon-
strated in millimeter length-scale as a proof of concept
for micro-scale grippers. The obtained -grippers exhibit
better lump stiffness characteristics than the human-intutively
designed beam-type counterparts.
II. GRIPPER SYNTHESIS
A. Mechanism-based Approach
The conceptual design of the -gripper is shown in
Fig. 1, where each arm of the -gripper can be analyzed
as having a rigid component and a compliant mechanism
component. The function of the rigid component is to grab
and manipulate micro-objects while the compliant mecha-
nism component allows the -gripper to achieve its desired
deections. The rigid component which is located at the
gripper tip, is magnetized in the y-axis as shown, and
will experience an actuating torque, M
z
, about the z-axis
when an external magnetic eld in the x-direction (B
x
) is
applied. This magnetic torque acts to align the magnetic
moment, m, with the applied eld. The ideal characteristics
for the compliant mechanism component is to exhibit high
compliance in the translation x-axis when it is subjected to
M
z
while exhibiting high stiffness for all other wrenches.
This implies that the -gripper has only 1-DOF, and will
reject disturbances for robust object transport. In order to
synthesize a -gripper that has optimal lump stiffness char-
acteristics, the structural optimization method known as the
mechanism-based approach is utilized.
The mechanism-based approach is selected because it
has several distinct advantages over other existing structural

Fig. 2: The seeding process uses either of the two 6-bar linkages,
the Watt-Chain or the Stephenson-Chain, to represent the initial
topology of the compliant mechanism component, shown in (b).
The selection of the seed is dependant on the value of the variable
l. Once the seed is selected, it is superimposed onto the discrete
design domain where all the nite elements are initially selected as
void. The elements which are touched by the seed are converted
into solid elements, creating a corresponding structure, shown in
(c). The loading point of the structure is indicated by the location

optimization algorithms such as the SIMP [17], ESO [26]
and Level Set Methods [27]. As one major advantage,
it eliminates the possibility of having infeasible solutions
that contain elements that are neither void nor solid, or
disconnected solid elements. Furthermore, as the mechanism-
based approach uses Genetic Algorithm (GA) as its solver, it
exhibits good convergence. A description for the algorithm
is given now in brief, with a more detailed treatment in [25].
The algorithm rst discretizes the allowable design space
of the compliant mechanism component into a mesh of
identical nite elements. The elements in the mesh can only
have one of two discrete states, solid or void, and they are
all initially selected as void. As seeds to start the GA, two
1-DOF closed-loop traditional mechanisms that have iden-
tical kinematic requirement as the -gripper are identied
by using the Gr ubler equation [28], which describes the
number of Degrees-of-Freedom of a classical mechanism.
Two selected classical mechanisms are the commonly-known
6-bar linkages: Watt-Chain and Stephenson-Chain and their
topology can be seen in Fig. 2(b). These mechanisms are
chosen because they can exist in a symmetrical pose, which is
essential for the algorithm to generate symmetrical compliant
mechanisms. An advantage of having symmetrical compliant
mechanisms is that they can eliminate many parasitic com-
pliances compared with their asymmetrical counterparts. The
initial seeds' topology are used as the initial guess for the-
gripper. As there is more than one possible choice of seed, a
discrete design variable,l, is used to select one. The selected
seed is then superimposed onto the void design domain, as
shown in Fig. 2(b). Elements which came into contact with
the seed are converted into solid elements, thus generating
corresponding structures as shown in Fig. 2(c). A more
detailed description of the selection for the solid elements

Fig. 3: Several optimal compliant mechanisms are generated with
different tness functions. The numerator of the tness functions
represents the non-actuating stiffness and all the tness functions
have identical numerators. The denominator for each tness func-
tion represents the importance of the actuating compliance. Each
optimization uses a population of 100 chromosomes and they
converge within 40-60 generations.
can be found in [25]. Different compliant mechanisms can
be generated when the seeds' link lengths and orientations
vary. The topology of the -grippers can also be changed
if any link lengths of the seed are reduced to zero. As the
position of the links' tip are the design variables, they are
encoded in GA's chromosomes. The poses of the seeds are
constrained to be symmetrical about the vertical axis located
at the centre of the design domain. FEA is used to determine
the stiffness characteristics of each chromosome. Based on
the stiffness characteristics and the tness function, each
chromosome will be assigned with a corresponding tness
value. The FEA stiffness matrices for each element, K

the loading point can be obtained by pre-multiplying a matrix

represent the trans-

lational deections while the last three rows represent the
rotary deections. The actuating compliance is represented
by C

in C

. Fitness functions that maximize the non-
actuating to actuating stiffness ratio are used to evolve the
compliant mechanism gradually until an optimal solution is
determined.
B. The synthesis process
A design domain of 1:25 mm 1:25 mm with 50 m
thickness is chosen for the -gripper for ease of fabrication
using photolithography and replica molding. The utilized
material is a exible elastomer material (ST-1087, BJB
Enterprises), with Young's modulus and Poisson ratio from
the literature of 9:8 MPa and 0.45 respectively. The design
domain is discretized into a mesh of 25  25 20-node
quadratic nite element and each element has edge lengths
of 50m resolution due to manufacturing limitation. Several
different tness functions have been implemented to obtain
different -grippers with different optimal performance. For
any chosen tness functionf
i
, the optimization problem can
be dened as
minimizef

subject to: K

(4)
where the FEA governing equation is represented by the
equality constraint. The obtained optimal compliant mech-
anisms for four different tness functions are shown in
Fig. 3. The prominent non-actuating compliances for the
-gripper include the diagonal components in C
66
and
C
51
. The product of these parasitic compliances form the
numerators for all the tness functions as ideally they should
be small. The rotary parasitic compliances, i.e.C
44
,C
55
and
C
66
, and C
51
are regarded as more important for robust
gripper operations, thus they have a higher exponential to
represent a greater emphasis. The denominator of the tness
functions are different as they have different emphasis on
their actuating compliances, C
61
. Note that tness functions
that have stronger exmphasis for their actuating compliances
will raise C
61
to a higher exponential. All the optimization
process utilize a population of 100 chromosomes and the
optimization process converge within 40-60 generations. The
log-scale convergence plot for design 1 is shown as an exam-
ple in Fig. 4. The required time to perform each optimization
process is approximately 4-5 hours. Note that although the
obtained design can have more detailed features if the mesh
is ner, the required computational time will increase expo-
nentially. Thus, there is a compromise between the selection
of mesh and the required computational time to complete the
optimization. The jagged edges of the compliant mechanisms
are smoothened to eliminate stress concentration and they are
compared to thin-beam designs developed via human intution
as shown in Fig. 5. It is noteworthy that the topology of
each -gripper has been changed during the optimization
process. For example, the topologies for designs 1, 2 and
4 have been changed from their original six-bar linkages
seeds into a beam with different shapes. Table I compares
the compliance matrices of the optimized designs with the

intuitively-designed beam-type-gripper. Here, the width of
the intuitively-designed -gripper was chosen such that the
exure would have identical actuating compliance for ease
of comparison. A more optimal -gripper is one that has
lower magnitude of C
ij
in the C
66
. Note that in Table I,
C
61
< 0 because when the -gripper experiences a positve
M
z
torque, it will deect in the negative x-axis direction.
Based on the result listed in Table I, it is apparent that
the optimal structures are able to exhibit better stiffness
characteristics as they have lower parasitic compliance mag-
nitudes compared with the intutively designed counterpart.
This is especially true for design 1, where eight out of
nine components are better and some of the components are
approximately two times better.
III. EXPERIMENTS
In order to evaluate the accuracy of the FEA simulation,
up-scale prototypes of designs 1 and 2 have been constructed
as shown in Table II. Large-scale prototypes are used for ease
of deection and force measurement, which would require
N-level precision for the at-scale prototypes. The utilized
material is acetal with Young's modulus and Poisson ratio
of 3:1 GPa and 0.45 respectively. Note that the FEA results
are applicable for both the -grippers and their up-scale
counterparts. If the compliances of the prototypes can match
their FEA predictions, this indicates that the FEA prediction
for the -grippers' stiffness characteristics is accurate too.
The experimental setup is shown in Fig. 6(a), using design
2 as an example. Precise loading is induced by hanging
calibrated weights, and exure deections are measured by
a dial gauge indicator. The compliances of the prototype

identical actuating compliances. Based on the FEA, the optimal -grippers have exhibited better stiffness characteristics as most of their
components in the C66 are less than their intuitive designed counterparts. For example, the rst design has eight out nine lower parasitic
compliances compared to its counterpart.

can be determined experimentally from the slope of their
loadings against deection plots. By changing the orientation
of the prototype and the location of the dial, different
compliances can be evaluated. Eight compliances,C

for each prototype have
been validated. For all evaluated compliances, three sets of
data were collected and each set has 5 data points. Fig.
6(b) shows the deection plot for the actuating compliance
of design 1's prototype as an example while the complete
experimental data are shown in Table II.
Based on the experimental results, the maximum deviation
between the fabricated prototypes' stiffness characteristics
and the predicted compliances of FEA is 20%. The mean
deviation for all the experiments is 15%. This suggests that
the comparison made in Table I is accurate as well.
IV. AT-SCALE GRIPPER FABRICATION
Based on the designs shown in Section II, the -grippers
have been constructed by using photolithography and replica
molding. To fabricate -grippers from soft elastomer with
included magnetic particles, a replica molding technique is
used which is similar to that seen in [7]. The process includes
shape denition by photolithography, replica molding to
achieve exible elastomer gripper shapes, and a magneti-
zation process. The -grippers are made from a exible
elastomer material (ST-1087, BJB Enterprises) to allow for
larger deections given the same magnetic actuation. The de-
sign requires that each gripper tip be magnetized in opposite
directions, which is accomplished at the magnetization step
by deforming the-gripper arms 90

prior to magnetization.
The manufactured-grippers are shown in Fig. 7. Fabricated
-grippers were magnetized and actuated in a magnetic coil
system, with results shown in the supplementary video. The
actuators are capable of motion on a planar surface and open-
closing actuation in response to large-magnitude elds up to
10 mT in strength.
V. CONCLUSION
In this paper, a novel synthesis method for the design
of -grippers with optimal lump stiffness characteristics

signs.
based on the structural optimization method, the mechanism-
based approach, has been presented. An advantage of using
the mechanism-based approach is that it can eliminate the
possibility of having disconnected solid elements which
can be a prominent issue for optimizing the lump stiffness
of a compliant mechanism. This approach rst uses two
seeds, the 6-bar Watt- and Stephenson-Chains, as an initial
guess to represent the topologies of the -grippers. Based
on the chosen tness function, the topology of the -
gripper were gradually evolved to other topologies using
GA. The stiffness characteristics of each chromosome were
evaluated via FEA. Several tness functions were utilized
to arrive at several optimal compliant mechanisms. Using
FEA, the obtained optimal compliant mechanisms were
shown to exhibit better stiffness characteristics compared
to the intutively-designed thin beam design with identical
actuating compliances. Most of the parasitic compliances for
each design were shown to be reduced and some of these
parasitic compliances were shown to be approximately two
times smaller, representing signicant increase in desired-
gripper characteristics. The low parasitic compliances allow
the-grippers to execute complicated motions with minimal
parasitic motions as shown in the supplementary video. In
order to evaluate the accuracy of the FEA comparison, large-
scale prototypes were used to verify the stiffness properties
to be accurate with at most 20% error. Finally, functional at-
scale -grippers were constructed for potential micro-scale
manipulation applications. Future work will include testing
the manipulation performance of the at-scale grippers and
analysing the improvement in performance of the optimized
exure designs over the intuitively-designed beam construc-
tion. The presented optimization method will also be applied
to other micro-scale exure-based mechanisms where high
non-actuating stiffness is of prime importance.
