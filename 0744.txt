pulsion components for a multi-rotor aerial vehicle (MRAV), 
for a given payload, payload capacity, number of rotors and 
flight duration. A steady state model is developed for motors, 
propellers, electronic speed controllers (ESC), and batteries, 
using a simplified analysis. Based on technical specifications of 
batteries, motors and ESCs, component functional parameters 
are expressed as a function of an equivalent length. Propeller 
models are developed using experimental data. An optimization 
program is developed, which calculates the optimal design vec-
tor, employing as objective function the energy consumption or 
the vehicle diameter. Using this program, the influence of the 
payload and of the number of rotors on the design vector and 
the MRAV size is studied. The results obtained by the program 
were compared successfully to existing commercial MRAVs. 
 
Keywords: Multi-rotor aerial vehicle (MRAV) design, para-
metric design, constrained energy and size minimization. 
1. INTRODUCTION 
Recently, Multi-rotor Aerial Vehicles (MRAV) are encoun-
tered in an increasing number of military and civilian appli-
cations. A particular advantage an MRAV has over other 
aerial vehicles is its unique ability for vertical stationary 
flight (VTOL). Micro and mini MRAVs with payload capa-
bilities of up to 100g and 2kg respectively [1], offer major 
advantages when used for aerial surveillance and inspection 
in complex and dangerous indoor and outdoor environments. 
In addition, improvements and availability in cost effective 
batteries and other technologies, is rapidly increasing the 
scope for commercial opportunities. 
 In most MRAV configurations, rotors are in the same 
plane and symmetrically fixed on the airframe. To balance 
the torque produced by the rotors, the number of rotors is 
even. An exception is the trirotor, where one rotor is placed 
on a tilting mechanism that balances the excess toque. Addi-
tional configurations include MRAVs with multiple pairs of 
coaxial – counter rotating rotors, or experimental configura-
tions where the rotors are placed arbitrarily in 3D space [2], 
or even having the ability of thrust vectoring [3], [4]. 
Recent studies resulted in optimized designs of micro and

mini rotorcraft vehicle propellers that are easy to manufac-
ture, such as curved plate plastic propellers, [5], [6]. Howev-
er, in most cases MRAV components come from remotely 
controlled (RC) aircrafts. Consequently, an MRAV designer 
would benefit from an automated design method that would 
take into account all design requirements to yield an opti-
mized combination of commercially available components. 
Although studies on automated design methods were pro-
posed ([7], [8]), no method that takes into account both the 
propulsion system and the functional parameters of existing 
components exists. 
In this paper, we propose an MRAV design methodology, 
which selects the optimum propulsion system components. 
Given the MRAV design requirements such as payload, pay-
load capacity, number of rotors, and flight duration, a Matlab 
program calculates the propulsion system components and 
MRAV size that leads to an energy-efficient design or to a 
design with the smallest size. To achieve this, we use simpli-
fied models for each component and expressions of compo-
nent functional parameters as a function of component size, 
using their commercially available technical specifications.  
2. COMPONENT AND SYSTEM MODELING 
The components to be modeled include motors, electronic 
speed controllers, batteries, propellers and the airframe. 
Their simplified models will lead to a MRAV system model. 
2.1. Electric Motor Model 
The motors used in MRAV applications are Brushless Direct 
Current (BLDC), due to their high efficiency. Usually, out-
runners are used since their high torque constant (K
T
) allows 
direct propeller coupling, unlike with inrunners, which re-
quire a gearbox. Although a BLDC is a synchronous 3-phase 
permanent magnet motor, it can be modeled as a permanent 
magnet DC motor using a classic three-constant model. 
In this model V
k
 is the supply voltage (V), i
?
 is the current 
through the motor coils (A), e
?
 is the back-electromotive 
force (EMF) (V), R
?
 is the armature resistance (Ω) and ? is 
its shaft angular velocity (rad/s). The motor equations are:

motor torque constant (Nm/A), N is the motor rpm, and K
V

motor speed constant (rpm/V). The K

2.2. Electronic Speed Controller Model 
Electronic speed controllers regulate motor speed within a 
range depending on load and battery voltage. The important 
variable is ESC power loss, caused by its power MOSFETs 
and transistor drain-to-source “ON” state resistance R
DS(ON)
. 
The range of R
DS(ON)
 is between 3 and 15 mΩ, and its value 
depends on transistor size. Considering that ESC power 
losses are a small portion of input power, and the fact that 
ESC manufacturers do not include in ESC documentation 
the type of transistors used, we model the ESC as a constant 
value resistor of R
DS(ON)
=5 mΩ. BLDC motor ESCs use three 
pairs of transistors to manage the three phase currents, so the 
total resistance of the ESC will be: 
 
()

ESC DS ON
RR== Ω (8) 
Another important quantity of ESC is the maximum current 
i
ESC
 they can handle. This appears as a design constraint. 
2.3. Battery Model 
Due to their high energy density and discharge rate, MRAVs 
use Lithium Polymer (LiPo) batteries. A LiPo pack consists 
of identical LiPo cells each with a nominal voltage of 3.7 V. 
Parallel connection of battery packs raises the battery total 
capacity, while keeping the nominal total voltage the same. 
Therefore, the nominal total voltage of a LiPo battery is: 
 3.7
bc
Vn = (9) 
where n
c
 is the number of cells connected in series in a bat-
tery pack. The battery has an internal total resistance R
bat,tot
. 
When connected to a load its output voltage is: 
 
,, b out b bat tot
VViR = ? (10) 
where i is the battery load current. 
Each cell has internal resistance R

gy E

 we apply Kirchoff’s laws to a 
battery consisted of n

each of which consists of n

 identical cells connected in se-
ries. Each battery pack has an internal resistance:

2.4. Propeller Model 
Propellers used on MRAVs are mostly the same propellers 
used in remote controlled (RC) airplanes. Propeller perfor-
mance is described by its thrust T (N), power P (W) and 
torque M (Nm). To model performance in static conditions, 
we use manufacturer data such as propeller diameter D
p
 and 
its pitch p at 75% of its radius. Performance quantities are 
then related to propeller speed, diameter and pitch. This is 
achieved through a number of coefficients. 
The thrust coefficient is given by:

where T is thrust (N), ? is air density (kg/m3), N is propeller

These coefficients are next related to propeller diameter 
and pitch. Using the Blade Element Momentum Theory 
(BEMT) and a series of mild assumptions [9], we get the 
following equations for thrust and power coefficients:

lift coefficient – incidence angle curve, ?
0.75
 is propeller 
pitch angle at 75% of the propeller radius R, and C
d0
 is a 
blade airfoil drag coefficient for zero lift. 
To further simplify this model to a restricted propeller size 
range and geometry, we make the following assumptions. 
Considering that we refer to geometrically scaled propellers, 
propeller solidity ? will be constant regardless of propeller 
size. Additionally, if the propeller size range is no more than 
one order of magnitude, then the Reynolds number does not 
change dramatically, so we can assume that the aerodynamic 
quantities C
l?
 and C
d0
 are constant. Consequently, thrust and 
power coefficients are only a function of propeller pitch an-
gle ?

gion the function C

through a numerical solution. Additionally, by observing

2.5. System Model 
The system model results from the combination of the pro-
pulsion system model and the equilibrium of forces acting 
on the vehicle. The propulsion system consists of the battery 
and n
mot
 triples of ESC, and of the motors and propellers 
connected in parallel.  
The physical model of the propulsion system shown in 
Fig. 1, combines each component model and outputs the 
total thrust produced by the n
mot
 rotors. If all rotors have the 
same speed, the current drawn will be the same for each one.

Applying Kirchoff’s law to the circuit of Fig. 1 we get:

The rotor speed is given by:

 (24) 
The above equation is valid only at full throttle, when the 
ESC transistors are fully on; otherwise, at partially open 
throttle the ESC output voltage is less than the maximum, 
thus the motor voltage will be less than V
k
.  
Eq. (24) shows that the motor equivalent resistance is:

flight time t
tot
, in which motors are at full throttle state pro-
ducing the maximum static thrust, and (b) a hover mode, in 
which the vehicle hovers for the rest of the flight time.

3. PARAMETERIZATION 
The system equations depend on functional parameters, 
which define system response. Here, these parameters are 
expressed as a function of component length, taken as the 
cubic root of a component’s volume (cubic length), referred 
to as the equivalent length. We do the same with propellers 
using available experimental data. Furthermore, using ra-
tional geometric considerations and strength of materials 
theory, equations that correlate airframe size and mass as a 
function of propeller diameter, number of rotors and maxi-
mum thrust, ensuring airframe durability and its ability to 
accommodate electronics and batteries, were developed [10]. 
3.1. Electric Motor 
The electric motors we chose for parameterization are the 
outrunner BLDC motors from manufacturer AXI. The 
6268
  
choice based on the technical specifications availability, and 
on the performance of these motors.  
Here, the equivalent length of each motor is related to the 
outer dimensions of the motor, and not to its stator dimen-
sions. The parameters we want to relate to the equivalent 
length are the motor armature resistance R
?
, torque constant 
K
T
, no load current i
0
, and motor mass m
mot
. Additionally, 
motor maximum sustained current (or current capacity) i
max
, 
and motor maximum speed N
m,max
, are parameters that limit 
motor performance and must be related to equivalent length.  
After investigation of various correlations of these param-
eters to the equivalent length, we concluded the following 
functions due to their optimal fit to manufacturer data. Be-
low, R

 refers to coefficient of determination, and l
mot
 to mo-
tor equivalent length (m).

To relate motor mass to motor equivalent length, we cal-
culated the mean motor density ?

.  
3.2. Electronic Speed Controller 
We chose to parameterize ESCs from JETI due to the avail-
ability of technical specifications and their performance. 
Although the ESC is modeled as a constant resistance, addi-
tional parameters are needed that relate its operational limit 
and mass properties to its equivalent length l
ESC
 (m). These 
parameters are the ESC maximum sustained current i
ESC
, and 
ESC mean density ?
ESC
. Using ESC specifications, correla-
tions of maximum sustained current i

3.3. Battery 
We chose to parameterize batteries from Kokam for the 
same reasons as before. The parameters to be related to bat-
tery total equivalent length l
bat
 include total power P
bat,tot
, 
total energy E
bat,tot
, total resistance R
bat,tot
 and mass m
bat
.  
Battery specifications concern single 3.7V battery cells. 
However, we need information for any combination of paral-
lel and series connected cells. We assume that n
p
 cells con-
nected in parallel result in a larger single cell with volume 
B
vol
, power P
bat
, energy E
bat
, and internal resistance R
bat
. 
Assuming that the battery consists of n
p

 identical cells 
of volume B

 each, then an equivalent battery will consist 
of n

Therefore, each equivalent cell volume will be:

3.4. Propeller 
The propellers we chose to parameterize are taken from 
APC. The parameters to be related to propeller diameter D
p
 
and geometric pitch p, are the thrust and power coefficient, 
C
T
 and C
P
 respectively. Previously, it was shown through 
Eqs. (20) and (21), that for zero flight velocity, C
T
 and C
P
 
are functions of the ratio p/D
p
. The constants k
1
 through k
4
 in 
these equations depend on propeller design and the Reynolds 
number. Here, we are interested in propellers with diameter 
of 80 mm to 500 mm, therefore we use experimental data for 
these dimensions, so as to satisfy Reynolds number. 
Experiments on commercially available propellers used in 
remote controlled aircrafts, were conducted at the University 
of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) in a wind tunnel 
[11]. Here, data regarding SPORT type APC propellers are 
used. From the C
T
 and C
P
 measurements for these propellers, 
those that refer to static conditions are used here. We ob-
served that C
T
 and C
P
 are not affected much by propeller 
speed; therefore we calculated mean values of C
T
 and C
P
 for 
various speeds. These measurements concern propeller di-
ameter of 7 in to 14 in. Finally, the C
T
 and C
P
 were correlat-
ed to the ratio p/D
p

4. COMPONENT OPTIMAL SELECTION 
In the previous sections, component performance was related 
to its equivalent length. Next, a method is developed for the 
optimal lengths selection, which are parameters of the design 
vector. This vector minimizes an objective function, which is 
either the vehicle total energy, or the vehicle diameter D
rob
. 
4.1. Design Parameters 
The design requirements are described by a number of pa-
rameters set by the designer. These include the payload m
pl
, 
the total flight time t
tot
, the payload capacity described by f
w
 
indicating how many times the vehicle can lift its own 
weight, and the factor ATP which indicates the percentage of 
total flight time that the vehicle is at maximum thrust mode. 
The design vector consists of the number of battery cells 
n
c
 in series, the equivalent battery length l
bat
, the equivalent 
motor length l
mot
, the equivalent ESC length l
ESC
, the propel-
ler diameter D
p
, the ratio p/D
p
, and the number of rotors n
mot
. 
The design vector domain results from the size limits of 
the components that were parameterized earlier. Outside 
these regions the functions developed earlier may not apply. 
4.2. Calculation Procedure 
In every optimization step, the requirements vector (m
pl
, t
tot
, 
f
w
, ATP) is constant, while the design vector (n
c
, l
bat
, l
mot
, 
l
ESC
, D
p
, p/D
p
, n
mot
) changes until the minimization of objec-
tive function is reached. 
The calculation procedure follows the following sequence. 
At first, components quantities are calculated using (41) 
through (57). The battery nominal voltage V
b
 is calculated 
using (9). For the maximum thrust mode, using (30) we cal-
culate the speed N
acc
, then from (32) we get the motor cur-
rent i
acc
, and using (28) we calculate motor voltage V
k,acc
. 
The motor maximum speed is calculated using (26). Next, 
using (33), the maximum total input power P

 is calculat-
ed, while using (34) we find the total input energy at maxi-
mum thrust mode E
IN,acc
. For the hover mode, and using 
(36), we calculate the speed N

motor current i

ing (39), while the total input energy E

4.4. Optimization Methodology 
For the calculation procedure, a Matlab program was devel-
oped that employs the ‘fmincon’ function (minimum of con-
strained nonlinear multivariable function), which uses one 
target deterministic constrained optimization method for 
non-linear multivariable objective function. Our targets were 
to determine the most energy efficient design, or the smallest 
one. Hence, the objectives were the minimization of battery 
energy E
bat.tot
 or vehicle diameter D
rob
, respectively. 
In order to check that ‘fmincon’ would not be trapped in 
local minima, we also developed a program that scans the 
whole design vector domain, using nested loops. We ob-
served no differences between these methods after a number 
of test runs. Consequently, we considered that ‘fmincon’ 
calculates the absolute minimum for our objective functions. 
5. DESIGN SCENARIOS 
Using the calculation procedure described in Section 0, some 
test runs are carried out to study the influence of payload and 
number of rotors on the design vector and the MRAV size. 
In all scenarios, the requirement parameters are set to: t
tot
=15 
min, f
w
=2, ATP=0.1. Finally, we compare our program re-
sults to commercially available MRAVs designs.  
5.1. Study of the Parametric Influence 
Payload influence. The payload changes from zero to 1.5kg, 
while the number of rotors is 4 and constant. In Fig. 2, the 
payload influence on the design vector is shown; F
obj
 is the 
objective function, D
rob
 is the vehicle total diameter, and E
tot
 
is the battery total energy. We observe that as the payload 
increases, the equivalent length increases due to power in-
crease. Also, minimizing energy yields a more efficient but 
larger design than that obtained by minimizing vehicle size.

Fig. 2 Influence of payload on: (a) Vehicle diameter, (b) Total energy, (c) 
Motor length, (d) Battery weight, for 4 rotors. 
Observing the battery mass chart, we can say that battery 
mass is always lower for the minimization of total energy. 
Additionally, we can see that battery mass increases linearly 
with payload. For the quadrotor, we can say that we need 1.5 
kg of batteries for 1 kg payload; since the flight time is 15 
min, then we can say that for 1 kg payload we need 100 gr 
batteries for every minute of flight. 
Number of rotors influence. The number of rotors changes 
from 3 to 8, while the payload is constant and equal 1kg. In 
Fig. 3, the influence of rotor number on the design vector is 
presented. We observe that for energy minimization, the best 
design has 8 rotors, but this is true for a payload of 1kg, see 
Fig. 4. We observe also the expected decrease in component 
equivalent length when the number of rotors increases. Ad-
ditionally, the designer can further enrich the optimization 
procedure by adding a look-up table of discrete component 
values available on the market, as described in [12].

5.2. Test Cases 
Using the developed design methodology we can produce 
designs for various MRAV configurations. However, to de-
termine whether this methodology is valid and yields de-
signs close to reality, we compare program results to two 
existing commercial MRAVs. The first is the quadrotor 
Walkera HM Hoten X Quadcopter, a small MRAV designed 
for a payload less than 100 gr. The other is the Octocopter 
X88-J2, a large MRAV designed for aerial photography and 
for payloads up to 1.5 kg. 
Table I presents the quadrotor comparison, with data re-
trieved from [13]. The 0.1 kg payload includes the electron-
ics and control unit. Payload capacity is f
w
=2, ATP=0.1 and 
total flight time is 10 min. We observe that the program 
yields results very close to reality. The difference lies on 
battery configuration and mass. The actual vehicle uses two 
battery cells in series, and with total energy 
2·3.7V·1Ah=7.4Wh, while the optimized one needs 
1·3.7V·1.611Ah=6Wh. Therefore, the optimized vehicle 
appears to be more energy-efficient. 
In Table II, an octorotor comparison is presented, with da-
ta taken from [14]. The payload is 1.13 kg, payload capacity

Observe that the optimized vehicle is 8% heavier but 25% 
smaller. Also, the optimized vehicle batteries have twice the 
capacity because there are two battery cells in series. Thus, 
the total energy of the optimized vehicle is 2·3.7V·21.43Ah 
= 159Wh, while that of the actual vehicle is 4·3.7V·10.6Ah 
=157 Wh; i.e. the energy is almost the same in both designs. 
6. CONCLUSIONS 
This work focused on the parametric design and optimiza-
tion of a multi – rotor aerial vehicle (MRAV). Using simpli-
fied models of propulsion components, a system model for 
an MRAV was created and performance at hovering and at 
maximum thrust was described. Based on technical specifi-
cations of batteries, motors and ESCs, component functional 
parameters were expressed as a function of equivalent 
lengths. Propeller models were developed using experi-
mental data. An optimization program was developed which 
calculates the optimal design vector employing as objective 
function the energy consumption and vehicle diameter. Us-
ing this program, the influence of the payload and of the 
number of rotors on the design vector and the MRAV size 
was studied. The results obtained by the program were com-
pared to existing commercial MRAVs, showing that the de-
veloped methodology yields designs close to reality. In addi-
tion, it provides an MRAV designer with tools to improve 
existing designs, or create new ones.
