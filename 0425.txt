Application to Variable Damping Actuator

Abstract— On a new demand of safe human-robot interaction
for robotic applications, the Compact Compliant Actuator,
named CompAct
TM
, is recently developed with physical compli-
ance and active variable damping. In this mechanism, a desired
physical damping behavior is realized by generating a friction
force which is actively controlled by piezoelectric actuators
(PEAs). However, nonlinearities such as hysteresis and creep
effect make difﬁcult to precisely control the generated piezo-
electric force. This paper focuses on a development of precise
force tracking controller for PEAs. A time delay estimation
(TDE) using a force feedback is newly proposed to compensate
a hysteretic behavior of the PEA and external uncertainties
without a mathematical model. Thanks to the force-based TDE,
the proposed control is accurate, computationally efﬁcient and
easily implementable on the real PEA system. The proposed
control scheme is experimentally veriﬁed on the CompAct
TM
.
Root-mean-square values of the steady-state error for step
commands are kept as less than error ratio of 0.13 % and
the closed-loop system bandwidth for sinusoidal commands of
20 N stroke is conﬁrmed as about 11 Hz under 100 N payload.
In addition, the stability of the proposed control is proved to
be bounded-input-bounded-output (BIBO) stable.
I. INTRODUCTION
An emerging technology in the use of industrial-coworkers
and service robots is to introduce a physical compliance
inside the robot’s structure [1], [2]. Classical stiff and heavy
manipulators with high-gain controllers are not suitable to
operate close to a human and physically interact with the
surrounding environment. This is because conventional de-
sign and control approach make robots difﬁcult to interact
with its surroundings due to the large output mechanical
impedance which results in lack of robustness [3] and safety
[4]. Furthermore, other aspects can be jeopardized by this
actuation approach, e.g., energy efﬁciency [5].
This safety concern during human-robot interaction has
lead to the recent development of the Compact Compliant
Actuator, CompAct
TM
, where semi-active dampers/clutches
are incorporated into the compliant actuator design [6]–[8].
While the compliance is necessary to enable robots to work
in unstructured environments, it introduces several non-ideal
effects, e.g., under-damped dynamics limit the achievable
bandwidth of the controlled system; or oscillations radically
deteriorate an accuracy of the robot and might lead to
unstable behaviour [9], [10]. The semi-active damper in
CompAct
TM
assists in overcoming the limitations introduced
by the physical compliance in the actuator. Given that
integration density is paramount in most robotic designs, the

ideal actuator to drive the semi-active dampers must show
high force density, lightweight and an overall compact size.
A piezoelectric actuator (PEA) is certainly compatible with
such characteristics [11] and it has been used previously to
control the force generated by the semi-active damper in
[7]. In that work the force-regulated piezoelectric actuators
constitute an inner loop of a nested loop control architecture
and is therefore the basis of the whole control scheme signif-
icantly affecting its performance. Accordingly, an accurate
force control performance is particularly important in this
application of variable physical damping actuator.
The forces created by PEA are generated by controlling
the drive voltage and exploiting the “piezoelectric effect.”
However, PEA exhibits strong nonlinearities such as a hys-
teresis, since materials of the PEA are generally ferroelec-
tric. To obtain high control accuracy for the PEAs and to
remove unwanted harmonics in the closed-loop system, the
hysteresis effect must be compensated. There have been
several approaches to linearize PEAs using model-based
compensation strategies [12]–[15]. More speciﬁcally for
force control, the PEA models have been incorporated into
discrete proportional-integral (PI) control [16], sliding-mode
control (SMC) [17] and H-1 control [18]. However, it is
difﬁcult or time-consuming to obtain an exact mathematical
model and to identify system parameters of the model due
to the highly nonlinear and complicated dynamics of the
hysteresis effect. To mitigate this difﬁculty, other methods
investigated include use of neural networks [19], [20] and
disturbance observers (DOB) with SMC [21]: for the former,
the external force on the PEA is supposed to be zero or
constant, which is a satisfactory assumption for the position
tracking control; and for the latter, the controller needs an
additional force observer with DOB and the SMC uses the
second derivative of the force, which is normally undesirable.
Thus, there is still a need to develop force control which is
easy to implement, efﬁcient in real-time control basis, and
robust against nonlinearities.
As a such technique, we propose a precise model-free
force tracking controller based on a force-based time delay
estimation (TDE) and a simple proportional-derivative (PD)
force feedback control. The TDE was originally developed
to compensate nonlinear terms and uncertainties of robot
manipulator dynamics [22] and its efﬁciency and effec-
tiveness has been theoretically and practically proven in
previous researches [23], [24]. While the original TDE uses
intentionally time-delayed information of a control torque
and an acceleration at the previous time step, we propose
the force-based TDE which uses force feedback and control

voltage values at the previous time step to cancel nonlinear
hysteresis and other uncertainties of PEAs. Endowed by
the characteristic of the TDE, the proposed force control
provides accurate and robust tracking performance, while it
needs neither expensive computation nor off-line identiﬁca-
tion process. In addition, the PD-type servo control makes
a transient force response fast but smooth with a minimal
information using only a force measurement.
Therefore, the contribution of this paper is to develop
a precise, yet efﬁcient and robust force tracking control
for PEAs which can satisfy the requirements of practical
applications. We propose the force-based TDE to compensate
the nonlinearities of PEA such as the hysteresis effect,
without mathematical models and strive to show its stability
in a rigorous manner. The proposed controller is physically
implemented on the CompAct
TM
system. Through experi-
ments, its tracking performance for various force commands
is validated.
II. SYSTEM OVERVIEW
A. Compact Compliant Actuator with Piezoelectric Stacks
The CompAct
TM
, shown in Fig. 1, is a series elastic
actuator (SEA) made of a brushless motor coupled to a
harmonic-drive gear and a custom-made elastic transmission
system [7]. Unlike tradition SEA, the elastic element also
incorporates a custom-made clutch forming a variable damp-
ing element forming a Variable Physical Damping Actuator
(VPDA). The VPDA module integrated in the CompAct
TM
provides on demand friction braking torque in parallel to the
joint compliance. A PEA composed by four piezoelectric
stacks provides the normal force to be delivered to the trans-
mission clutch to generate the friction braking torque. By
regulating the PEA force and therefore the friction torque on
the basis of the velocity of the compliant element deﬂection
damping regulation can be achieved. The force generated by
piezoelectric stacks is sensed by means of a custom-made
force sensor based on strain gauges which is placed at a
base of the PEA system. To achieve precise physical damping
regulation on the VPDA, it is very important that the force
generated by the PEA system can be accurately and robustly
controlled.
B. Dynamics of PEA System
The dynamic model of a single piezoelectric stack can be
expressed as a combination of second order dynamics with
nonlinear hysteresis [25]. Accordingly, the dynamics of the
PEA system shown in Fig. 2 can be described as follows:

respectively, x, _ x, and  x represent position, velocity and

III. CONTROLLER DESIGN
A. Control Objectives
The target of the control is to allow the generated force
from the PEA system to track a desired force trajectory. A
force tracking error between the actual sensed force and the
desired force is deﬁned as

An additive requirement in this paper is to minimise the
computation demand for the force controller, because the
control law will be physically implemented on a Digital
Signal Processor (DSP) together with other motion control
schemes for CompAct

system such as a motor position
control, a damping estimator and a controller for the regula-
tion of the VPDA system [7].

B. Controller Derivation
To control the PEA system by a voltage steering, the
dynamic equation of the system shown in (1) is rearranged
as
u =

(m
e
 x+b
e
_ x+k
e
x+d h(x;u))+

f
s
: (3)
As a practical consideration, we introduce a positive constant
value ^  as an estimated value of . Then, one can reformu-
late (3) as follows:
u =(x; _ x; x;u)+ ^ 
 1
f
s
; (4)
where (x; _ x; x;u) includes a force induced by all the non-
linearities of PEA system such as the hysteresis behaviour.
This is deﬁned by
(x; _ x; x;u) =

(5)
wheref
s
can be regarded as a function ofx when a dynamics
of the contact surface such as a stiffness and a damping is
considered. Hereinafter, for simplicity of the expression, 
indicates (x; _ x; x;u).
To achieve precise force tracking, the control voltage input
is designed as
u =u
c
+u
servo
: (6)
The ﬁrst term of the right hand side of (6) involves cancelling
out the nonlinearities of the system  such as the hysteresis
and the creep effect in PEAs; and the second term is an
auxiliary servo control to inject the desired error dynamics
and to shape a transient response of the closed-loop system.
First, to select u
c
, we use the TDE technique which
indirectly performs an estimation of uncertain dynamics as
follows:
u
c
= ^ 

=
(t L)
; (7)
where ^  denotes an estimation of,L denotes an intentional
time delay, and the subscript of (t L) denotes its value at
the delayed time of L. Provided that L is sufﬁciently small,

(t L)
can be a good estimate of 
(t)
as follows:
lim
L!0

(t L)

(t)
: (8)
This assumption holds because a sampled-data system can be
treated as a continuous system when the sampling frequency
is higher than 30 times than the system bandwidth [26].
Note that due to discontinuous nonlinearities, there exists
an inevitable estimation error which is discussed in stability
analysis.
From (4), the TDE for  can be obtained as follows:

A novelty of this controller is to use the TDE technique
based on a force feedback, thus called force-based TDE. The
corresponding stability is analyzed in Section IV.
Second, for the force-tracking of the system, the ﬁrst-order
desired force error dynamics is deﬁned as

simple PD-type error dynamics is practically considered to
minimise the computation demand for the control algorithm.
Then, the auxiliary servo control in (6), u

to provide the above desired error dynamics to the force-
controlled system as follows:

C. Discussion on the Proposed Controller
As seen in the above equation, the terms of proposed
controller has clear meaning. The force-based TDE is used
to compensate for the nonlinearities of the PEA system
including hysteresis and unmodeled dynamics without a
mathematical model; hence this makes the proposed control
simple and model-free. The PD-type force feedback leads
the PEA system to accurately follow the desired force
trajectory by adjusting the gain K
d
. Thanks to the simple
structure of the control law, its required computation effort
is no more than that of conventional PID control, making it
computationally efﬁcient.
For a physical implementation, a ﬁrst-order digital low-
pass ﬁlter is practically utilized to reduce a noise of the
ﬁsrt derivative of f
s
as a minimum use of the ﬁlter. In
the controller, the selection of ^ 
 1
signiﬁcantly affects the
control performance. Theoretically, the best selection of ^ 
 1
is a nominal value of, the electromechanical transformation
ratio between the control voltage and the generated force
of PEA. However, for more practicality, ^ 
 1
is tuned by
increasing from a small positive value until the system shows
an oscillating response. Detailed discussion on the controller
gains ^

can be found in the following section, i.e.,
stability analysis. Additionally, for more clear description
of the proposed controller, a block diagram is illustrated in
Fig. 3.

a closed-loop dynamics of the system is obtained as

this residual error  for a stability proof of the closed-loop
system.
From (6), (7), and (4), the residual error (14) can be
expressed as

In (20), it is important to notice that the hysteresis op-
erator h(x;u) is not a smooth function, but a Lipschitz-
continuous function [27]. The uncertain external disturbance
d is discontinuous but bounded, and  x can be assumed
to be bounded because we consider the PEA system is
physically constrained to the contact surface as shown in
Fig. 2. Therefore, the term  can be divided into smooth
(continuous and differentiable), Lipschitz-continuous, and
bounded terms as follows:

are satisﬁed,

Lipshitz-continuous condition, we can obtain that

Substitutingf

where the subscript k denotes its value of the k

(k)
,

are forcing functions
which are bounded for a sufﬁcient small sampling periodL.
Therefore, if the root of(1 =^ ) resides inside a unit circle,
the equation (26) is ultimately bounded as
jj; (27)
where  is a positive value. The residual error after the
force-based TDE can become small by reducing the sampling
period L, as deduced from (8).

As shown in (28), the gain K
d
determines a convergence
speed of the closed-loop system response. Thus, the gain
is set as a desired time constant. One can ﬁnd that even
though very small K
d
gain, the stability of the controller
is still guaranteed and the force response converges to the
desired trajectory quickly. However, if K
d
becomes smaller,
the effect of the residual error  is increased. Conversely,
large K
d
can reduce the effect of  but it may amplify a
noise effect of the derivative of the sensed force,
_
f
s
. Note
that
_
f
s
is easily contaminated by the noise of the sensed
force and the numerical differentiation in a real situation.
Indeed, K
d
is experimentally selected by a user to achieve
a compromise among convergence speed, tracking accuracy,
and noisy response.
V. EXPERIMENTAL VERIFICATION
A. Experiment Setting
The proposed force tracking controller is physically imple-
mented on the PEA of CompAct
TM
system. The PEA system
consists of four piezoelectric stacks, Noliac SCMAP04, with
a size of 5655 mm, weight of 12 g and stroke of 82.2m.
A custom-made force sensor based on a strain gauge is
mounted for the sensing of the force applied by the PEA
system. The noise of the sensed force was measured as the
root-mean-squared value (RMS) of 0.307 N.
The control hardware is provided with a motor control
board equipped with a Motorola DSP 56F8000 chip running
at a sampling frequency of 1 kHz. Data acquisition is
executed using 12-bit analog-to-digital converters while the
analogue control input to the piezoelectric driver ampliﬁer is
generated by 12-bit digital-to-analog converters. The latter
board is used for amplifying the control signals for the PEA
system in the nominal voltage range of [0, 160] V .
The settings of the proposed force controller are as fol-
lows: the controller gains in (12) are selected as ^

is observed, which is one of undesirable response normally
resulted from the creep effect of PEAs [29]. The peaks and
sudden changes of the control input just after t=1;3;5;7:5;
and 9s imply that the proposed control operates to quickly
compensate the delayed behavior of PEA resulted from the
phase transformation in the piezoelectric material. Hence, it
is conﬁrmed that the hysteresis and creep behavior of the
PEA system is effectively compensated by the force-based
TDE in the proposed controller. Furthermore, the control
input has no serious oscillation in spite of the use of the force
derivative in (12). This veriﬁes that the proposed controller
is practically implementable to the real system.
The validation of the tracking performance of the pro-
posed control, is investigated by sending to the experimen-
tal setup sinusoidal references with different frequencies
from 1 to 12 Hz with the amplitude of 10 N, f
d
(t) =
100+10sin(2f
q
t), where f
q
denotes the frequency of the
trajectory. As shown in Fig. 5, the PEA system shows a
better performance in the low frequency. The results are
summarized in Table. I. The approximated bandwidth of the
controller is conﬁrmed as 11 Hz under the stroke of 20 N
and the preload of 100 N .
C. Comparison Study with PI controller
To validate the effectiveness of the proposed controller,
we demonstrate experimental comparisons to a PI-force
controller represented by
u =K
p
e
f
+K
i
Z
e
f
dt: (29)
For a fair comparison, gains of the PI controller are tuned
as K
p
= 2:67 10
 3
and K
i
= 0:11 10
 3
, which are
managed to be tuned to have the fastest convergence and
smallest steady-state error, by trial and error.
Interestingly, ﬁgures 6 (a) and (b) show that the results of
best-tuned PI control also quickly converge to each desired
force with small steady-state error: for instance, its RMS
value for 100 N step command after t=1s is 0.426 N, while
that of the proposed control is 0.384 N. However, large
overshoots are observed as 74.1 % for 100 N step command
and 51.7 % for 200 N step command, while those of the
proposed control are 6.1 % and 0.1 %, respectively. This
overshoot of PI control was very difﬁcult to be removed.
A consistent result when applying PI controller to the PEA
can be found in [29], which is mostly caused by creep
effect of the PEA. Therefore, it is conﬁrmed by the above
experimental results that the proposed control can effectively
compensate the hysteresis and creep effect thanks to force-
based TDE and provide fast but smooth force tracking
performance.
VI. CONCLUSIONS
This work has proposed a method of implementing pre-
cise force tracking performance for a piezoelectric actu-
ator system incorporated into the recent development of
CompAct
TM
. The force-based time-delay estimation is pro-
posed to compensate nonlinearities arising the hysteresis of
piezoelectric stacks, with small computation efforts. The
simple proportional-derivative type force feedback enables
the quick and smooth transient response. The experiment
results on PEA system mounted on the CompAct
TM
show
that the proposed controller performs precise and robust force
tracking without using mathematical model. Our future work
will focus on an application study of realizing desired phys-
ical damping behavior to CompAct
TM
arm system by using
the proposed controller. A preliminary result is introduced in
a companion paper submitted to ICRA 2014 [30]. In addition,
a possible extension of the current scheme is to ﬁnd a way
to reduce the effect of the residual error for more accurate
tracking performance.
