for experimental grasp studies

Abstract—Measuring contact forces applied by a hand to a
grasped object is a necessary step to understand the mysteries
that still hide in the unparalleled human grasping ability.
Nevertheless, simultaneous collection of information about the
position of contacts and about the magnitude and direction
of forces is still an elusive task. In this paper we introduce a
wearable device that addresses this problem, and can be used
to measure generalized forces during grasping. By assembling
two supports around a commercial 6-axis force/torque sensor
we obtain a thimble that can be easily positioned on a ﬁngertip.
The device is used in conjunction with an active marker-
based motion capture system to simultaneously obtain absolute
position and orientation of the thimbles, without requiring any
assumptions on the kinematics of the hand. Finally, using the
contact centroidalgorithm,introducedin[1],positionof contact
points during grasping are determined. This paper shows the
design and implementation of the device, as well as some
preliminary experimental validation.
I. INTRODUCTION
The human hand has a complicated structure and a high
number of degrees of freedom. Despite this underlying com-
plexity, experimental evidence suggested through the years
that, within the space of all the possible conﬁgurations, only
a few basic movements, normally referred to as synergies,
explain the postures assumed while grasping typical objects
[2]. This concept does not apply only to postures, but also to
ﬁnger contact forces [3]: the phenomenon appears to extend
throughthewholeneuromuscularsystem [4]. Synergieshave
an immediate and practical application in the construction of
robotic hands, since they can be used to simplify design and
control of what would otherwise be a very complex system
[5]. Measurementsrelated to the humanhand kinematicsand
dynamicsareafundamentalprerequisiteforthestudyofsyn-
ergies. However, while several works address measurement
and estimation of posture (see for example [6]-[7]), force
related measurements provide a greater challenge, especially
when the goal is to obtain complete information regarding
both force and torque. This is often achieved by using
sensorized objects [8], that can either compel grasping from
predetermined locations, as in [3], or leave the possibility
of a more generic grasping conﬁguration, as in [9], even if
this sometimes comes at the cost of sacriﬁcing the number
of possible contacts between the hand and the object.
An alternative approach consists in applying sensors di-
rectly on the hand, to favor versatility: this can be ac-
complished by using gloves (see [10] for some examples)

which, however, usually use pressure sensors, and thus do
not provide any information regarding shear forces. More
advanced approaches exist that measure forces while leaving
the ﬁngerpad free from occlusion: in [11] the relationship
between nail strain and compression forces on the ﬁngerpad
was studied, while in [12] the horizontal deformation of
ﬁngerpadswasusedto estimatenormalforces.In[13]ﬁnger-
nail sensors were introduced that correlate blood distribution
under the ﬁnger nail with forces, which later publications
further developed and reﬁned (see for example [14]). This
last solution is particularly interesting since it also provides
measurements for shear forces, however, it requires ﬁne
calibration and, to the best of our knowledge, currently
provides no information regarding the position of contact
points.
This work presents the ThimbleSense, a design for a
sensor system which can be worn on ﬁngertips and gives
complete measurement of all components of generalized
forces applied upon grasped objects. This is achieved by
combining a commercial six axis force/torque sensor with
a pair of support shells, blending the two conventional
approaches by building a wearable sensorized object. To
obtain position and orientation of the system we integrate
the sensors with a high-speed camera-based active motion
capture system, which provides a convenient and precise

way to measure position. By using the algorithm proposed
in [1], it is possible to determine the position on the thimble
of the centroid of contact with the object being touched:
it is worth pointing out that torque measurements, as those
provided by the ThimbleSense, are necessary to apply this
algorithm. Combination of all this information provides full
reconstructionofgraspforcesvectors,intermsofmagnitude,
direction and application point.
The proposed design can also be easily applied to existing
robotic hands (as shown e.g. in ﬁg. 2), enabling precise
online measurement of contact forces and contact position,
without re-designing and replacing the usually costly hard-
ware components of the robot.
II. PROBLEM DEFINITION
The measurement of forces and torques on a ﬁngertip
can be cast as a generic structural mechanics problem. To
try and analyze the possible solutions let us abstract from
the physical problem at state, and consider the simple 2D
example shown in Fig. 3(a). A rigid body A, attached to
a frame, withstands a force P applied on a point O at
position l, perpendicularly with respect to its main axis. Let
us suppose that a sensor S, able to measure force F and
torque M applied on its surface, is available. The simplest
course of action to measure the applied force is interjecting
the sensor between the applied force and the object A, as
in ﬁg. 3(b). This solution, which is in general possible only
when the position l is known a-priori, has the disadvantage
of dislocating the point in which the forceP is applied from
the original O to the remote O
?
. This displacement could
be recovered by excavating a hole inside the objectA and
using it to integrate the sensor (ﬁg. 3(c)); or it could be
removed altogether by splitting the structure in two parts,
separatingbodyA fromthe frameand interposingthesensor
between them, as in ﬁg. 3(d). This would allow, from the
measurements of force F and torque M, the straightforward
reconstruction of P = F and l =
M
P
, and thus of both
the magnitude and position of the contact force. It is worth
pointing out that without torque measurement it would not
be possible to estimate the position of the contact.
The three approaches exposed so far lead the design of
common sensorized objects, but they can not be applied to
a human ﬁnger: approaches 3(c) and 3(d) are invasive with
respect to the ﬁnger, while approach 3(b) is invasive with
respect to the grasp itself, owing to the typical dimensions
of force/torque sensors. The problem can then be deﬁned as
designing a sensor capable of results similar to those ob-
tainable with approach 3(d) (simultaneous reconstruction of
forceandcontactposition),whichcanbeplacedontheﬁnger
without completely altering the grasp with interposition of
a cumbersome object between the ﬁnger and the contact.
Fig.3(e)showsapossiblesolution:byassemblingthesensor
S between the object A and a properly designed shell B
we obtain a system which is completely non-invasive to the
ﬁnger, while also minimizing alteration to the way the load
is applied. In this regard it can be noticed that, as in solution
3(b), the load is not directly applied on point O but on a
different point O
?
; however, contrarily to solution 3(b), a
proper design of the shell B can substantially contain the
distance OO
?
. This last solution was selected for our device
and led to the concept of ﬁg. 3(f). The next section shows
how this concept is transformed into a design and physically
built.
III. OUR APPROACH
The concept behind the design of the ThimbleSense is
as follows: a F/T sensor is assembled between an inner
and an outer shell separated by a gap. The ﬁnger ﬁnds its
accomodation inside the inner shell, and once the outer shell
gets in contact with an object the action applied is routed
though the sensor, which constitutes the only mechanical
coupling element between the two shells. Owing to this a
completemeasurementofforcesandtorquescanbeobtained:
thus, since geometry of the external support is known, it is
possible to obtain the position of the contact centroid of the
loading force P, through the algorithm deﬁned in [1].
A number of factors must be taken into account to obtain
a functional design, namely:
• Size: the device must be as small as possible, to mini-
mizeencumbrance.Consequently,alllayersbetweenthe
ﬁnger and the external surface of the outer shell must
be as thin as possible; at the same time they need to
be thick enough to keep the outer shell separated from
the inner shell when a load is applied (for a contact
between the two would invalidate the measurement).
• Weight: the device needs to be light, to minimize the
effort necessary to move it. For this reason a material
with a high stiffness/weight ratio should be chosen.
• Ergonomics: the device must be shaped in such a way
as to leave ﬁnger movements unhindered,as much as it
is possible.
Overall, the grasping process should ideally be unaffected,
and it should be possible to seamlessly place ﬁve devices,
oneon each ﬁnger,withoutthem excessively interferingwith
hand movements and grasping capabilities. However, it is

naturaltoexpectthatwearingarigidshellovertheﬁngerwill
somehow alter the grasping process: this problem has been
subject of study in [15], where it was shown that wearing a
rigid shell on ﬁngers signiﬁcantly alters haptic recognition
of common objects. We acknowledge that this is going to be
an intrinsic limitations of our design: however, in this paper
we hope to show how it is still possible to perform everyday
tasks while wearing the device. We reserve a more thorough
veriﬁcation of this particular aspect for later work.
IV. MECHANICAL DESIGN
To ﬁnalize the mechanical design of the ThimbleSense
shells, the ATI nano 17 six axis F/T sensor was selected.
Because of its high stiffness/weight ratio, the material
chosen to build the thimbles is aluminium. In an attempt
to minimize weight and encumbrance of the device, a Finite
Element Analysis (FEA) is performed on the CAD model of
thedevice,withtheaimofﬁndingtheminimumthicknessfor
the shells and the gap,still guaranteeingthe shells separation
when they elastically deform under load application.
To perform FEA, a load model is introduced. From some
basic tests performed by pressing a ﬁnger on a high pre-
cision scale, reasonable bounds of the forces applied were
estimated. An average value for the force was found to be
10 N, while 35 N appearedas a superiorlimit, achievedonly
through an extreme effort. In an attempt to be conservative,
loads on the structure were modeled as localized forces
applied on the bottom surface of the open ends of either
the inner and the outer shell.
A custom model has been deﬁned to describe the sensor
mechanical properties, with elastic modulus coherent to the
elastic constants obtained from the data sheet of the sensor.
Trials were performed for various thicknesses: we show here
results for a design where thickness is 1 mm for both shells

and the gap. Fig. 4 shows a static structural model with a
localized force applied on the inner shell. It can be seen that
the simulation result showsdeformationssmaller than1 mm:
since the load model chosen is by far an overestimation of
the actual load, this seems to be adequate from a mechanical
point of view. In Fig. 5 a load model where a force is
appliedontheoutershellisshown.Inthis casetheforcealso
presents a signiﬁcant lateral component. The deformation is
close to 1 mm, which is considered to be acceptable owing
to the high load, and the fact that this sensor is designed to
work with forces having a low lateral component.
It is worth noting that it would not be desirable to have
a thicker shell, since that would cause greater weight and
encumbrance. On the other hand, reducing the thickness
could cause the shells to come in contact when a load is
applied. The result of our design procedure can be seen
in Fig. 6, which shows an exploded view of the ﬁnal
CAD model, together with the list of components of one
ThimbleSense.
Different people have different sizes for their ﬁngers,
moreover, a signiﬁcant difference in size is present also
between different ﬁngers of the same hand. The experiments
in this paper are preliminary in their nature, and use a single

test subject. For this reason only two thimble sizes were
necessary: a larger one (25 mm diameter for the interior
of the inner thimble) for the thumb, and a smaller one (21
mm diameter) for the other ﬁngers. Designing and building
additional sizes is planned as future work.
Grasping objects with a smooth, metal thimble is not an
easy task due to the low friction. To restore friction to levels
comparable with those of human skin, a friction surface
was applied to the outer shell in order to mimic the natural
friction behaviorof humanskin. The friction surface is made
of double sided sticky tape covered with a masking paint
mixed with ﬁne grain sand: it can be seen in Fig. 8(b).
The ThimbleSenseis nowdesigned:however,we still need
a reliableway to placeit on ﬁngertips.Ideally,we wouldlike
theinnersurfaceofthethimbletobeperfectlyattachedtothe
skin.To try and minimizetherelativemovementbetween the
device and the hand, a fabric glove is designed with female
velcro over ﬁngertips, while male velcro is applied to the
inside of the ThimbleSense (Fig. 7). Moreover, elastic bands
aretied aroundﬁngersto preventmovementofthefabricand
increase stability. This component is what makes the device
wearable, and it is used to interface hand and thimbles in the
experiments shown in section VI.
V. POSITION AND ORIENTATION ESTIMATION
The developed design allows to measure generalized
forcesappliedtoathimble,whichiswornonﬁngertipswhile
grasping objects. However, the measurements from the F/T
sensorareexpressedinaframethatisattachedtothethimble
itself. To locate the contact data in a global reference frame
a way to obtain position and orientation of the thimbles is
needed.
Position and orientation of a rigid body can be estimated
from the position of a numberof pointsattached to it [16]. A
possible way to obtain coordinates of points attached to the
thimbleisbyusingamotioncapturesystemandplacingLED
markers on a support attached to the thimble. In our setup,
we chose the Phase Space motion capture system [17], and
designed and realized suitable ABS plastic supportsto attach
to the thimbles the LED beacons, which are all uniquely
identiﬁed by the system through an ID.
To make sure that the minimum number of three markers
needed to estimate rigid body motion is always available,
four marker slots are designed on the support, so that it
is acceptable for the motion capture system to occasionally
drop tracking of one marker during acquisition. Such slots
are all placed at different heights over the surface of the
support,tomaximizevisibility.TheCADmodelandphysical
realization are shown in Fig. 8.
VI. EXPERIMENTAL VALIDATION
In this section we proceed to show some preliminary
experiments that make use of the full capabilities of our
device. All the sensors used in all experiments have SI-50-
0.5 calibration (see [18] for more details).
A. Reconstruction of contact forces and positions on the
thimble
In this experiment, a ﬁrst validation of the device is
performedto have a qualitative estimation of the accuracy of
force/torque measurements and of the contact point estima-
tion algorithm. To do that, we apply some medical tape on
the external surface of the ﬁngertip device, with six points
marked,as shown in Fig. 9(a). The thimble is then placed on
a ﬁnger, which lays on a ﬁxed support (Fig. 9(b)): the points
are pressed with a sharp tool (a pen), in the order shown in
Fig.9(a).Themeasurementsareread duringthetask through
a LabVIEW VI, which allows to obtain a sampling rate of
1 kHz.
Fig. 9 shows the results of this experiment. Fig. 9(c)
shows contact points with forces applied for six samples of
time, one for each target. Fig. 9(e) , 8(f) and 9(g) show
components for forces and torques applied in the contact
point, and contact point coordinates (for the samples where
they are available), as expressed in the reference frame {F}.
Intervals of time when there is a contact on the sensor
surface can be clearly identiﬁed in Fig. 9(e) and 9(g):
after a short transient, contact point coordinates stabilize to
a steady value. The visual feedback from reconstruction in
Fig. 9(c) is realistic: to validate this numerically in Fig. 9(h)
we show mean values of all the components, together with
variance reconstructionof initiation and termination times of
the contact. It can be seen how the contact point estimate is
fairly stable once the contact itself is in its steady state.
B. Complete contact forces and positions reconstruction
during grasp
This second experimentshows a qualitative reconstruction
of postures of the thimbles and of applied forces. For this
purpose, a subject wears the ThimbleSense while executing
ﬁve tasks that involve objects of different shapes. The ﬁve
tasks are designed to carry different degrees of challenge for
the device. Fig. 10 shows the objects used for the ﬁve tasks
with main dimensions (in mm), as well as the task execution
and the reconstruction of the contact forces and positions.
Please refer to that ﬁgure for the following discussion.
The ﬁrst task is a basic one: the subject is simply required
to lift a light (46.7 grams) ball. While this task does not
present a particular degree of challenge for the device, it can
be interesting to see in Fig. 10(k) the opposition between
the force applied by the thumb and forces applied by other
ﬁngers.
The second task has the subject lift a soft paper cup
partially ﬁlled with water (mass 168.8 grams).The challenge
is slightly higher for this task, since more careful control
of forces is required to avoid excessive deformation. As in
the previous task, the reconstruction seems plausible and
opposition can again be noticed between the force exerted
by the thumb and those by the other ﬁngers.
In the third task a partially ﬁlled bottle with a screw
cap needs to be opened (mass 251.3 grams). The degree of
challenge here is substantially higher compared to the ﬁrst
two tasks, since a nimbler movement needs to be performed
to open the bottle. Fig. 10(m) shows reconstruction of
postures and forces: view from the bottom allow to notice
how the three forces act in order to exert a net torque on the
bottle cap.
The fourth task consists in lifting a one dollar coin (mass
8 grams) placed on a small support. This task is challenging

owing to the small size of the object to be grasped and to the
precision of the operation involved. The possibility of lifting
a coin while wearing the device is an indication of how the
device does not hinder performing nimble operations.
Finally, the ﬁfth task involves lifting an egg (mass 58.3
grams). As previously discussed, a limitation of our device
isthatwhilewearingasubjectispreventanydirectcutaneous
feedback. It is thus interesting to see how precise force
control can be. This is exactly the scope of this last task:
lifting an egg without breaking it requires proper control of
theforcesappliedbyﬁngertips,andthefactthatthis task can
be performed while wearing the device shows that it allows
to retain a certain degree of precision.
The tasks described in this section were aimed to give
a sample of the device versatility, and to show that despite
the alteration of cutaneous feedback it is still possible to
perform nimble tasks; deeper force analysis is demanded to
future works.
C. Comparison with a sensorized object
In this section we perform a last experiment to compare
readings from the wearable device with those coming from
a trusted sensorized object, as a further validation. Fig. 11(a)
shows the setup: an inverted T sensorized object, similar
to the one used in [9], is lifted while wearing the device
on two ﬁngers. An unbalancing mass is placed on the left
side of the object: the task requires to lift it while keeping
it level, meaning that a compensatory moment needs to be
applied to balance the effect of the weight. Contrarily to the
work presented in [9], we are not interested in performing
an analysis of learning, thus a bubble level is attached to the
inverted T, in other to make the task trivial for the subject.

of time: in Fig. 11(b) the complete grasping setup is recon-
structed, while Fig. 11(c) and Fig. 11(d) show posture and
forcesrespectivelyforthewearabledeviceandthesensorized
object.
This task allows more detailed study and numerical com-
parison of forces. Quantities considered are force compo-
nents tangential and normal to the object, and the com-
pensatory moment required to contrast the action of the
weight. Following the convention introduced in [9], we
assume normal force to be positive when the ﬁngers are
pressingagainsttheinvertedT,tangentialforceto bepositive
when the object is lifted, and the compensatory moment
to be positive when it contrasts the action of the mass.
Measurements of these quantities are obtained from both
devices,andcomparedbycalculatingthedifferencesfortotal

Fig. 12 shows plots for these quantities. It can be seen
in Fig. 12 (a)- (b) that, while normal forces are basically
the same, there is a minor difference in values of tangential
forces, which averages at around 0.5 N and decreases once
a steady state is reached. This can be ascribed to the glove
setup: while the presence of elastic bands helps keeping
cables steady on the hand, it also potentially induces a
distorting effect when the hand is moving and/or applying a
force.
Fig. 12 (c) shows plots for compensatory moments and
total tangential forces, comparing them with the moment
caused by the side weight (100.5 N mm) and the force from
the global weight of the object (6.67 N), respectively. The
difference between values of tangential forces as measured
from the thimbles and the inverted T also causes a small
difference between the compensatory moments.
Moreover, Fig. 12 (d)-(e) show that, as a consequence
of differences in forces, contact point coordinates also have
differences of components (a few millimeters).
To providea better understanding of the task development
Fig. 12 (f) shows the roll angle of the invert T, which is
an indication of how successful the task was. In can be
seen that the inclination stays fairly low: it is in fact barely
distinguishable from the slight inclination of the table where

are better quantiﬁed in Fig. 12 (g).
VII. CONCLUSIONS
This paperpresented thedesign and implementationof the
ThimbleSense, a wearable device that allows to obtain mea-
surements of forces applied during grasping and to estimate
the position of the contact points over their external surface.
By combining it with a motion capture system we have
also been able to integrate force measurements with position
and orientation estimation which, in turn, allows to express
forces and contact point components in absolute reference
frames. Five ThimbleSense with their absolute localization
system areintegratedthroughuseofafabricgloveandtested
experimentally.
Experimental validations qualitatively show the accuracy
in estimating the contact point (VI-A) and the position and
orientation of ﬁngertips (VI-B). To achieve a more quantita-
tive comparison with a reliable reference,a validation with a
sensorized object has also been performed (VI-C). Results
from this last validation show small differences between
the wearable device measurements and the sensorized object
readings, which can be ascribed to the glove setup.
Owing to the versatility in being able to measure forces
and ﬁngertips position and orientation during grasping of
variously shaped objects, we believe that this device shows
promise to be a powerful tool in studying human hand
behaviour.Ongoing work will involve performing a more
thorough validation, by trying to reproduce results obtained
in previous publications with sensorized objects. Moreover,
some room for improvement is left on the design of the
device, especially on the design of a localization setup
less cumbersome respect to the adopted to motion capture
systems, and a setup which provides a more stable support
than the fabric glove with elastic bands we used here.
