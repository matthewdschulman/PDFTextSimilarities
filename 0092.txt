Abstract? In this paper, we present a posture control scheme
for step climbing by an in-house developed three-segmented
tracked robot, miniUGV . The posture control scheme results
in minimum torque at the actuated joints of the segments.
Non-linear optimization is carried out ofine for progressively
decreasing distance of the robot from the step with torque
minimization as objective function and force balance, motor
torque limits, slippage avoidance and interference avoidance
constraints. The resulting angles of the joints are tted to a
third degree polynomial as a function of the robot distance
from the step and the step height. It is shown that a single set
of polynomial functions is sufcient for climbing steps of all
permissible heights and angles of attack of the front segment.
The methodology has been veried through simulation followed
by implementation on the real robot. As a consequence of
this optimization we nd that the average current reduced by
more than thirty percent, reducing power consumption and
conrming the efcacy of the optimization framework.
I. INTRODUCTION
Energy optimization in step climbing by tracked mobile
robots is the focus of this paper. Miniature mobile robots
are often used in urban and off-road scenarios where steps
are a common feature of the terrain. Tracked locomotion is
highly suitable for such terrain and various congurations
of tracked robots have been developed and are available
commercially. Examples of these are the xed track robots,
e.g. Talon [1] and Matilda [2], tracks with ippers robots, e.g.
Packbot [3] and dual ipper robots, e.g. Chaos [4]. We have
developed a man-portable three segmented tracked robot
called miniUGV . This robot has been developed with the aim
of carrying out surveillance in urban and off-road scenarios.
The robot is often required to cross stepped structures such
as foot-paths, ledges, thresholds, railway tracks and piles of
debris or construction material, wherein the robot needs to
traverse over several vertical discontinuities. In [5] and [6]
design of single segment tracked robots suitable for step/stair
climbing has been carried out. Multi-segmented and variable
geometry based tracked robots can make use of their re-
congurability to climb steps higher than the diameter of
drive pulleys. However making these robots climb purely
by teleoperation is a difcult task. Hence autonomous tech-
niques for climbing steps/stair with minimal sensors and
computational requirement need to be devised. In [7], [8],
[9] and [10] force analysis and interference avoiding criteria
has been used to determine the feasible postures at various

stages of climbing which result in stable congurations. In
[11] on-board camera is used to determine the state of the
robot with respect to stairs for autonomous stable climbing.
In [12] computer vision along with inertial sensors is used
for determining parameters of stairs and state of the robot
for stable climbing. All the research effort in these systems
focuses on arriving at kinematically feasible and stable states
of robot for climbing steps/stairs.
However energy consumption is also a critical factor to
be taken into account during step/stair climbing. Mobile
robots require lesser power for traversing on at terrain
as compared to climbing steps or stairs. Recongurable
robots can be made to adopt postures during step climbing
which result in less power consumption. Control schemes
for energy optimization have been developed for wheeled
robots with passive and active suspension mechanisms [13],
[14] and [15]. However, the energy optimization in these
systems focused on minimizing the traction forces at the
wheel ground interaction rather than torques of active joints.
No similar schemes for multi-segmented tracked robots have
been reported in the literature.
A major difference between wheeled and tracked robots
is the location of contact point between robot and terrain.
The contact points in wheeled robots are limited to the
circumference of the wheel while the contact point on tracked
robots can move over full length of the track. Additionally,
location of the contact point depends on the approach angle
of the tracks. Hence a methodology needs to be developed
that take into account the shifting contact point.
In this paper we present a methodology to determine
the posture of the three-segmented tracked robot, miniUGV ,
during step climbing which results in torque minimization.
The resulting posture has been implemented using two third
degree polynomials which are a function of the step distance
and height of the step. At present, the robot has no sensors
for measuring step height and step distance. Step height is
fed a priori to the robot and the robot velocity is used to
estimate the step distance. However, step height and distance
can easily be measured by integration of a laser range
scanner. The polynomial curves used for posture control
generalize step climbing over various heights and approach
angle of the robot. The maximum step height traversable
with scheme presented is 0.325m and results in reduction
of power consumption by nearly 30%. The methodology
has been veried by multi-body dynamics simulation tool,
MSC VISUAL NASTRAN and implemented on the three-
segmented robot, miniUGV .

II. NOVELTIES
A key advantage of the methodology presented in this
work is that the posture control scheme can be implemented
in real time with minimal computational overhead. Posture
control is achieved using single set of polynomials for
calculating the desired angles of the segments as a function
of step distance and step height. A single set of polynomials
that generalizes over various step heights and angle of
attacks of the robot does not seem to have been reported
in earlier literature. Apart from computational savings the
optimization framework results in signicantly lower power
budget that is crucial in several outdoor scenarios where the
robot has to traverse terrain with limited onboard batteries.
This scheme helps to determine the instantaneous postures
which result in minimum torque requirement to maintain
a statically stable state. Hence the power consumption is
reduced irresapective of the speed of the robot resulting in
overall energy minimization.
III. SYSTEM DESCRIPTION
Fig. 1 shows the three-segmented robot, miniUGV . The
three segments comprise the rear, front and middle segments
connected through active joints. Each of these segments has
two tracked sections placed symmetrically about the central
longitudinal plane. Sections to the right constitute the right-
track while to the left constitute the left-track. The rear
and front segments and the right and left tracks are driven
independently by PMDC servomotors. Middle segment is
a xed height section while front and rear segments are
tapered. The middle segment has been slightly raised in
the real robot to accommodate the electronics. However a
symmetric shape has been used for analysis as this has no
effect on the optimization.

of the joint motors. Each motor controller has a dedicated
microcontroller which communicates with a master con-

communicates with a hand-held operator control unit or host
computer using a dedicated wireless link. The Linux box is
also used for capturing, compressing and sending the data
from two onboard cameras.
Step climbing sequence for miniUGV is shown in Fig. 3.
The sequence has three distinct stages. In nominal state, the
front segment is at an angle called angle of attack and rear
segment is horizontal. Stage-1 of climbing starts as soon as
the front segment comes in contact with the step edge and
continues till the front segment crosses the step edge. Stage-
2 starts at this point and continues till the centre of mass
(CoM) of middle segment has crossed the step edge. Stages-
3 starts at this point and continues till the whole robot has
crossed the step.
IV. PROBLEM DEFINITION
Amongst the three stages of climbing, stage-1 and stage-2
are the most power consuming stages. In these stages the
entire mass of the robot gets lifted. In stage-3 the balancing
moment topples the whole body towards the front. As a result
the robot is fully supported by middle segment and no load
comes on the joints of front and rear segments. We therefore
analyzed stage-1 and stage-2 of climbing for energy mini-
mization. However, the energy minimum posture throughout
the stage-2 is same as the last optimized posture in stage-1.
Hence analysis was carried out for stage-1 of climbing. En-
ergy consumed depends on the current drawn by the motors
which in turn determine the torque required for maintaining a

particular posture. Hence the energy minimization is carried
out as a posture control optimization problem with torque
minimization as objective function. We seek to determine
the angles of front and rear segments using the optimization
which fully dene the posture of the robot. To carry out the
optimization, system constraints need to be dened which
result in a feasible solution. The system constraints can be
divided into force balance, torque limit, slippage avoidance,
geometric and interference avoidance constraints. Analysis
for determining the constraints is carried out for planar case
since the robot is symmetric about the central longitudinal
plane.
A. Force Balance Constraint
The force balance equations which satisfy static equilib-
rium for the stage-1 are determined using the free body

The robot has two coordinate frames; one is body frame

pointing towards front and second is world frame W with
origin same as B but having Y-axis aligned to gravity. Hence

Similarly, it can be concluded from Fig. 9 that the optimum
values of

are independent of the angle of attack and
depend only on the location of the contact point which in turn
depends on the step height, H
step
and the distance D

It should therefore be possible to approximate the optimum
values of 

by polynomial functions which depend
only on the step height,H

and the distanceD

. These
polynomial functions should work for all permissible step

Angles for the front and rear segments can be calculated
using (15) and (16) which are given to the robot to achieve
step climbing with minimum torque posture during stage-1.
As the distance, D
step
, reduces to zero the contact point of
the robot shifts from the front segment to middle segment
marking the beginning of stage-2. The robot is still in
minimum torque conguration and same posture can be
maintained throughout stage-2. As the robot moves forward
the CoM of middle segment crosses the step edge and robot
enters stage-3 of climbing. The front and rear segments
can be rotated away from the terrain at this stage and the
balancing moment results in the whole load supported by
middle segment.
VII. SIMULATION
Using the control scheme described above, simulation
was carried out on 3D model of the robot using MSC
VISUAL NASTRAN for dynamics simulation and MATLAB
SIMULINK for control. The front and rear joint motors
are modeled as velocity control rotary actuators. The track
motion is emulated by giving surface velocity to the three
segments. Step distance and actual angles of the front and
rear segments are read from MSC VISUAL NASTRAN by
SIMULINK control program. The control program calculates
the desired angles of the front and rear segments based on the
polynomials (15) and (16). The error in desired and actual
values of the angles is used to calculate the velocities of
the two joint motors and fed back to the MSC VISUAL
NASTRAN model.
A. Step Climbing Simulation
Simulation was carried out for step heights of 0.12m,
0.16m, 0.2m and 0.24m and initial angle of attack equal
to 45 degrees. The robot is able to climb steps easily with
the posture control scheme. It is found that if the posture
control is not implemented the robot is not able to climb at
all. However, the real system is able to climb steps due to
the presence of cleats along the tracks.

The plots of the torques of front and rear segment motor
joints during the three stages of climbing are shown in
Fig. 11 for step height of 0.24m.It can be seen from the
plots of the torques that the magnitude of peak torques is
within the maximum limit of motor torques of 35Nm. The
torques required during climbing reduce by a factor of ten
from beginning to the end of stage-1. Magnitude of the
torques required during stage-2 and stage-3 are less than 3
Nm. Snapshots of step climbing sequence during simulation
are shown in Fig. 12.

B. Maximum Step Height Analysis
In order to maximize the step height which the robot can
climb the angle of attack can be chosen to make front surface
of the front segment parallel to the step. However to ensure a
single point of contact with the step edge the angle of attack
is kept at 72 degrees resulting in a angle of 5 degrees between
the step edge and front segment face as shown in Fig. 13.
Step climbing simulation was carried out for different step
heights. It was observed that for step height greater than
0.325m the robot completes the stage-1 but topples over
before reaching the end of stage-2. This situation arises when
the CoM of the middle segment does not cross the step edge
and nally results in a moment which topples the robot over.
Fig. 14 shows the two situations in which the robot ips to
a stable state by end of stage-2 for step height of 0.32m and
ip over backwards for step height of 0.33m. The maximum
height the robot is able to climb successfully is therefore
found to 0.325m.

VIII. IMPLEMENTATION ON REAL SYSTEM
Subsequent to verication of the methodology in sim-
ulation the algorithm was implemented on the miniUGV .
The polynomials for controlling the front and rear joints
were implemented in the master controller on the robot.
Depending on the height parameter fed through the remote
control station via the onboard Linux box and the distance
of the step estimated from the speed command for the
tracks, the master controller calculates the desired angles and
feeds them to the joint controllers in real-time. The joint
controllers operating in position control mode achieve the
desired angle. In order to measure the total torque applied
by the joint motors the motor power was fed from a power
supply with current display. The miniUGV was made to
climb a step of 0.24m with optimization based algorithm.
Fig. 15 gives snapshots of the climbing sequence with
optimization implemented. The miniUGV was also made to
climb without the optimization by using a xed posture,
similar to the one shown in Start of Stage-1 in Fig. 15,
throughout the climbing sequence. Multiple runs of climbing
the same step were carried out with and without optimization
and the average currents drawn during various stages of
climbing were recorded. The average currents drawn during
the different stages of climbing in both cases is given in Table
III. The standard deviation in the average currents drawn
during various runs was found to be within 10%. The overall
average current during a climbing sequence is taken as the
average of the current during the three stages since the time
taken in each stage is approximately equal. It can be seen
that there is approximately 30% decrease in average power
consumption when using the control scheme presented in this
paper.

IX. CONCLUSION
The posture control methodology developed and presented
in this paper, results in torque minimization during step
climbing. Implementation of the methodology using polyno-
mials can be easily realized on embedded system to achieve
real-time operation. The methodology has been validated
on a multi-tracked robot miniUGV resulting in reduction
of the total power consumption during step climbing. The
methodology has been tested on a simulated step in labo-
ratory conditions. The same will be extended to real world
scenarios such as climbing a ledge, debris and footpath as
shown in Fig. 16. At present the robot is able to accomplish
these without optimization.
