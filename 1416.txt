AbstractÑThis paper provides kinematic analysis and local
motion planning methods for multi-limbed robots. In particular,
we consider combined stance and reach tasks for robotic
mechanisms whose limbs can be used either as legs or manip-
ulator arms. An example of such a system is the RoboSimian
robot participating in the DARPA Robotics Challenge (Figure
1). We develop relationships which model the key quasi-
statics and kinematics of these mechanisms: the stance map,
the stance Jacobian, and the reach Jacobian, as well as the
stance constrained center-of-mass Jacobian. We also introduce
characterizations of multi-limbed mechanism conÞgurations in
terms of the properties of these maps: local dexterity and
limberness. This paper also introduces local planning methods
which seek to balance the motion of legs, body, and arms of
such mechanisms so as to realize manipulation goals while also
maintaining awareness of stance stability issues. Examples with
a simple planar model illustrate the methods.
I. INTRODUCTION
Fig. 1. RoboSimian. Designed by NASA\JPL-Caltech
Figure 1 depicts the RoboSimian robot, a competitor in
the DARPA Robotics Challenge (DRC). Each of this robotÕs
four limbs can be used either as a leg, or as a manipulator (a
3-Þngered hand is attached to the distal end of each limb).
To locomote over rough terrain, this vehicle can use standard
quasi-static gait planning and coordination techniques. How-
ever, many tasks which this robot must accomplish involve
using some limbs as legs to provide a stable stance, while one
or more other limbs simultaneously carry out a manipulation
task, such as turning a water valve, or picking up a Þre hose.
In practice, this robot and its peers will initially be used
in hazardous environments for activities, like disaster relief,
where there is a human operator in the loop, minimizing the
need for complete high level autonomy. However, the joint
motions required to move an end-effector as desired can be
extremely counterintuitive due to the complex workspace of
such mechanisms, their high number of mechanical degrees
of freedom, and the need to account for stance stability
throughout the task. Hence, local planning methods are
needed to assist the human operators, and these methods
would serve as a percursor to completely autonomous future
operation of such vehicles.
The local planning problem that motivates this paper is
the following:
Problem Statement. Consider a multi-limbed robot with
n ³ 4 limbs in the presence of gravity. Let the end effectors
at the end of the limbs involved in stance be called feet, and
let the surfaces contacted by the feet be termed footholds
or holds. Assume that 3 or more feet are placed on holds
so as to form a quasi-statically stable stance. One limb is
used to carry out a manipulation task. How should all of
the limbs and joints be adjusted during the manipulation
task so as to satisfy the manipulation task constraints while
also accomodating postural stability? In particular, the robot
should move so as to
¥ Maintain the same contacts at the footholds,
¥ Maintain a suitable stance stability margin,
¥ Satisfy end-effector task motion and force constraints.
This paper develops the basic kinematic relationships as-
sociated with these problems, and some preliminary planning
solutions based on these relations. Our goal is to facilitate
the provision of guarantees for arbitrary legged robots.
Relation to Prior Work. Quasi-static multi-legged locomo-
tion has been well-studied, the foundation for which was
laid in [1], [2] and built upon in many works, for example
[3], [4]. The analysis of static equilibrium and quasi-static
stability for legged robots with attention to contacts (friction,
curvature etc.) has been approached from both theoretical
[5]Ð[8] and computational [7], [9] standpoints. The local
planning methods introduced in this paper build upon the
prior characterizations of stance equilibria, as we seek to
determine those motions which satisfy manipulation criteria
while also attempting to maintain the center of mass within
the support region.
The relationship between the center of mass motion and

joint motion is central to the problem of free ßoating space
manipulators (e.g. [10]). In contrast to the space manipulator
problem, the center of mass location for the systems that we
study is not conserved, and its motion must also take into
account the reaction forces generated by the stance limbs.
Manipulation from a legged robot platform has not been
explored deeply, but some work has been done for humanoids
( [11]Ð[13]). Accounting for the position of the center of
mass is very important for those working with humanoids,
and Ref. [14] details the relationship between joint velocities
and center of mass motion in relation to notions of dynamic
disturbance rejection; a number of other works build on this
result. [15] provides methods for dynamic locomotion, and
describes the construction of a whole body Jacobian that is
applied as part of a hierarchical redundancy-resolution based
controller.
We take advantage of the fact that multi-limbed standing
manipulation has many similarities to dextrous manipulation
by multi-Þngered robotic hands. Many authors [4], [9], [16]Ð
[18] have previously noted these similarities. One of the
contributions of this paper is to make these analogies explicit.
The class of mechanisms studied in this paper invariably
have many degrees of freedom, and often have internal
motions that are analogous to the self motions of redundant
manipulators. Our local planning methods borrow several
concepts from the classical literature on manipulator redun-
dancy resolution [19], [20]. But the governing kinematic
equations have a slightly different linear algebraic structure,
requiring a new set of formulae to be derived.
While sampling based planners have proven effective in
many high dimensional problems [21], [22], we have found
them to be slow in this particular problem: Robosimian
has 28 joints - sampling without very special bias could
be prohibitively inefÞcient
1
. Moreover, a straightforward
sampling planner would not take stance stability issues into
account. Thus, there is a need to develop the appropriate
physical relationships and local planning techniques for this
domain.
Structure of the Paper. Section II develops the basic kine-
matic relationships that govern combined stance and reach.
Section III induces some basic stance/reach properties which
can be assessed using these relations. Section IV derives the
stance-constrained center of mass Jacobian matrix. Section V
introduces several local kinematic motion planning problems
which build upon the results of Sections II and IV, while
Section VI illustrates the methods on a simple planar multi-
limbed mechanism.
II. MULTI-LIMBED STANCE AND REACH KINEMATICS
Figure 2 depicts an n-limbed robot with one limb used as
a manipulator, while the other limbs provide a (potentially)
quasistatically stable stance. The goal of this section is to
derive the kinematic relationships which relate end-effector

a particular end-effector towards a goal pose kinematically, even when mass
and contact are not accounted for.

motions to mechanism joint motions. Section IV will derive
analogous relationships for center of mass motion. While we
focus on the case of a single manipulation limb, the methods
can be extended to multiple manipulating limbs.
Let a world (Þxed) reference frame be denoted by W.We
assume that a terrain model is available from which one can
derive the location, height, and contact normals associated to
each foothold. A user-selected frame attached to the robotÕs
main body, or abdomen, is denoted by A (see Fig. 2). For
each limb, the shoulder reference frame, S
j
, is located at the
point where the j
th
limb attaches to the abdomen body, and
is Þxed with respect to A. Without loss of generality, the
stance legs are indexed j=1,...,n?1, while the reaching
limb has index n. The end effector frame at the distal end of
the n
th
limb is denoted by E. For limbs that are positioned
on holds, the foot frame, denoted F
j
, is rigidly attached to
the foot body, with origin at the point of ground contact
2
.
The i
th
contact frame, C
i
, is Þxed with origin at the contact
between the i
th
limb and the ground, and is oriented with
the surface of the i
th
hold. The joint angles corresponding
to the i

limb are

To Þnd the relationship between end-effector motions and
robot joint motions, let the homogeneous transformation
between end-effector frame E and Þxed frame W be denoted

We call (12) the stance constrained Reach Constraint,or

can reach for a certain goal by coordinating the motions of
its legs and its manipulator limb (assuming that the footholds
are maintained).
III. PROPERTIES OF A STANCE
This section provides some local,or instantaneous no-
tions of the properties of the combined stance/reach system
analyzed in the last section. Most of these properties are
analogous to those of multi-Þngered robotic grasps, with
modest extensions required to handle the presence of the
reaching limb.
DeÞnition 1: A limbed robot stance is limber at a conÞg-
uration (

?,x
0
) when for any motion of the abdomen V
A
WA
,
there exists
ú

? satisfying equation (9).
DeÞnition 2: A limbed robot stance is locally dexterous
with respect to a free limb at a conÞguration (?,x
0
) when
for any motion of the end effector, V
A
WE
, there exists
ú
?
satisfying (12).
A robot is limber if it can locally move its abdomen in all di-
rections via leg joint motions while maintaining its footholds,
and it is locally dextrous if the reaching end-effector can
instantaneously move in any direction by allowed mechanism
joint motions. The following propositions result directly from
DeÞnitions 1 and 2, as well as Eq.s (9) and (12).
Proposition 1: Suppose that S is onto. A stance is limber
at a conÞguration (?,x
0
) if and only if
Range(S
T
) ? Range(J
S
(

?,x
0
)).
Proposition 2: Suppose that S is onto. A stance is locally
dexterous with respect to a limb at a conÞguration (?,x
0
)
if and only if
Range(S
T
) ? Range(J
R
(?,x
0
)). (13)
Furthermore, for a given conÞguration, a robot is locally
dexterous if any of the following hold
i) it is limber.
ii) J
n
(?
n
) is onto the pre-image of Range(S
T
) (or equiv-
alently, onto the complement of Null(S
T
)).
This fact is a consequence of Eq. (12). The most interesting
situations occur when
¥ The robot is locally dexterous, but not limber, and the
free limbÕs Jacobian matrix is not onto the compliment
of Null(S
T
). At these conÞgurations, both the body
and the reaching arm must work in concert to realize
arbitarary end-effector motions.
¥ The robot is limber and the free limb Jacobian matrix is
onto the pre-image of the Range(S
T
). In this case, there
are many ways of producing the desired end effector
velocity. The solution might depend on other goals, and
this possibility is explored in Section V
Other properties which are standard in multi-Þngered grasp-
ing also extend to this situation. LetFC
ci
denote the friction
cone associated with each contact c
i
, and let FC denote
the totality of friction cone constraints: FC = FC

immovable object or solid ground, The net wrench on the

= S

f

f ?FC
where

f =(f

,...,f

)
T
are the contact forces at the
footholds.
DeÞnition 3: A stance is wrench-resistant if it can coun-
teract any external wrench F
e
, i.e. there exists f ?FC such
that
Sf = ?F
e
Proposition 3: A stance is wrench-resistant if and only if
S restricted to FC is full rank, i.e.
S(FC)=R

IV. THE CENTER OF MASS STANCE JACOBIAN
It is well known that quasi-static stability of a given stance
depends upon the location of the mechanismÕs center of
mass relative to the support region generated by the stanceÕs
footholds [1], [5]Ð[7], [9]. Hence, it is crucial to Þnd a
relationship between mechanism joint motions and center-
of-mass motion. This relationship can then be used during
the task planning process to maintain or enhance a suitable
stability margin whilte realizing manipulation goals.

is given by C=(1/M)

that only the translational component of g

is relevant to
the analysis.
Let m

V. LOCAL MOTION PLANNING
This section uses the relationships developed in the pre-
vious section to develop local planning methods for stance-
constrained manipulation. Intuitively speaking, the goal of
these local planning methods is to move the end-effector
so as to satisfy task goals and/or constraints, while also
simultaneously moving the center of mass so as to enhance,
maintain, or gracefully degrade stance stability. There are
many different conceivable types of problems and analtyical
approaches that one may take to realize these intuitively
obvious goals. The remainder of this section introduces,
roughly in order of increasing complexity, a few basic local
task planning problems and their relation solutions. These
solutions would be useful components of a local planning
toolkit for stance-constrained manipulation.
A. Problem #1: The Minimum Norm Solution
This Þrst solution, which ignores issues of stance equi-
librium or stability, primarily establishes results which will
be useful below. Given a stance for the Þrst (n?1) joints,
and a desired end-effector velocity, V
WE
, for the n
th
ma-
nipulating limb, the goal is to Þnd the minimum norm joint
velocities that exactly move the end-effector at this desired
velocity. This problem is exactly analogous to the classical
minimum norm redundancy resolution solution, except that
the different kinematic constraint between the end-effector
and the robotÕs joints yield a solution with slightly different
algebraic form. Formally, we seek the solution to the problem

B. Problem #2: The Task Priority Solution
This problem is motivated by the classical Task Priority
solution for redundant robot manipulators [19]. The goal is to
require the manipulator limbÕs end-effector to track a desired
velocity, and as a second priority, have the center of mass
move as closely as possible in a desired directionÐone that
presumably maintains or enhances stance stability.

It follows that for the problem to be feasible, i.e., that the
center of mass velocity can be exactly tracked, the stance
map must be full rank (the robot is wrench-resistant), and
there must exists some x ?R

Of course, the priorities can be reversed, and the same
solution used by changing indices.
This solution could be useful in the following way. Let the
desired center of mass velocity,
÷
V
A
C
, be speciÞed as a unit
vector pointing away from the nearest face of the support
polygon (into the interior of the polygon). Then, solution (19)
will track the desired end-effector velocity, if at all possible,
while attempting to maintain, or even enhance, the stanceÕs
margin.
C. Problem #3: The Balanced Priority Solution
In many situations, it may be difÞcult to track the desired
manipulation trajectory, while also maintaining stability, and
minimizing joint motions. Hence, in practice it makes sense
to deÞned a weighted optimization goal that blends the
priorities of tracking, stance, and joint motions:

This is an equality constrained quadratic program (ECQP),
and it is easy to show that it has a unique solution whenever
?, ?, ? ³ 0 and F has full row rank. Geometrically, the
solution is a projection of the vector b onto the null-space
of F. The nature of the projection is deÞned by the matrix
P above; when the weights are nonzero but equal, then the
projection is orthogonal. When the weights are non-zero but
not equal, the projection is oblique Ñ it is stretched along
components of x and b with large weights, and shrunk along
the components with small weights. The problem sometimes
has solutions when weights are set to zero, in these cases
the solution though correct is useless as the corresponding
variable is shrunk to zero.
The solution to this problem can be computed explicitly
by enforcing the KKT optimality conditions. Strong duality
holds in this case whenever the problem is feasible, and the
optimal x

can be obtained by solving the dual problem. Let

provides the following guarantee: provided there is no local
motion that keeps the end effector and the center of mass
stationary, (21) has a unique solution. It is very unlikely
that such motion exists.

D. Possible Extensions
Using the relationships derived in this paper, and starting
from the formulations in the Þrst part of this section, one
can extend these approaches to incorporate many other issues
into the local motion planning problem. For example, it is
known that quasi-statical equilibrium postures of a multi-
legged robot lie inside a vertical prism, whose boundary can
be approximated to arbitrary precision as a polytope. Thus,
one could formulate this constraint in the form:
AV
A
C
c. (22)
This constraint, coupled with Equation (21), yields a convex
quadratic problem which is practically solvable. Note that
the presence of obstacles can also be formulated in the style
of Equation (22), with the end-effector velocity substituted
for the center of mass velocity, allowing for the end-effector
to simultaneously avoid obstacle while carrying out its ma-
nipulator task.
VI. EXAMPLES
We consider a planar 3-limbed robot, somewhat analgous
to Robosimian, shown in Þgure 3. This simple robot can
walk quasi-staically, maintaining a support region with non-
zero width. We assume the robot stands on point contacts
with friction. The limb links all have mass equal to one
tenth that of the abdomen. We consider two different mo-
tions, one largely translating the end-effector left/right, and
one translating the end-effector verticaly. The end-effector
and mass center motions produced by the minimum norm
solution and the balanced priority solution (the equality
constrained quadratic programming approach), with priority
weights ?=20, ? =50, ? = 200 are compared. These
examples are kinematically simulated.
6
The simulations use a simple controller: the robot repeat-
edly adjusts its joint angles byÔC??

, where?? is suggested
by the particular optimization based on the direction to the
goal, and C is a scaling coefÞcient that reduces monoton-
ically as the end effector reaches the goal. In reality, we
imagine that a trajectory curve from the start to Þnish would
be speciÞed for the end effector (and perhaps the center of
mass if the ECQP method is being used) the end-effector
(resp. center of mass) would servo about this trajectory by
matching the tangent at every step.
The results are shown in Þgure 4. In each case, the robotÕs
initial conÞguration is shown in black, intermediate positions
are green, and the Þnal position is blue. The end-effector
trajectory is shown in red, and the center of mass motion is
given by a solid streak of black circles. It is evident that the
QP method results in smooth motion of both end-effector and
center-of-mass. The minimum norm solution moves towards
the goal more aggressively, jerking the center of mass and
end-effector. The QP method results in a much smaller net
deviation of the center of mass than the minimum norm
approach.
6
Whereas in reality the robot would maintain contact due to physics,
here we ensure that applied joint-angle changes lie in the null-space of the
Jacobian of the structure equation (see [23]).

VII. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
This paper provided a framework for planning with multi-
limbed robots during tasks that combine quasistatic balance
and reach. The kinematics that govern the relationship be-
tween joint velocities and the velocity of a given point on the
robot are provided. The motion of the center of mass is also
explained, through the derivation of the stance-constrained
center of mass Jacobian. The derived results are very general,
and can be applied to any robot on almost any terrain.
We also developed local motion planning methods that are
analogous to classical redundancy resolution methods, but
adapted for the more complex kinematic relationships which
describe the motions of these mechanisms. Ongoing work
aims to implement this framework on the RoboSimian robot.
Issues related to forces, including the formal statement of
static equilibrium follow very naturally from this work, as
wrenches and twists are dual. These issues will be explored
deeply in forthcoming work.
