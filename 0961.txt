A robust landing and sliding maneuver controller
for a quadrotor vehicle on a sloped incline
David Cabecinhas, Rita Cunha and Carlos Silvestre
Abstract— This work addresses the design and experimental
evaluation of a robust controller for a quadrotor landing
maneuver comprising the approach to a landing slope and
sliding on that slope, before coming to a complete halt. During
the critical landing ﬂight phase the dynamics of the vehicle
change with the type of contact with the ground and a hybrid
automaton, whose states reﬂect the several dynamic behaviors of
the quadrotor, is employed to model the vehicle throughout the
complete maneuver. The quadrotor landing problem is broken
down into separate maneuver generation and robust trajectory
tracking problems, which are combined to achieve a successful
maneuver that is robust to possible uncertainties. Experimental
results are provided to attest the feasibility of the proposed
landing procedure.
I. INTRODUCTION
Flight control and applications of Unmanned Aerial Ve-
hicles (UA V) is an active and challenging topic of research,
with crucial importance to numerous civilian and military
applications. Examples of applications can be gathered from
a number of recent journal special issues dedicated to these
platforms, with topics ranging from the ﬂight control [1]
and aerial robotics [2] to a plethora of remote sensing
applications, such as the ones detailed in [3]. Research on
autonomous UA Vs has been traditionally focused on the free
ﬂight regime, where the vehicle is completely airborne and
performs hover or forward ﬂight maneuvers. However, in
many envisaged working scenarios, an aerial vehicle must
also perform the challenging take-off and landing maneuvers,
where the vehicle is in contact with the ground and additional
complications arise.
Early research work with experimental results for landing
maneuvers considered horizontal ﬂat and stable landing
surfaces. The more challenging problem of landing an au-
tonomous helicopter on an oscillating platform, such as the
deck of a ship at sea, was considered in [4]. In this work the
authors devise an inner-model based control solution, based
on the assumption that the vertical oscillation is the result of
the superposition of sinusoids of unknown amplitude, phase
and frequency. More recently, a landing controller able to
cope with a landing platform that is moving vertically with
unknown dynamics was developed in [5], where landing is
achieved based on optical ﬂow measurements. The related

problem of landing on a horizontally moving platform was
studied in [6], where the authors tackle the problem of
landing the vehicle resorting to an inner-outer loop control
strategy with the attitude as the inner-loop reference.
Non-traditional approaches to landing have been devel-
oped in [7] and [8], where solutions for landing aerial
vehicles by perching on vertical walls are studied. More
recently, particular emphasis has been payed to other ﬂight
conditions where controlled interaction with the environment
occurs, whether it is contact with vertical walls, the ground
or even using an arm-like extension to interact with ob-
jects [9], [10]. The use of a VTOL vehicle to apply forces
to the environment while maintaining ﬂight stability was
proposed in [11]. Similarly, in [9] a quadrotor vehicle is ﬁtted
with an arm, which is used to interact with the environment.
Further exploration of ﬂight modes were physical contact
with the environment occurs as can be found in [12], which
focuses on the interaction of a ducted-fan aerial vehicle with
a vertical surface, where sliding is allowed.
In this paper, we build on the ideas developed in [13]
and [10] and propose a hybrid ﬂight controller that ensures
a successful completion of a landing maneuver, from a free
ﬂight conﬁguration to a complete halt, for a quadrotor vehicle
in challenging circumstances. In the spirit of [13], a hybrid
automata is used to model the vehicle, thereby encapsulating
the complete dynamics of the different ﬂight regimes it
must transverse. Once the hybrid automaton is deﬁned, the
landing problem is addressed as a combination of trajectory
generation and trajectory tracking control problems. In par-
ticular, both the reference signals and the feedback laws for
each operating mode are derived considering explicitly the
presence of uncertainties. The references are designed such
that their practical, and not perfect, tracking ensures that the
desired transitions happen, despite the possible presence of
uncertainties.
II. PROBLEM STATEMENT
The main objective of the paper is the development of a
controller for an aircraft that robustly ensures a successful
completion of a landing maneuver on an inclined plane,
from a free ﬂight conﬁguration to a complete halt. A control
solution is proposed for a quadrotor vehicle actuated in
force, generated by the propellers, allowing for full torque
control and generating a total force aligned this the propeller
direction. The full state of the quadrotor is assumed to be
known and available for feedback by controller.
A quadrotor aircraft is actuated in force, generated by the
four propellers, and possesses hover and VTOL (vertical

III. QUADROTOR HYBRID MODEL
The quadrotor is modeled as a hybrid automaton with ﬁve
operating modes, corresponding each mode to the different
dynamics that the vehicle is subject to. The modes are
distinguished by the number of contact points of the landing
gear with the ground and the existence of relative movement
between the contact point and the ground. In the Free Flight
(FF) mode, the quadrotor is in free ﬂight and no contact
with the landing slope occurs. The operating modes Take-
off-and-Landing (TL and TLs) denote a take-off or landing
situation where there exists a single contact point between
the quadrotor and the ground. The shorthand notation TL
denotes the non-sliding situation and TLs the take-off-and-
landing mode where sliding exists between the quadrotor and
the ground. Lastly, the Landed (LL and LLs) operating mode
corresponds to having the landing gear in full contact with
the ground, with both points A and B touching the landing
slope. Likewise, we denote by LL the non-sliding situation
and by LLs the landing operative mode where the quadrotor
slides on the ground. The coordinates of CM in thefIg
reference frame are denoted by (x;z) and the coordinates of
the contact point A expressed in thefLg frame are denoted
by (;). To simplify the mathematical descriptions of the
various quadrotor dynamics, the state of the quadrotor is
expressed in different coordinate systems, according to its
operative mode.
A. Hybrid model of the quadrotor dynamics
A description of the overall quadrotor dynamics is ob-
tained by means of a hybrid automaton whose states corre-
spond to the different operating modes. A hybrid automaton
is identiﬁed by the following objects, instanced here for the
speciﬁc case of the planar quadrotor.
1) Operating Modes: The quadrotor automaton com-
prises the set Q of operating modes, denoted by Q =
fLL; LLs; TL; TLs; FFg, with the meaning landed,
landed sliding, take-off and landing, take-off and landing
sliding, and free ﬂight, respectively.
2) Domain map: The state of the system  2 R
6
is
described by either (x; _ x;z; _ z;;
_
) or (; _ ;;
_
;;
_
) co-
ordinates. When the UA V is in contact with the ground
(LL, LLs, TL, and TLs operating modes), the preferred
reference frame is fLg frame and the state described by
 = (; _ ;;
_
;;
_
). For the free ﬂight operating mode we
use framefIg and the state  = (x; _ x;z; _ z;;
_
).
3) Flow map: The ﬂow map f : Q  R
6

R
2
! R

describes for each operating mode q 2
fLL;LLs;TL;TLs;FFg the evolution of the state vari-
ables. In each operating modeq we have the dynamic system
_
 =f(q;;u); (1)
where each functionf(q;;u) is derived from the differential
equations that govern the movement of the quadrotor vehicle.
For further detail on their deﬁnition the reader is directed
to [10], where the derivation of the quadrotor dynamics for
the several operating modes can be found.
4) Edges: The set of edgesEQQ includes all the
pairs(q
1
;q
2
) such that a transition between the modesq
1
and
q
2
is possible, for some combination of state and actuation.
For the take-off and landing procedures, we consider the
transitions depicted in Fig. 2. Direct edges linking LL to FF
or FF to LL are not modeled as these suffer from robustness
issues and are not used for the maneuvers. Nonetheless,
these transitions can be equivalently obtained by considering
sequential instantaneous transitions through the intermediate
operative modes TL and TLs.
5) Guard mapping: The set-valued guard mappingG :
ER

determines, for each edge (q

;q
2
)2E, the set
G(fq

;q
2
g) to which the quadrotor state and inputsF
1
; F
2
,
must belong so that a transition from q
1
to q
2
can occur.
There are three main groups of transitions to consider for
the landing procedure. First, the operating mode transitions
between free ﬂight and the TLs operating mode depend on
the force perpendicular to the slope F

Second, the transitions where the quadrotor goes from a state
with one contact point (TL and TLs operating modes) to two
contact points (LL, LLs) are governed by the sign of the

and by the angle of the vehicle with the slope,  +. The
inverse transition depends only on the sign of F

. Last,
we have the transitions between the at rest and the sliding
modes, which are governed by the relation between the force
along the slope at the contact point, the perpendicular force
F
?
, and the vehicle’s velocity along the slope _ . For the
detailed expressions of the guard sets the reader is referred
to [10].

identiﬁes
the jump of the state variable  during the operating mode
transition fromq

toq
2
. The only reset maps that result from
physical interaction are the ones governing the transitions
from FF to TLs and TL to LL. In particular, for reference tra-
jectory generation, we model the mapR(fTL;LLg;(;u))
under the assumption of an inelastic collision and the map
R(fFF;TLsg;(;u)) is modeled under the assumption of
inelastic impact along the perpendicular of the landing slope
and by considering energy conservation – see among others
[14]. This results in a trivial transition from TL to LL. The
transition from Free Flight to the TLs operating mode is more
complex and is analyzed in the sequel. The kinetic energy of
the vehicle, ignoring the constant lateral velocity along the
slope, before and after the impact is given respectively by

IV. ROBUST CONTROL STRATEGY AND ARCHITECTURE
With the hybrid automaton in hand, the problem of
performing a landing maneuver can be reformulated as a
problem of changing the operative mode q from the initial
free ﬂight mode FF to the ﬁnal landed conﬁguration LL,
by going through the intermediate states. The sequence of
operating modes for the landing maneuver is chosen as FF,
TLs, TL and ﬁnally LL, for which the transitions can be
achieved robustly.
Following the general framework proposed in [13], the
control problem is divided into two different steps. The ﬁrst
step amounts to computing, for each of the three desired
transitions (FF ! TLs, TLs! TL and TL! LL) ,
reference trajectories for both the states and the inputsu of
the system, jointly denoted as reference maneuvers. For each
operating modeq2Q, the reference maneuvers are designed
to guarantee robustness with respect to a design parameter
 > 0, meaning that practical tracking of the reference
trajectories, up to a tracking error (in both state and input),
ensures that only the desired transition is achieved. The
second step consists of designing feedback control laws for
each operating mode guaranteeing that, for the proposed
reference maneuvers and despite parametric uncertainties and
exogenous disturbances, the tracking error (both in the state
and in the input) is upper bounded by the design parameter
, so that the planned transition is enforced.
A. Robust Reference Maneuvers
To precisely deﬁne the maneuvers of interest, we denote by

q
(t) = ((t);u(t)) a maneuver taking place in the operating
mode q2Q and by gr
q
the graph of the maneuver in a
certain time interval. We now present multiple straightfor-
ward robust approach trajectories whose practical following
leads the quadrotor from free ﬂight to a ﬁnal landed position
in a controlled manner. The maneuvers are parameterized by
their starting conditions and are combined to generate the
robust transition maneuvers, according to [13].
The proposed complete landing maneuver is depicted in
Figure 3. The landing procedure starts in free ﬂight, where
a horizontal landing path is tracked. This eventually leads
to a collision with the sloped ground, at which instant the
supervisor selects the TLs controller and starts tracking a
reference maneuver that leads the quadrotor to the TL state.
The quadrotor then slides up the slope, tracking a TLs to
TL trajectory, until it comes to a halt at a desired location.
Upon coming to a halt, the quadrotor transitions to the TL
operating mode mode and the supervisor uses the TL low-
level controller to track a TL to LL trajectory that ﬁnally
levels the quadrotor with the ground, without starting to
slide again. Once all the landing gear contact points touch
the ground and the ﬁnal transition to the Landed mode
is complete, the motors are turned off and the quadrotor
remains at rest.

1) FF! TLs robust transition maneuver: For taking the
aircraft from free ﬂight to the takeoff-and-landing sliding
operating mode we propose a maneuver that leads to the
quadrotor sliding up. This maneuver is chosen to have a
minimal impact on the quadrotor upon touchdown on the
landing slope. The quadrotor is chosen to track a horizontal
line at a constant velocity until the contact point A of the
landing gear touches the landing slope. For the quadrotor
model at hand, the reference maneuver is deﬁned as

; y

and initial time t

2 R. The positive velocity corresponds
to a landing maneuver where the quadrotor lands from the
lower side of the slope. This maneuver ensures that only
one of the quadrotor’s landing gear hits the slope and that the
quadrotor starts to slide on the ground, forcing a transition to
the TLs mode, if tracked with an error smaller than . The
time instant at which the transition occurs depends on the
location of the slope, the quadrotor initial position (x
0
;y
0
)
and the lateral approach velocity v
y
.
2) TLs ! TL robust transition maneuver: Following
Figure 3, in the TLs operating mode the quadrotor tracks
a straight line along the slope and decreases its velocity,
until it comes to a halt. We deﬁne a reference maneuver
with constant acceleration for the contact point and a ﬁxed
tilt angle as follows

are obtained by dynamic inversion of vehicle model. A set
of maneuvers with different initial condition parameters at
the initial time instant t
0
is considered so as to cover the
whole region of possible initial conditions that arises when
the tracking of the preceding maneuver is not perfect. The
tilt angle 
0
that the quadrotor follows while sliding should
be slightly positive so that the quadrotor is able to slide
along the slope robustly, without returning to the free ﬂight
operating mode. The transition to TL occurs when _  = 0.
3) TL ! LL robust transition maneuver: Once the
quadrotor comes to a halt, the objective is to bring it to
the slope level, without inducing a sliding movement again.
In this operating mode we are only interested in controlling
the tilt angle, for which we deﬁne the reference trajectory

, which is chosen to converge from its initial
value down to zero. In order for the maneuver to be robust,
the balance between T
?
(t) and 
?
(t) must be such that the
vehicle is always -far from restarting to slide during the
whole transition maneuver. For the duration of this transition
maneuver, the displacement of the landing gear contact point
is constant, i.e. (t) =
0
.
B. Single operating mode controllers
In this section we describe the controllers employed in
each operating mode to drive the vehicle along the desired
transition trajectories, in order to achieve a successful landing
maneuver. These are based on previous works by the authors,
namely [15] and [10], wherein locally Input-to-State-Stable
(ISS) controllers (see [16] for a deﬁnition) for free ﬂight
and for the operating modes where contact occurs have been
developed. Each of the controllers is required to stabilize
the closed-loop system, for the appropriate dynamics, in
a practical sense. From this follows that, despite possible
disturbances and perturbations, the maneuver tracking error
remains within a distance of the reference maneuver, there-
fore culminating in an successful operating mode transition.
1) Free ﬂight controller: To steer the vehicle in free
ﬂight we use the backstepping controller developed in [15],
restricted to a two dimensional setup. The state feedback
controller imbues the error system with a Lyapunov func-
tion with strictly negative derivative, resulting a closed-
loop system that is locally ISS with respect to the external
disturbances considered for the free ﬂight regime at the force
level. As a direct consequence, there exists a maximum
disturbance bound for which it can be ensured that the
maneuver error is within the required limits.
2) Takeoff-and-landing controllers: The control law for
the TLs dynamics is a proportional-derivative controller
chosen as

the reference maneuver) and uniquely deﬁne the quadrotor’s
input forces F
1
(t) and F
2
(t). As shown in [10], the control
parameters can be tuned so that the closed-loop trajectory
remains -close to the robust reference maneuver provided
that the initial error and the uncertainty in the friction coef-
ﬁcient are sufﬁciently small. A similar controller is used for
the non-sliding situation where just the quadrotor angle  is
controlled through (3b), with the input forcesF

2
(t)
526
being deﬁned uniquely deﬁned by the additional speciﬁcation
of the desired resulting total force T(t) =F
1
(t)+F
2
(t).
3) Landed mode: The landed state is the goal state of
the landing maneuver. As such, in the operation mode the
objective is to have the propellers of the vehicle come to a
full halt, which is attained by setting both quadrotor forces
to zero once the quadrotor is leveled with the landing slope,
to prevent further movement. To avoid a large discontinuity
in force input, we consider a maximum rate of variation for
the propeller input and deﬁne the control law as
F
1
(t) = max(F
1
(0) t;0);
F
2
(t) = max(F
2
(0) t;0);
where the positive parameter is the rate of variation of the
thrust force.
C. Supervisor
The supervisor orchestrates the switch of the low-level
controllers and drives them with the appropriate reference
maneuver according to the actual state of the vehicle. In
order to apply the hybrid robust control strategy, we start
by designing four robust reference maneuvers (

some ﬁxed  and respective operative mode. Subsequently,
with the reference maneuvers and ﬁxed, we ﬁx the four low-
level controllers according to the structures and the design
principles speciﬁed in Section IV-B. Let u

be the control laws discussed in Section IV-B for each of
the operating modes. The supervisor logic switches the low-
level controller according to the actual stateq(t) of the vehi-
cle. The latter takes values in the setfFF; TLs; TL; LLg
and it is supposed to be known by combining measurements
from sensors, either external or appropriately placed in the
quadrotor airframe. The supervisor logic is thus simply
u(t) =u
q(t)
(t).
V. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
In this section we present the results for an experimental
run of the proposed hybrid controller. The vehicle used for
the experiments is a radio controlled Blade mQX quadro-
tor [17] and a VICON Bonita motion capture system [18]
to obtain position and orientation measurements for the
aircraft as well as an estimate for the linear velocity. The
inputs for the quadrotor used in this experiment do not
include each motor force individually, thereby preventing
the straightforward experimental testing of the theoretical
framework. To overcome this issue, the

 angular dynamics
are integrated in simulation using the appropriate ﬂow map
(1) computed for the current quadrotor state and inputs F
1
andF
2
coming from the low level controllers. The resulting
angular velocity
_
 and the total thrust are then used as inputs
for the physical quadrotor. This setup is depicted in Figure 4.
To adapt the physical setup to a 2D control setting, the
quadrotor is restricted to a vertical plane along the slope and

its yaw is kept such that two of its landing gear contact points
point in the slope direction, as shown in Figure 5. For the
proposed maneuver, the quadrotor lands from the left to the
right, relative to the ﬁgure, keeping the yaw angle such that
both the right side contact points touch the slope at the same
time. Landing with a correct yaw angle allows the quadrotor
to tilt and continue in the same 2D plane, allowing for a
good approximation of a 2D setting.

For the landing procedure, the reference trajectory consists
of a sequence of robust approach maneuvers FF!TLs,
TLs!TL, and TL!LL, resulting in the vehicle sliding up
the slope and coming to a halt at the desired landing point.
The tracking of the quadrotor displacement and tilt angle
is presented in Figures 6 and 7. The ﬁgures are divided
in four sections, corresponding to the four operation states
transversed, with each one being labeled FF, TLs, TL or LL
according to the respective operating mode. The transition
to TLs occurs around 8 s and at 11.5 s the quadrotor stops
sliding and enters the TL state. Finally, around 12 s the
quadrotor has two points of contact with the ground and
enters the LL state, completing the landing procedure.
With an eye on Figure 6 we can see the effects of the
initial impact with the slope at the 8 s. The quadrotor starts
an initial slide along the slope but looses velocity. This
velocity is quickly recovered as the quadrotor tries to track

the desired maneuver. Finally, the quadrotor comes to a halt
and a transition to TL occurs, with the landed state being
attained shortly after. Despite all the uncertainties existing in
the model, the controller proves to be robust and maintains
the tracking error small.
Looking at Figure 7, we see the time evolution of of the
quadrotor’s tilt angle. In free ﬂight the angle is approximately
zero, as asserted in the reference maneuver discussion in
Section IV-A.1. Once in TLs, the quadrotor tracks a reference
maneuver where

. This tilt angle is close enough to
the initial angle and confers increased controllability to the
quadrotor. Additionally, it helps to avoid a return to free ﬂight
situation, as could happen easily if the reference maneuver
was deﬁned with 
0
= 0. Once the TL state is entered,
the quadrotor tries to follow a constant angular velocity
trajectory that leads to all of the landing gear being in contact
with the landing slope.
VI. CONCLUSIONS
This paper addressed the problem of robust landing control
of a quadrotor UA V , considering explicitly the interaction
with the ground, that guarantees successful maneuvers even
in sloped terrains and in the presence of external disturbances
and uncertain parameters. The vehicle was modeled as a
hybrid automaton, whose states reﬂect the different dynamic
behaviors exhibited by the UA V along the stages of the
landing maneuver. The landing procedure was then cast as
the problem of changing the operating mode of the vehicle
from the initial to the ﬁnal desired state, through the edge
transitions allowed for the hybrid automaton. The transi-
tions between intermediate operating modes were achieved
through the application of low-level feedback controllers,
associated with each mode, to track robust reference signals.
A supervisor controller was designed to sense the current
operation mode of the vehicle and choose the appropriate
low-level controller and robust transition reference trajectory.
The combined properties of the low-level controllers and
reference trajectories ensures that the desired intermediate
transitions are attained robustly with respect to uncertainties
in the model and environment parameters and that the ﬁnal
desired state is reached. Experimental results using a small
scale radio controlled quadrotor vehicle were presented to
assess the feasibility of the proposed hybrid controller.
