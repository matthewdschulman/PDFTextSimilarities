AbstractÑ In this work, we reformulate our previously devel-
oped strategy for operating unknown constrained mechanisms,
to Þt our new task speciÞcation framework for indirect force
controlled robots, which we presented recently. The main
improvement is a signiÞcant reduction of erroneous forces,
which is achieved by breaking the manipulation task down
into a hierarchical set of subtasks instead of having interfering
tasks. The improvement is evaluated by conducting a series of
manipulation experiments using the old and new approach and
comparing the average erroneous forces.
I. MOTIVATION
Many approaches for constrained manipulation in unstruc-
tured environments focus on modeling the constraint and
estimate the model parameters as good as possible, e.g.
[1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6]. Active interaction forces, which
are required to move along the constrained trajectory are
often not considered and these approaches are limited by the
underlying model of the constraint. Also, external sensors
like vision or laser scanners are often used, which introduce
an additional source of uncertainty and make the complete
system often quite complicated.
Approaches which use simple models and rely only on
internal sensing (position- and force sensors) often assume
orthogonal velocity and force subspaces, neglecting poten-
tially required interaction forces (active forces). Examples
of such approaches are [7], [8], [9], where only little active
forces are postulated.
In [10] and [11] a desired force has to be predeÞned, what
can be problematic for changing required interaction forces,
e.g. for latch mechanisms like a microwave door.
In [12] a compliant manipulator is used to pull open doors
and drawers. The control goal is to follow the constraint
trajectory with the manipulators end effector without consid-
ering the actually applied interaction forces. The compliance
is used to compensate for uncertainties. This method is im-
proved by learning the kinematics of the operated mechanism
in [13].
Karayiannidis et al. proposed a new velocity controller
with force feedback to open revolute and prismatic doors
and drawers [14], [15]. While stable execution of the task is
proven, the well-known potential risk of contact instability
when applying force feedback is not discussed.

Previously, we proposed a set point generator for indirect
force controllers (IFC) in order to operate constrained mech-
anisms [16]. By using an underlying IFC control scheme,
we avoid to design another force controller and instead
rely on a well-established and stable control scheme. The
major drawback of this approach was, that force and position
regulation was realized as two interfering tasks and some
gain tuning had to be done to obtain satisfactory results for
both tasks.
In [17] we proposed a task speciÞcation approach for set
point regulation for IFC controlled robots which allowed
the independent regulation of static interaction forces and
positioning on joint and Cartesian level. The present work
shows how to adapt the strategy, developed in [16] for this
framework.
The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Some
theoretical basics are recapitulated in section II. In section
III, a short review of our previous strategy [16] is given and
we show how it can be reformulated for our new framework.
The results are presented in IV and a brief summary is given
in V.
II. THEORETICAL BACKGROUND
A. Manipulator Representation
The very basics of robotic manipulation are assumed to
be known, hence only the relations directly in connection
to the present work are summarized. The conÞguration
of a manipulator with n degrees of freedom is uniquely
determined by a set of n generalized coordinates q. For
revolute joints q are the joint angles. The end effector pose

can be denoted by a vector x = [p o]

with the three
dimensional positionp = [x y z]
T
and orientationo, where
the dimension and unit ofo depend on the chosen orientation
representation, e.g. for Þxed angleso = [? ? ?]
T
, where
?, ? and ? are the rotation angles around the x-,y- and z?
axis of the root frame.
For the Þxed angle representation, ú x = [ú p ?]
T
denotes
the generalized end effector velocity, or twist, with ú p?R

and ? ? R

, representing the translational and angular
velocity of the end effector. The base Jacobian J states the
transformation between joint velocities ú q and the twist:
J(q) =

. (1)
Dependencies on q will be omitted for the sake of read-
ability. With (1) the instantaneous inverse kinematics can be
inferred using a generalized inverse (e.g. the Moore-Penrose
pseudoinverse) of the Jacobian:

B. Indirect Force Control
Indirect force control is characterized by regulating the
conÞguration of a virtual manipulator, represented by its
generalized coordinates q
v
. The relation of this virtual
manipulator to the physical manipulator q is stated via
a virtual mechanical relationship (see Fig. 2), established
either at Cartesian or joint-level. What all joint space IFC
schemes have in common, is that they state a virtual stiffness
relationship between the position difference (q
v
?q) and ap-
plied joint torque? via a stiffness matrixK. By determining
a set-point q
v
, the static interaction torque
? =K(q
v
?q) (4)
is indirectly induced. A common approach is to use a velocity
interface ú q
v
to regulate the IFC controlled manipulator.
C. Hierarchical Force and Position Regulation for IFC Con-
trolled Robots

ing tasks, using a uniform task variable ??R

tasks m = 6 while for joint space tasks m =n. Notice that
we consider only the static interaction torques and forces
due to the stiffness relation (4). Also, when stating position
regulation we are referring to the virtual conÞguration q

Having a general task controller (7), a hierarchical con-
troller can be derived using nullspace projection methods to
enforce a strict task hierarchy among a set of k subtasks

of the kernel of a general linear map X, an orthogonal

With i as the task iterator and the projector

III. CONSTRAINED MANIPULATION VIA HIERARCHICAL
TASK SPECIFICATION FOR IFC
In this section we adapt our constraint manipulation strat-
egy from [16] to suit the new task speciÞcation approach
from [17]. First, the previous strategy is recapitulated, than
we show how it can be reformulated in compliance with our
new framework by breaking the manipulation task down to
a hierarchical set of subtasks (see Fig. 1 for an exemplary
task).
A. Review of the Previous Approach
In [16] a Þrst order constraint estimator was used to obtain
an estimation for the constraint tangent d, what effectively
represents the instantaneous desired direction of interaction
forces. In the following, when usingd, we are referring to the
estimated value and are not introducing an extra variable for
the sake of readability. The constraint was assumed affecting
only the translational degrees of freedom, henced?R
3
and
||d|| = 1. An exploratory force along d was induced, by
incrementing the joint space set point q
v
with a discrete
exploration term

?T (9)
with?> 0 as the desired slope of the force alongd, denoting
the rate of the exploration and having the unit N/s. The
sampling time of the discrete controller is denoted by ?T .
To keep the interaction force aligned with d, q

projected on d

When using (9) this projection kept the interaction mo-
ments equal to zero. To regulate the orientation, a propor-
tional orientation regulator
?q


?T (11)
was imposed and added to (10), with ÷ o = o
d
? o
v
as
the orientation error and ? as a constant positive factor,
regulating ÷ o to 0.
The major problem with this approach is that (11) is
interfering with the main force task pursued by (10). This
is resolved by separating the force and positioning task
in a hierarchical way, as realized in our task speciÞcation
framework for indirect force controlled robots ([17]).
B. Constraint Exploration
First, the exploration regulator (10) has to be reformulated
as a force task to Þt our framework. Hence, the primary
task type is end effector wrench, which has to be formulated
to keep the exploratory nature of (10). This is achieved by
incrementing the currently applied interaction force by the
constant ??T along d. The according subspace matrix S
1
has to reduce the task to the translational degrees of freedom.
Hence,

is the orthogonal projection of the currently applied static
interaction forces f =J

?q) on the estimated
constraint tangentd. The second term induces an exploratory
force alongd with slope ?. A visualization of this action is
provided in Fig. 3. This strategy makes sure, that the exerted
force automatically adjusts itself to the required interaction
force of the operated mechanism while erroneous forces are
reduced (see [16] for details).
C. Orientation Regulation
Having the constraint exploration on the top level, regu-
lation of the orientation can be treated in any desired way,
since it will be executed in the nullspace of the exploration
task. For example, if the end effector is supposed to hold its
initial orientation o

be

ponents of a Cartesian subspace matrix from end-effector to

. For convenience, both tasks ?

is more crucial than the
orientation around x
ee
and y
ee
due to the shape of the
end effector

and has higher priority in case the orientation
subtask can not be fulÞlled completely.
Assuming a caging grasp, another possibility for an orien-
tation regulator can be deÞned, which would permit rotations
around y
ee
. This direction could than be used by lower
priority tasks. This orientation task would be speciÞed with

what shifts the rotational degree of freedom around y

to
the nullspace of the manipulator with respect to that task.
D. Remaining Degrees of Freedom
The rest of the manipulators degrees of freedom can be
used in order to fulÞll any standard manipulation nullspace
task. For example, keeping the joints away from their limits
(task type: joint position) or minimizing joint torques (task
type: joint torques). Suppose, the manipulator kinematics
are deÞned so that q = 0 denotes the conÞguration, which
maximizes the distance of each joint to its limit, the desired
task variable and subspace matrix for both examples would

IV. RESULTS
For the experimental evaluation we used our KUKA
lightweight arm, running a joint space impedance control.
Details on the controller can be found in [18]. The task is
lifting a 1.2kg mass to a height of 0.3m, constrained to a
linear trajectory (pulling a drawer in vertical direction, see

due to slippage. A screwing motion (rotation around zee )
however would directly induce moments at the end effector and could lead
to its damage.

Fig. 4). To compare the previous and our new approach
independent from the constraint estimation, we induced a
constant estimation (d = (?1 0 0)
T
) which corresponds
basically to the real direction of motion. However, erroneous
forces still appear, especially for faster motions. This is
due to unconsidered dynamic effects in combination with
a not perfectly rigid constraint (slippage of grasp, play in
the drawer mechanism), which lead to a deviation of the end
effector from the straight line.
For the new and the old approach, we conducted 9 ma-
nipulations with varying stiffnessK and varying exploration
rate?. To quantify the increased performance when using the
task speciÞcation framework compared to our old approach,
we compared the root mean square (RMS) of the magnitude
of the erroneous forces||f
?
||, deÞned as the passive forces,
which are orthogonal to the constraint direction. The effects
of different stiffness and exploration rate parameters are
discussed in Þgures 5 and 6. Both show ||f
?
|| for two
samples of each approach. With the orientation task no longer
interfering with the force task, the overall RMS of||f
?
|| for
the experiments with Þxed estimation d, was reduced from
0.58N to 0.17N, which corresponds to a reduction of 70%.
For a more qualitative comparison, we also did 6 trials
using the simple velocity Þlter from [16] as constraint esti-
mator. As expected, we obtained an even higher performance
gain, as the reduced erroneous forces lead to a decreased
estimation error, what on its part again reduces the erroneous
forces. The RMS was reduced from 11.17N to 1.54N, what
corresponds to a reduction of 86%.
V. CONCLUSION
We showed how our previous constrained manipulation
strategy could be incorporated in our recently developed task
speciÞcation framework for indirect force controlled robots.
The relative force error is signiÞcantly reduced due to the
clean separation of the subtasks, what was experimentally
evaluated. Besides the usage of a minimal model (constraint
tangent), considering active interaction forces and dispense
with special hardware devices (e.g. tactile sensors), the main
advantage of our approach, is that we do not introduce an-
other control architecture but provide basically an application
for the well studied indirect force control scheme, which has
proven its robustness for physical interaction tasks.

Fig. 6. Pulling the drawer with Þxed stiffness K = 100Nm and varying exploration rate ?. Left: utilizing our new task speciÞcation scheme for IFC
controlled robots. Right: previous approach with conßicting subtasks. The improved performance of the new approach is apparent for lower exploration
rates (? = 5

s
), as dynamic effects are almost not existent and the new task speciÞcation framework generates effectively no erroneous forces. With
a higher exploration rate (? = 15

) also the effective erroneous forces rise slightly, especially in the beginning, where acceleration is higher. For the
previous approach, the induced erroneous forces due to conßicting subtasks are dominating and are not noticeably increased by a higher exploration rate.
