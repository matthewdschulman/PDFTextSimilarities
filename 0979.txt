motorization in China, fatigue driving has become an 
increasingly serious road traffic problem. Driving fatigue 
affects drivers’ alertness, decreasing an individual’s ability to 
operate a vehicle safely and increasing the risk of human error 
that could lead to fatalities, which have been widely recognized 
as critical safety issues that cut across all modes in the 
transportation industry. In this paper, firstly, with a virtual 
driving system we developed, driving simulation experiments 
were designed to collect subjects’ electroencephalogram (EEG) 
signals and mental fatigue data. To detect drivers’ mental state 
in real time, wavelet-packets transform (WPT) was selected to 
extract continuous features; then, the subjective evaluation 
combined with video monitoring was used to evaluate driver’s 
mental state in experiment accurately. At last, with fatigue 
feature as the input and fatigue state as the output, driving 
fatigue detection model can be constructed by classification 
methods. In this paper, Support Vector Machine (SVM) was 
used to build driving fatigue detection model to estimate mental 
fatigue state of EEG signal features, and the binary 
classification accuracy can be achieved up to 88.6207%.

I. INTRODUCTION 
Mental fatigue is a common phenomenon in our daily life, 
and is defined as a state of cortical deactivation, which 
reduces mental performance and decreases alertness [1]. 
According to a report of the American National Highway 
Safety Traffic Administration (NHSTA), driver’s mental 
fatigue was believed to account for 20-30% of all traffic 
accidents [2]. The NHTSA conservatively estimates that 100, 
000 police-reported crashes are caused by drowsy drivers 
each year. That is, about 1.5% of all crashes which is the 
reason why more and more researches are made to build 
automatic detectors of this dangerous state. 
The history of drowsy-driver research can date back to the 
1950s, beginning with studies on aircraft pilots [3]. In the 
1990s, driver fatigue began to be recognized as a major 
concern to both automotive industry and public-safety 
agencies. So far, driving fatigue detection measures include 
subjective evaluation method and objective evaluation 
method. And objective evaluation method can be classified

in terms of their specific techniques [4][5][6]. References [5] 
and [7] have summarized the detection techniques based on: 
1) physiological signals, including pulse rate and EEG; 2) 
physical changes, including changes of head position, 
eye-closure rate, and eyelid movement; 3) driver–vehicle 
data, including steering angle, throttle/brake input, and 
speed. EEG signal contains abundant information and has 
the ability to reflect driver’s mental status, which is the 
reason EEG signal is recognized as the most accurate, the 
objective method to detect driving fatigue. 
Biomedical signals are especially useful to collect detailed 
information of the body’s response during the drowsiness 
cycle. The information that they provide goes beyond the 
usual systems that just detect risky situations (degraded 
driving performance or visual symptoms of lack of 
attention), and can potentially anticipate the onset of 
sleepiness. The major drawback of the techniques based on 
biomedical signals are that they require placing sensors 
directly on the subject’s body, although there are some 
attempts to record them indirectly, through non-intrusive 
systems that could be used in real vehicles [8]. 
An EEG signal is a measurement of currents that flow 
during synaptic excitations of the dendrites of many 
pyramidal neurons in the cerebral cortex. In healthy adults, 
the amplitudes and frequencies of such signals change from 
one state of a human to another, such as wakefulness and 
sleep. The characteristics of the waves also change with age. 
There are five major brain waves distinguished by their 
different frequency ranges. These frequency bands from low 
to high frequencies respectively are called ?, ?, ?, ?, and ? 
[9]. Different studies have been reported on driver 
drowsiness detection including methods identifying 
physiological associations between driver drowsiness/fatigue 
and the corresponding patterns of the electroencephalogram 
(EEG) (brain activity), electrooculogram (EOG) (eye 
movement), and electrocardiogram (ECG) (heart rate) 
signals [10][11][12][13][14]. Most of these studies reported 
that the physiological approach to drowsiness detection can 
provide very accurate results as strong correlation between 
these signals and the driver’s cognitive state was found in 
many studies [15][16]. Specifically, many of these studies 
suggested that the change in the cognitive state can be 
associated with significant changes in the EEG frequency 
bands, such as delta (?: 0~4 Hz), theta (?: 4~8 Hz), alpha (?: 
8~13Hz), and beta (?: 13~20 Hz) [17][18], or their 
combinations [19][20], and with changes in the eyelid 
parameters extracted from the EOG [21].

a brief introduction on the background and motivation in 
Section I, Section II presents the EEG signal processing 
theory, which includes signal preprocessing, feature 
extraction and pattern classification, Section III presents the 
experimental design, which includes a detailed explanation 
of experimental device and objectives, driving simulation 
environment, and experimental process. Then, Section IV 
presents the driving fatigue detection model. The application 
of the driving fatigue detection model to detecting drowsy 
drivers was discussed in Section V. This will be followed by 
some detailed simulated experiments and the corresponding 
data. Section VI summarizes the study and provides future 
research ideas. 
II. EEG SIGNAL PROCESSING METHOD 
A. Data Preprocessing 
Human’s EEG signal is a kind of weak electrical signal. 
Without processing, we will get EEG signals with a variety 
of noise interference. Signals recorded from electrodes will 
be mixed with noises such as: power frequency interference, 
blinks, eye movement artifact, ECG artifact, etc. Therefore, 
in order to meet the requirements of data analysis and 
processing, we should do noise reduction processing to 
original EEG signal at first. 
The EEG signal acquisition devices are EMOTIV EPOC 
that can remove power frequency interference noise and 
ECG artifact automatically, so these noise signals will no 
longer be considered in EEG signal preprocessing section. 
B. Feature Extraction 
Biomedical signals usually consist of brief high-frequency 
components closely spaced in time, accompanied by long 
lasting, low frequency components closely spaced in 
frequency. Wavelets are considered appropriate for 
analyzing such signals as they exhibit good frequency 
resolution along with finite time resolution; the first to 
localize the low-frequency components and the second to 
resolve the high-frequency components [22]. 
The wavelet-packets transform (WPT) was introduced by 
Coifman [23] by generalizing link between multi-resolution 
approximations and wavelets. The WPT may be thought of 
as a tree of subspaces, with Ω
0,0
 representing the original 
signal space, i.e., the root node of the tree. In a general 
notation, the node Ω
j,k
 , with j denoting the scale and k 
denoting the subband index within the scale, is decomposed 
into two orthogonal subspaces: an approximation space Ω
j,k
 
? Ω
j+1,2k
 plus a detail space Ω
j,k 
? Ω
j+1,2k+1
. Divide the 
signal into three layers with wavelet packet decomposition, 
the subspaces are represented as figure 1. This is done by 
dividing the orthogonal basis {?
j
 (t?2
j
 k)}
k? Z
 of Ω
j,k
 into two 
new orthogonal bases {?

 and {?

 , where ?
j,k
 (t) and ?
j,k
(t) are the 
scaling and wavelet functions, respectively, that are given in 
[24]as (1) and (2) shows:

Where, the dilation factor 2
j
, also known as the scaling 
parameter, measures the degree of compression or scaling. 
The location parameter 2
j
 k, also known as translation 
parameter, determines the time location of the wavelet.

There are many studies about how EEG signal will change 
when fatigue driving happens, and it’s generally considered 
that slow wave gradually increase and fast wave gradually 
reduce when drivers’ mental state change from clear-headed 
to fatigue. So the index of fatigue state F can be energy ratio 
of wave ? and slow wave, as (3) shows: 
F =
E

                             (3) 
Since the size of wavelet packet decomposition 
coefficients show the strength of EEG signal, the application 
of expressing the sum of square of wavelet packet 
decomposition coefficient as energy of signals is reasonable. 
We assume d
j
q
 is the j
th
 level and the q
th
 node of wavelet 
packet decomposition coefficient, so the energy of 
reconstructing signal is as follow: 
                                   E
j
q
= (d
j

                              (4) 
According to (3) and (4), the value of F can be obtained. 
C. Pattern Classification 
A support vector machine (SVM) constructs a hyperplane 
or set of hyperplanes in a high-or infinite-dimensional space, 
which can be used for classification, regression, or other 
tasks. Intuitively, a good separation is achieved by the 
hyperplane that has the largest distance to the nearest 
training data point of any class (so-called functional margin), 
since in general the larger the margin the lower the 
generalization error of the classifier. Whereas the original 
problem may be stated in a finite dimensional space, it often 
happens that the sets to discriminate are not linearly 
separable in that space. For this reason, it was proposed that 
the original finite-dimensional space be mapped into a much 
higher-dimensional space, presumably making the 
separation easier in that space [25]. 
SVM is good at dealing with sample data that are linear 
inseparable by Slack Variables and Kernel Function. The

SVM classifier is very concise and it need small amount of 
sample information, which makes it good to bring no trouble 
to storage and computing. 
III. DESIGN OF EXPEIMENT 
A. Experimental Device 
In this paper, we use wireless EEG scanners from 
EMOTIV. Based on the latest neurobiological science, 
EMOTIV developed the new Brain-computer Interaction 
(BCI) device EMOTIV EPOC. EMOTIV EPOC is a wireless 
helmet with a sampling frequency of 128HZ. EMOTIV 
EPOC has 14 sensors, and they are set to international 
standard positions, which are AF3, F7, F3, FC5, T7, P7, O1, 
O2, P8, T8, FC6, F4, F8, and AF4. With these sensors, we 
can detect EEG signals, so as to control and affect other 
equipments with human thought, expression and emotion. 
B. Experimental Objectives 
We have fifteen subjects who are undergraduate students 
in school and they are all male aged between 20 to 24 years 
old. All subjects have no sleep problems and psychological 
problems. They get enough sleep before the experiment and 
they are forbidden to take coffee, tea and mental drugs or eat 
excitant food until the experiment is over. 
C. Virtual Driving System 
This environment is consisted of an automobile founded 
by a Physics Car module in VIRTOOLS and highways with 
surrounding scene by 3DS MAX. In respect that there is no 
requirement for the details of automotive body in the driving 
simulation system, we focus on making cars with real 
physical effect. Based on modifying the Physics Car module, 
we highlight four simulation wheels in VIRTOOLS, two 
wheels act as power output, and the other two wheels as 
control output of direction. 
 
Fig.2. Virtual driving system for driving fatigue detection. 
This paper turn potency dimension and rotation angle into 
floating point numbers from external devices. Because the 
transformation between them is a linear relationship, we can 
easily convert them to corresponding physical quantities in 
virtual driving model. In the model, the accelerator and 
brake are used to control the product of torque and rotational 
speed of the two rear wheels when rotating around 
concentric shaft. In other words, the accelerator and brake 
control the output power of the drive shaft of the two rear 
wheels. The steering wheel is used to control the angle of 
front wheel and rear wheel, implement of rotation to be 
achieved. 
Therefore, this test environment provides an interactive, 
safe and realistic environment at very low cost, and the 
outcomes of this study should be highly applicable to real 
life driving safety research. 
D. Driving Simulation Environment 
In this paper, we use common game steering wheel and 
supporting pedals to simulate driving operation and two 
laptops were used, one to run virtual driving test program as 
a situational screen and capture video to record driver’s 
facial information, the other one to run interface software of 
EMOTIV EPOC to collect EEG data. In the driving 
simulation experiment, subjects operate the driving 
simulation system to drive, and EMOTIV EPOC gathers 
EEG signals of the subjects at the same time. 
 
Fig.3. Driving simulation environment which include EMOTIVE EPOC, 
steering wheel and two laptops to run specific software. 
E. Experimental Process 
We do the experiments in a close and sound insulation 
environment to get rid of external interference. During the 
two-day experiments, all subjects should eat normal and try 
to stay up. In order to obtain driving mental data under 
different physiological states, we conduct the experiment in 
six time points in two days as follows:  
1) When getting up in the morning, the subject feels 
energetic and alert. We do the experiment at 9am. 
2) The subject does mental works such as reading and 
learning until he feels tired and don’t want to continue to 
complete the task. This process repeats until 3 pm. and that’s 
when we perform the experiment.  
3) The subject continues to do mental activity as described 
above and we conduct the experiment around 9 pm. The 
subjects need to stay up all night doing mental works. 
4) Repeat the above 3 steps the next day. 
After each break, every subject is supposed to fill in the 
Stanford Sleepiness Scale (Alertness Test) to evaluate his 
fatigue state. The Stanford Sleepiness Scale is a quick and 
easy way to assess how alert you are feeling by using the 
7-point degree of sleepiness. We acquire data of each state 
for about 1 hours, 10 minutes simulation driving and rest for 
5 minutes. Each subject will take a simulation driving 12 
4039
  
times a day. During the driving simulation process, we 
collect the driver’s EEG signals.  
Table 1 shows the time schedule for one time point, the 
other time point start at 3pm., 9pm. the same day, and 9 am., 
3pm., 9pm. the next day. The experimental process is the 
same as that in Table 1. 
 
IV. DRIVING FATIGUE DETECTION MODEL 
This paper designs a driving fatigue detection model by 
driving simulation experiment. During experiments, we 
collect subject’s EEG signals by EMOTIV EPOC and 
capture subject’s facial expression features by video 
monitoring. By combining subject’s facial features with his 
own subjective evaluation, we can conclude his fatigue state 
at that time. And by preprocessing and extracting the EEG 
signals, we can get subject’s fatigue feature. In the end, with 
fatigue feature F as the input and fatigue state as the output, 
driving fatigue detection model was constructed by SVM. 
Specific content of driving fatigue detection system is 
shown in Fig. 4. 
 
 
 
Fig. 4. Diagram of driving fatigue detection system. With driving fatigue 
detection model and EEG signals as input, we can get driver’s fatigue 
state, so as to aid driving. 
V. SIMULATION AND RESULTS 
To begin with, the state of fatigue is evaluated by alertness 
test and facial expression monitoring. In consideration of 
veracity, only consistent data is used to build the model. 
When valuate fatigue state by recorded video, the evaluation 
criterion is rate of blinking, eyeball activity, head 
movements, yawning frequency, etc. Specific fatigue state 
evaluation standards are as shown in Table 2. 
 
During experiments, driver’s fatigue states were evaluated 
with alertness test and facial features. Table 3 shows the 
experimental results of one group. 
 
The experiment carried out for two days, 12 times of 
simulation driving taking place in one day, and we have 24 
time points in one experiment. As for the relation between 
sleepiness degree by alertness test and facial features mark, 
we define mark 0 equals to sleepiness degree 1 and 2, mark 
1 equals to sleepiness degree 3 and 4, mark 2 equals to 
sleepiness degree 5 to 7. In this way, we can filter some of 
the time points to evaluate fatigue state more accurately.  
In this paper, EEG signal preprocessing is divided into 
two steps. Firstly, we remove EEG signals that are clearly 
noises manually by EEGLAB. Then the signals are limited 
in the range from 0HZ to 30HZ by using Butterworth filter.  
Then, we extract from the original EEG signals 4 kinds of 
rhythm waves by WPT method. Screening after many 
experiments, we choose wavelet typed db10 that is the most 
similar to EEG signals. The sampling frequency of EMOTIV 
EPOC is 128HZ. According to Shannon’s sampling theorem, 
we can conclude that the bandwidth of our EEG signal is 
64HZ. The 4 kinds of rhythm wave range from 0HZ to 
30HZ, so we set decomposition layer of wavelet packet 
transform method 6 layers. After wavelet packet 
decomposition, we get 64 sub bands. Each node corresponds 
to a sub band of wavelet packet and their corresponding 
relation is as follows: 
delta?1~4HZ ([6 1] [6 3] [6 2] ); 
theta?4~8HZ ([6 7] [6 6] [6 4] [6 5] );

According to the study of human brain signal, we choose 
4 leads that are most relevant to fatigue state, which are O1, 
O2, P7, and P8. Then, we can get 4 kinds of spontaneous 
rhythmic waves of EEG signals by reconstructing signals 
from wavelet packet node which are correspond to certain 
frequency band. We take average of EEG signals from the 4 
leads, calculate the 4 kinds of rhythm, and represent part of 
the rhythm as Fig. 5 and Fig. 6.

Fig. 7.  The indexes of fatigue state F in a 10-minute simulation driving 
when the subject was clear-minded and fatigue. This paper chose 1500 
sampling points as an elementary unit to calculate rhythmic waves. Some of 
the sampling points are deleted during EEG signal preprocessing part. 
As we can see from Fig. 7, the value of F fluctuate with 
sampling point, but F in clear-minded state is larger than F 
in fatigue state overall. 
According to Table 3, we delete the inconsistent time 
points. Using wavelet packet analysis method, we can get 
value F of the time point remaining. Specific situation is 
described as Fig. 8 and Fig. 9. 
From Fig. 8, Fig. 9, and Table 3, we can find F change 
with fatigue state. There is a trend that F decreases with the 
increase of fatigue state. As it’s generally considered that 
slow wave gradually increase and fast wave gradually 
reduce when drivers’ mental state change from clear-minded 
to fatigue, F will decrease with fatigue degree deepens. 
Therefore, the value of F can detect driving fatigue.

Fig. 9.  The value of F at each time point (Last 12 time points). 
Using feature extraction method, we get the fatigue 
feature. With video monitoring and subjective assessment, 
we get driver’s mental state at that time. So we can build 
driving fatigue detection model by sorting technique. In 
practice application, with EEG signals as input, we can get 
driver’s fatigue state, so as to aid driving. 
In order to test the validity of the fatigue feature, this 
paper divided fatigue state into two categories, which is 
clear-minded state and fatigue state, and classifies the EEG 
data with SVM algorithm. The average classification 
accuracy is up to 88.6207%, and the classification results 
show the driving fatigue detection model is accurate. 
VI. CONCLUSION 
In this paper, we analyzed the driving fatigue detection 
system based on EEG recognition in detail, and feature 
4041
  
extraction method of EEG signals is our focus. We built the 
driving fatigue detection system and verified our model by 
the driving simulation experimental data. The main research 
results in this paper are as follows: 
1) Fatigue feature F will decrease with fatigue degree 
deepens on condition that the experiment and the processing 
of EEG data are precise. 
2) A driving simulation system was set up to avoid boring 
and inaccuracy when sit for measuring EEG signals which 
makes the subject more focused. 
3) This paper combined the subjective evaluation section 
with video monitoring to judge driver’s status, which makes 
driving fatigue detection more accurate. 
4) With the fatigue features this paper proposed, driving 
fatigue detection in real-time is possible. In practice 
applications, we have to know one’s fatigue value range in 
advance so as to understand what the fatigue degree of the

Brain-Computer Interface technology is complex and 
involves many research fields, and there is still a long way to 
go in a wide range of practical application. The driver's data 
did not reach a certain size and only representative indexes 
chosen in this paper were analyzed. The driving fatigue 
detection model was not accurate and there were some 
limitations in the model. Therefore, some following aspects 
are needed for the further research: 
1) We should integrate a variety of driving operational 
information to build a more reliable and fatigue driving 
model; 
2) We should do researches on fatigue characteristics of 
EEG signal and improve the reliability of fatigue detection 
technology; 
3) We should compile the corresponding simulated 
driving system and the brain electrical signal processing PC 
interface, so as to realize the real-time detection of driver’s 
fatigue states. 
Obtaining reliable data on fatigue-related crashes is 
challenging. Fatigue, however, can be managed, and 
effectively managing fatigue will result in a significant 
reduction in related risk and improve safety. Driving fatigue 
detection system will benefit the realization of non-contact 
fatigue warning technology and it has great guiding 
significances in improving driving safety.
