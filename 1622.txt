Abstract— In order to share information in the cloud for
multi-robot systems, efﬁcient data transmission is essential
for real-time operations such as coordinated robotic missions.
As a limited resource, bandwidth is ubiquitously required by
applications among physical multi-robot systems. In this paper,
we proposed a hierarchical auction-based mechanism, namely
LQM (Link Quality Matrix)-auction. It consists of multiple
procedures, such as hierarchical auction, proxy scheduling. Note
that the proposed method is designed for real-time resource
retrieval for physical multi-robot systems, instead of simulated
virtual agents.
We validate the proposed mechanism through real-time
experiments. The results show that LQM-auction is suitable for
scheduling a group of robots, leading to optimized performance
for resource retrieval.
I. INTRODUCTION
Nowadays, mobile robotics evolves rapidly along with the
social development. They provide heterogeneous services
for humans. Not surprisingly, robotic services are more
complicated than ever before. Despite the diversity of robotic
services, it is impossible to develop a universal robot which
is capable of all expected services due to various limitations,
such as power consumption, payload, sensory and kinematic
constraints. As for a typical robotic system, a mobile robot
equipped with various sensors, is usually expensive and
power consuming. Beneﬁting from the highly developed
network, all primary information can be stored and retrieved
from online data centers such as a cloud, by which the
requirements on local infrastructures are alleviated.
Nevertheless, there are still drawbacks and challenges to
be further addressed. For instance, limited network band-
width and communication range in robotic system are the
primary hold-backs, since most of the robotic applications
need real-time data transmission, e.g. navigation and lo-
calization generally require a large bandwidth to transmit
the raw sensor measurements. Moreover, some applications
involving cooperative control of a robot team have hard
real-time communication requirements. Recently, the real-
time wireless multi-hop protocol (RT-WMP) [1] has been
proposed on top of IEEE 802.11, which provides real-time
communication among multiple robots. RT-WMP is capable
of managing the message priority and mobility for both
outdoor and indoor environments. Adopting this facility, we

propose an auction-based resource retrieval strategy. In this
paper for real-time data transmission among mobile robots.
Auction, a market-based approach, is one of the most
effective solutions for resource allocation and assignment
problems. As a primary strength of these approach, they only
rely on local information and self-interest of agents to arrive
efﬁcient solutions for large-scale, complex problems. The
ﬂexibility of the auction model allows agents to necessarily
cooperate and compete to accomplish resource allocation
efﬁciency. Therefore, auction-based mechanisms are widely
applied in multi-agent systems. Especially, multi-robot task
allocation [2] utilizes auction-based strategy, where tasks
are treated as commodities and auctioned to agents. The
agents can bid for a particular task regarding their own
requirement. Several related works have been reported in
this direction, e.g. loosely coupled tasks like exploration [3],
[4] and surveillance [5], and tightly coupled tasks like box
pushing [6] and robot soccer [7].
Auction mechanisms proposed for multi-robot task alloca-
tion mainly focus on coordinating robots for the completion
of a single complex task [8] or a bundle of tasks [9],
Moreover, bidding strategies [10] are proposed for different
objective optimization [11]. However, most aforementioned
mechanisms are validated among a large number of virtual
agents or only via simulated scenarios. Only few of them
have been evaluated on physical systems. For instance,
the MURDOCH [6] and TraderBot [12] have implemented
experiments in real-life. They focused on the coordination
among robot teams with an assumption that there was no
communication competition, which indicated that each robot
can perform an allocated task by itself. Unlike their work,
we aim at solving the resource competition among robots for
providing services in the cloud robotic system.
Furthermore, for distributed systems, hierarchical struc-
tures have been extensively studied in the domains of arti-
ﬁcial intelligence [13] and robotics [14]. The reason is that
the hierarchical methods usually decrease the undetermined
complexity for some NP-hard problems, such as Traveling
Salesman Problem (TSP) [15], ST-SR-TA problem [2] which
involves determining a schedule of tasks for each robot, as
an instance of a machine scheduling problem.
Considering the efﬁciency and fairness, we propose a
hierarchical auction mechanism based on link quality for
real-time resource retrieval in the cloud robotic system.
Speciﬁcally, this paper addresses the following aspects:
 A general hierarchical framework for real-time com-
munication is proposed, regarding efﬁcient resource
retrieval. It is validated by a typical network topology.

 A resource retrieval mechanism called LQM-auction is
proposed for local optimization of bandwidth allocation.
 A co-localization scenario is adopted for the evaluation
of the proposed mechanism in a typical real-time cloud
robotic system.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.
In the next section, we introduce the problem formulation
for resource retrieval for a real-time cloud robotic system.
In Section III, we propose the hierarchical LQM-auction
mechanism and corresponding theoretical proof. After that,
as a use-case, a co-localization experiment using multiple
mobile robots is introduced in Section IV, followed by the
analysis and discussion. At the end, we summarize this work.
II. PROBLEM FORMULATION
In the target system, each client retrieves data objects from
a central repository where the data are maintained by all other
clients. However, due to the distributed connection among
robots is a multi-hop network, an unmanaged resource re-
trieval system can easily overload the limited communication
capability [16]. In this section, we introduce a general
framework for real-time communication environment.

A. Network Topology
We use the aforementioned protocol RT-WMP [1] as the
routing protocol, which is on top of the IEEE 802.11, and
can manage the message priority in a cloud robotic system.
As an example shown in Fig. 1, a connected dynamic
network graphG(V;E;t) consists of a set of n nodes V =
fv
1
;v

;:::;v
n
g, where each node has a hop number h
i
,
and edges, which indicate the link quality among nodes by
E =flqm

is a hierarchy at timet, which is determined by the inherent
multi-hop mechanism.
Deﬁnition 2.1 (Layers): In a dynamic network graphG, all
the nodes in set V
l
that have the same hops h
l
to the proxy
lie in the same layer l, where V
l
:=fv

=l;l2 (1;L)g.
Deﬁnition 2.2 (Link Quality Matrix): The link qual-
ity matrix (LQM) of the graph is denote by a E :=
[lqm

;v

2V ]. The entrylqm

is the received signal
strength between pairs of nodes. All the nodes update their
LQM whenever a new frame is received. Eachlqm

by the following function:

where k is a system coefﬁcient related to the wavelength of

is the distance between v

and

, and  is an attenuation factor of the wireless channel.

B. Problem Objective
In the above mentioned robotic multi-hop network, ef-
ﬁcient frame transmission and power utilization should be
achieved in order to optimize the resource retrieval. Due to
the lack of global information in our network topology, we
deﬁne the objective as maximized the sum transmission rate
at each relay node in the following form:

where n
r
is the number of children of relay node v

, c

is
the cost of child v

.
The achieve rate of data from node v

to the relay node
v

is deﬁned as

in each channel. When a frame is transmitted
from node v

obtained at relay v

is

where d is a physical distance that hops to the relay node.
Note that the local optimization of the transmission rate at
each relay node, may not necessarily guarantee the fairness.
For instance, some of them may be transmitting at a very
low rate, while others may occupy most of the bandwidth.
Therefore, in the next section, we propose an auction mecha-
nism, which ensures that rate for any node cannot be further
increased without decreasing the rate for others.
III. HIERARCHICAL AUCTION MECHANISM
A. Deﬁnitions and Assumptions
Related terminologies and the algorithm introduced in this
section are illustrated in Fig. 2. At ﬁrst, several roles of
topological nodes in a multi-hop network are deﬁned as
follows.
 Proxy: A proxy distributes the resources in the cloud
according to the ﬁnal results of auctions.
 Client: The node that being part of the system, who
potentially has the needs for resource.
 Relay node: The clients that maintain the connectivity
of the network.

network that conducts the proposed auction mechanism. Brown eclipses
represent clients. The green star represents the access proxy to the data
center, who manages the data retrieval for this local network. The shaded
regions, which are the communication reachable for nodes in it, indicate the
competition (auction) among clients.
 Parent/Child: The clients that rely on a certain relay
node to get connectivity to the rest of the network are
the children of a relay node. Conversely, the relay node
is the parent of its children.
Considering the multi-hop network characteristics, we
emphasize the following assumptions for the hierarchical
auction mechanism:
 The relay nodes maintain connectivity by passing the
data frame of its children. Therefore, the relay selects
the client who bids the highest in each auction round.
 All children compete for the transmission opportunity
through relay node, and they don’t bid with children of
other relay nodes, even for those in the same layer.
 The connectivity cost is related to request bandwidth
for transmission of each node. The less of bandwidth
query, the lower cost it pays.
B. LQM-auction Strategy
The auction rules are described as:
 Known Information: The LQM of a network graph
G(V;E;t), and a set of price  ( > 0) of a unit
bandwidth announced by each relay node to its children
before the bidding start.
 Bids: b

is the bid of v

submits to the relay node v
r

we utilize the link quality as the bid whereb

 Allocation: The proxy allocates bandwidth in terms of
Bw
i
=
b

P
j2V
b

Bw (5)
where Bw is the total bandwidth of the link and Bw
i
is the bandwidth allocated to node i for transmission.
 Reward: node v

’s reward function equals to the
achieved rate 
ir
as (3).
 Cost: nodev

and the formula is as

Given the vector of bids b = (b

With the 

C. Implementation of LQM-auction Algorithm
The auction mechanism can provide an optimal response
ranking, which is the response order of requests from clients.
This response ranking is scheduled by proxy based on the
result of the ﬁnal auction. Given the above notations, let
b
i
(t) further denote the bid of clienti at timet. The auction
process is triggered by the request for resource. Then an
LQM-auction is executed for a local neighborhood (including
the clients and relay) as shown in Fig. 2. After each local
auction, the parent relay node represents the winning child
for next round auction. The detailed process is explained as
follows, and depicted in Fig. 3.

Fig. 3. Flowchart of the auction-based resource retrieval
 Initialization: Each relay node announces its particular
price
r
. Each client sets its own reward value regarding
2166
the price, and bid with its link quality which demon-
strates its connectivity status in the network. At the same
time, according to the network topologyG(V;E;t), the
relay nodes and layerl for each client are assigned. The
layer with maximum hop number is L.
 Hierarchical Auction: The auction process starts from
the relay nodes lie on layer L  1, denoted as a set
A := fa
i
g. For each a
i
, a Local Auction process is
the launched among the nodes in a set B :=fa

jchildren of(a

)g. After auctions are made in this
layer, the winning node is represented by its relay node
to a higher layer. Suppose a
i
is the relay node, then it
uses the link quality to its parent as the bid for next the
auction, while keep tracking the real winner in set B.
 Proxy Scheduling: The ﬁnal result of the auction is
assessed by the proxy. The winners (in the case that
multiple clients have the same winning bids) are stored
in the buffer. The proxy publishes a priority rank of
winners in this round. Then it sends back the queried
resource via network topology.
 Renewal Auction: Another round of the auction may be
deployed after each successful allocation. The bid list
is required to initialize for the next round of auction
according to their LQM. The process will end if all
requests from clients are fulﬁlled.
IV. EXPERIMENTAL VALIDATION
In this section, we validate the proposed LQM-auction in
a real experiment, which is introduced in detail in [17].
A. Experiment Design
In a dynamic environment, the map is usually not known
as a prior. In our test, there are two kinds of robots: the
ﬁrst one is the well-equipped leading robot, which combines
various kinds of sensors: a laser scanner mounted on rotation
unit for 3D scans, Ladybug camera and an inertial unit
(IMU) with a GPS module. Sufﬁcient information can be
retrieved for mapping and localization problems; the second
type is the so-called poor-equipped robot. It is a mobile robot
that equipped only with a camera and wireless connector.
The raw database is built before other clients can query the
information they need. We deﬁne a co-localization scenario
is shown as follows, with further depiction in Fig. 4.
 Relation database containing sensor and other percep-
tion data that is constructed before the operation of
poor-equipped robots. All the data can be queried by
any client to uncover the details of the environment.
 The data ﬂow in the proposed system framework has
been established in [17], and asynchronous access by
python-twisted library [18] is utilized. The only
update is a multi-hop token network conﬁguration [19]
that used in throughout this study. Each poor-equipped
robot sends requests of image to the proxy. Upon the
request, the proxy accesses the database and fetches the
target data.
 The related requests are to be negotiated with the prede-
ﬁned hierarchical auction mechanism before handling.
 Time of Response (ToR), Reliability of Response
(RoR), and usage of CPU and bandwidth are logged
on every robot to evaluate the experiment results. The
deﬁnition of ToR and RoR are as follows:
Deﬁnition 4.1 (Time of Response (ToR)): the period from
a request sending to its response receiving on a client.
ToR =T
Datareceived
 T

(11)
Deﬁnition 4.2 (Reliability of Response (RoR)): the con-
ﬁdence that the retrieval data are accurate received.
RoR =
#
SucceededRequests
#
TotalRequests
(12)
As the instance shown in Fig. 4, we put several Augmented
Reality (AR) markers in a typical indoor environment, poses
of which can be estimated using ARToolkit [20]. The well-
equipped robot builds a full 3D map with marker locations
registered on it as shown by active client 1 of Fig.4. All
information on the map is stored in the data center and
subscribed by poor-equipped robots that are winners of
previously introduced auction-based autonomous scheduling.
In the aspect of poor-equipped robots, each uses its camera
to take pictures of AR markers as depicted by active client
5, 8 and 9 in Fig. 4.
Fig. 4. A map of typical indoor environment for multi-robot co-localization
(10 active robots are in a multi-hop network which has a topology as shown
in Fig. 1.)
B. Experiment Analysis and Discussion
In the co-localization scenario of Fig. 4, we performed 100
trials for 10 active clients who attempt to localize themselves
by sending image queries to the proxy. Assuming that these
client robots have a graph connectivity of Fig. 1, when all
the robots transmit their requests in parallel, it is a dense
task for the limited network bandwidth. Since the relevant
work on physical robots is scarce, we implemented two
classical auction algorithms for validation and benchmark,
which are parallel auction (P-auction) [21] and naive auction
(N-auction) [22]. The following experiments are carried out
accordingly.

10 3 8 6.33 3 17 6.71 33 36 34.47
We ﬁrst compare the response ranking of each client
with different auction algorithms as shown in table I, where
“Hi.” is Highest Rank, “Lo.” is Lowest Rank, and “Avg.”
is Average Rank. It shows the highest, lowest and average
priority of ten clients for each column respectively. For
each row, it also shows the effects of three different auction
mechanisms on each client. For example, the worst average
priority for any node is 11.27 with LQM-auction, while it’s
21.74 (about 2 times as bad) for P-auction, and 34.53 (about
3 times as bad). The reason of the remarkable differences
is: The N-auction leads to the lowest ranks because it starts
with any assignment and any set of prices. If any assignment
is not the optimal one, it exchanges the assignment with the
assigned node at the beginning of the iteration. The process
repeats until all nodes are optimal. Compare with P-auction,
LQM-auction achieves higher ranks since the bidders in an
auction are selected based on P-auction.
Second, we compare the CPU load and bandwidth usage in
cases of without and with the different auction mechanisms.
As shown in Fig. 5, the average of network bandwidth has a
ﬂat usage when 10 clients are bidding for location retrievals.
It experiences several peaks of bandwidth usage when they
arbitrarily send requests without management. If they request
resources at the same time, it would result in massive packet
dropping, network congestion and unstable responses. There
is no big difference among cases of utilizing the three
auctions, since the quantity of total data transmission is the
same. In Fig. 6, the proxy avoided system halt by beneﬁting
from auction among clients. As depicted by the straight curve
in red, the proxy gets fully loaded on CPU capability which
would dramatically slow down the operations on it. Three
auction mechanisms have quite similar CPU load since they
have identical computational complexity.
Third, we compare the ToR including auction periods
with different auction mechanism. As shown in Fig. 7, four
blocks depict arbitrary query and three auction approaches. It
illustrates that the response time is much longer when many
clients arbitrarily query resources than they use the proposed
LQM-auction. Among the three auctions, the LQM-auction
has a least ToR than the others. It reveals the similar tendency

as table I, i.e. N-auction needs more iterations than others
because of the aforementioned ﬂaw.
Last but not least, we calculate the RoR as shown in
Fig. 8 when the bandwidth limitation is 2Mb/s for each
client in the distributed network. For each test, we setup a
timeout  as tolerance for resource retrieval missions. For
instance, if send the package size q will be 93:6MByte
in total, the transmission time is ideally q=(2Mb=s) =
46:875s. We observe that when is small, the RoR is greatly
affected. However, with the LQM-auction mechanism, clients
negotiate with their neighbours through an auction which
is organized by a relay client. The results demonstrate that
the average RoR has increased from 52%, 1% and 0.3% to
100%, 50% and 35% respectively. (In boxplot of Fig. 8, the
two signs of “+” are 1% and 0.3% for LQM-auction for
timeouts 10s and 20s) Therefore, LQM-auction is validated
to increase the efﬁciency of resource retrieval greatly.

V. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we proposed a hierarchical auction-based
mechanism called LQM-auction for autonomous negotiation
among robots in a cloud robotic system. We aimed at
solving fair and efﬁcient resource retrieval for real-time
data transmission among robots in a distributed multi-hop
network. We speciﬁed the proposed mechanism with auc-
tion taxonomy, and theoretically veriﬁed that LQM-auction
can achieve the best response. Furthermore, we validated
the proposed LQM-auction using a real-time co-localization
scenario. The conducted results, including comparisons in
the CPU/bandwidth usage, the time of responses and the
reliability of responses conﬁrmed the good performance of
LQM-auction.
