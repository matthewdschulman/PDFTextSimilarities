Statistical Identiﬁcation and Macroscopic Transitional Model between
Disorder and Order
Helge A Wurdemann, Vahid Aminzadeh and Jian S Dai
Abstract— Food processing provides a lot of possibilities to
apply robotics and automation. In this paper, we identify
disordered and ordered states of discrete food products. The
concept of Degree of Disarray is introduced. Food ordering
processes such as vibratory feeders, multi-head weighers, pick
and place operations are common automation in food industry
to transfer products from a higher to a lower Degree of
Disarray. Parts entropy is introduced to describe a product’s
individual state based on the symmetry categorisation. A
macroscopic transitional model is presented which determines a
subspace of the disordered arrangement using the eigenvectors
of the largest eigenvalues of the covariance matrix. A projection
into this created subspace follows. As soon as the disorder
state in only one dimension is achieved, the point of disorder
can be derived which ﬁnally transfers the objects into order.
From here, a transformation to any order arrangement in any
dimension is possible. This methodology is applied to pick and
place operations and experiments are conducted.
I. INTRODUCTION
At many places in a food production process, previously
well ordered products lose orientation and/or positional
arrangement and need to be physically re-ordered for the
next process. The Food Standards Agency
1
of the United
Kingdom says that the food industry accounts for 15% of
the UK’s total manufacturing sector by value, it is the largest
sector of the industry. Within all areas of the food industry,
automation has been applied in various ways to either support
workers in their area of operation or function at a case-by-
case basis [1]–[3]. The motivations and drive forces for such
automation are efﬁciency, consistency of quality, increased
hygiene and reduced labour costs [4].
Whereas the motor industry has a robot for every 10 em-
ployees, the food industry has a robot installation per 1100
people [5]. British Automation and Robot Association [6]
pointed out that robotics have started to make inroads in
the food industry [7]. It is expected that this sector will be
the next big expansion area [8]. Though most robots in the
food industry today are used for handling products packed
in primary or secondary packing and palletizing, handling
operations are of special interest where a large number of
low-skilled personnel are used to transfer unpacked products
or feed machines with little added value to the product [9].
In the food industry, there is a large number of food ordering

processes such as the vibratory feeder, multi-head weigher,
size grader, guidance and buffering conveyor belts, pick-and-
place operations [10] and bin picking [11], [12].
In this paper, the research objective is to understand the
principle of transferring randomly distributed food products
into structure using the Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
which was initially introduced by Hotelling [13]. However,
a mathematical ansatz [14] can be found earlier by Pear-
son [15], Cauchy [16] or Jordan [17]. PCA is formalised
as a multivariant statistical technique that analyses a list of
data arrays and describes these new as a set of orthogonal
principal components. In general, the derived variables are
inter-correlated. On the one hand, a PCA is applied in order
to ﬁnd the direction of variation, on the other hand, its appli-
cation aims for data reduction [18]. The last idea is of interest
within this paper. Fodor [19] summarised the dimensional
reduction techniques and refers to the PCA as the best linear
reduction analysis in the mean-square sense [20]. In depth
information about its properties, interpretation and analysis
can be found in [21].
This paper is organised as follows: The various disorder
states of food products are identiﬁed statistically in Sec-
tion II and III. Further, a macroscopic transitional model
is presented how to theoretically transfer disordered food
products into order (Section IV). Thus, the covariance matrix
is analysed and subspaces are created. Locating the centre of
disorder, it is possible to re-arrange any ordered formation.
On the other hand, decreasing the disorder means that the
parts entropy descreases as well. The presented food re-
arrangement is then introduced to a pick and place operation
in Section V and evaluated.
II. DESCRIPTION OF DISORDERED FOOD PRODUCTS
Mechanisms have a certain Degree of Freedom (DoF)
that is the set of independent displacements (x, y, z) and
rotations (, , ) that specify the displaced or deformed
position and orientation of the body or system [22]–[24].
In space, the maximum DoF of an object is six. Food
products that are distributed in a three dimensional space
(<
3
) or on a planar surface (<
2
) have a certain DoF, too. In
order to know the status of disorder, the Degree of Disarray
(DoD) is introduced here. This is to describe the initial
possible disorder of a food product considering the symmetry
and shape and the mathematical space that the objects are
arranged in.
Table I summarises all possible DoD states. Two examples

1) In some cases, food products are transported from
one plant to another in bins (<
3
). Disordered products
then need to be relocated and reoriented (6 DoD) for
further processing. Depending on the symmetry of the
products (see Table II), the rotation can be neglected.
Hence, only a translation is necessary to put them into
a structured arrangement (3 DoD).
2) Within food companies, products usually move along
a conveyor belt, on a planar, two dimensional surface.
The DoD should be three (two translational and one
rotational DoF about the z-axis). However, another
rotational DoD has to be added since food products
on a conveyor belt can be upside down, for instance
(see space <
2:5
).
III. INTRINSIC RELATION BETWEEN SYMMETRY AND
PARTS ENTROPY
As mentioned before, a food product F hast DoD, where

statistically independent and can be written as:

This describes the uncertainty of position and orientation of
a single food product. The next step is to introduce entropy
in order to understand the connection to disorder and apply
this statistical approach.
In this paper, the entropy is interpreted as a measurement
of a mean information content or information density, as
it was deﬁned by Shannon primarily [27]. The information

will be the minimal amount of bits that are necessary for
a transmission or demonstration of an information. This is

This is greater, the more improbable a symbol will be. The
information content does not have a huge impact technically
but the mean information. This is the point entropy becomes
relevant because the mean information content or the entropy
is deﬁned as:

deﬁnes this as the parts entropy.
Instead of describing the shape of the product [26], the
number of planes of symmetry and their relationship is
considered here (Table II). Following this approach also
provides information about the location of the Centre of
Gravity (CoG) of a product which is useful for further
processes including gripping, for instance. If a product is of
uniform density, the intersection of these planes of symmetry
locates the CoG. On the other hand, the intersection of two
or more planes of symmetry forms a line. In this case, the
CoG is described by the symmetry line. Using a resolution
of v bits for each transitional and rotational parameter, the
parts entropy for a food product is determined in Table III.

IV. MACROSCOPIC TRANSITION BETWEEN DISORDER
AND ORDER
Whereas parts entropy gives individual information about
discrete food products, this section derives a macroscopic
transfer function for the transition between disorder and order
(see Fig. 1). The idea is to reduce the dimension of disorder
stepwise until a disordered arrangement is achieved in only
one dimension. This means that the maximum DoD in<
3
is
reduced to two translational and one rotational DoD as shown
in Table I. In<
1
, the transitional DoD is along a line. Once
this stage is achieved, it is possible to determine the point
of disorder and transfer disorder into order. From 1D
Order
,
ordered arrangements in any dimension is achievable.

C. Determination of the Line of Disorder
Having reduced the initial point cloud into an Euclidean

can be determined for the two dimen-
sional point cloud F

. Its eigenvalues are

E. Reducing the Parts Entropy
Whereas the macroscopic transitional model describes the
global re-arrangement of the food products, this has an
impact on the individual DoD as well. As mentioned before,
Table III links the symmetry category to the parts entropy.
The lower the dimension of the space considered, the lower
is the parts entropy. Thus, by transferring objects that are
distributed in a three dimensional space to spaces of lower
dimensions, the parts entropy and therefore the DoD will
decrease. In the status of 1D
Disorder
, the orientational parts
entropy is zero. Here is the link to 1D
Order
and other possible
structured arrangements.
V. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS FOR PICK AND PLACE
OPERATIONS
Delta robots have been designed for high-speed pick and
place tasks that are capable of around 150 picks per minute.
This type of robot has typically a 1-2 kg payload. The pick

Fig. 4. Planar biscuits randomly distributed on a conveyor belt
and place system is typically fed by conveyor belts. A vision
system will determine the position and orientation of the food
product. The robot picks the product up from the conveyor,
brings the product into the desired orientation, and places it
on the target location.
This product transfer operation for ordering food products
is used as an example for the developed transitional model.
In this case, the operation concentrates on ordering products
from 2D
Disorder
to 1D
Disorder
.
A. Typical Input-Output Arrangements
As mentioned, the input of pick and place operations is
usually on planar surfaces. While products are transported
on conveyor belts, they are handled at the same time. The
order sometimes gets lost during further processing and
products have to be re-arranged on the same conveyor belts.
Figure 4 shows a typical arrangement where planar biscuits
(one symmetry axis, 8 planes) are randomly distributed.
In this case the conveyor belt moves in y-direction with a
constant velocity. The ﬂow and density of the food products
is almost uniform.
Figure 5 shows different containers for cookies. Before
biscuits get packaged, these layouts or similar arrangements
are preferred in food industry. The biscuits for the container
in Figure 5(b) for instance need to be ordered in a row of
four equally spaced cookies. Here, each row has multiple
layers. This is a common output structure of a food ordering
process.

B. Line and Centre of Disorder for Groups of Products
On the one hand, each biscuit can be transferred to a new
area into an ordered arrangement. By doing so, each product
is picked up, directly transferred into the structured arrange-
ment and into the container respectively. This assignment is
optimised by the transition model presented in this paper.
The arrangement into order is taken place on the same area
of the conveyor belt. Therefore, the constant ﬂow of biscuits
is divided into groups of a certain amount of products. This
is dependant on the output structure.
In Figure 6, a group of ﬁve cookies is given as an example.
A line of disorder S
1D
is determined according to the
statistical analysis in Section IV-C. Thus, each of the ﬁve
food products have a minimal Euclidean distance to this
subspace. Considering an equally spaced distance between
the biscuits, these are transferred onto the line of disorder
for the ﬁnal output arrangement.
Figure 6(b) shows an alternative array. The products are
stacked layer by layer having determined the centre of
disorder. Having ﬁnished this food ordering process, the
bunch of products will be picked and placed into the suitable
container.
C. Experimental Simulation and Evaluation
We have simulated a pick and place operation whereN
5 products scattered on a planar surface are ordered along
a line using the proposed PCA approach. The eigenvector
of the largest eigenvalue of the covariance matrix gives
the minimal distance between the food products and the
vector according to Equation 14. The products are projected
and equally positioned along this line. Then, the group is
picked and placed in the ﬁnal position. Figure 7 shows the
simulation results. The simulation is repeated 100 times and
the total cost of handling recorded. The mean cost of the
global transitional model is 37:61.
VI. CONCLUSIONS
This paper investigated a macroscopic transitional model
from disorder to order. Here, we speciﬁcally looked at order-
ing processes in food industry. The different disorder states
have been identiﬁed. On a microscopic level, the disorder
of individual food products is determined introducing parts
entropy. It shows that the Degree of Disarray and the parts
entropy of an individual discrete food product decrease as the
dimensional space is reduced. Thus, the global mathematical

model presented is to reduce the Euclidean space and project
the position of the objects into this subspace: The location
of food products are assumed as a point cloud. This random
distribution is then analysed in a statistical way using the
eigenvectors of the covariance matrix. A linear combination
of a lower dimensional subspace is formed and the point
cloud projected into this subspace. This procedure is fol-
lowed until the centre of disorder is found. Using a linear
transformation matrix, the food products can be transferred
into any structured arrangement.
In food industry, there are practical ordering operations that
show where this implemented approach has advantages over
commonly used operational processes. In pick and place
operations for instance, the transitional model presented
allows structuring randomly distributed food products on a
plane surface handling a group of products. This ordering
operation is processed with respect of the disordered loca-
tion. Instead of picking each object and placing it in the
container, this macroscopic model re-arranges the foodstuffs
and then transfers the grouped, ordered food products into a
suitable container or onto another conveyor belt for further
processing. In future work, we will compare the proposed
technique to other optimisation algorithms such as the Hun-
garian algorithm or Travelling Salesman Problem.
