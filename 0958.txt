AbstractÑ In this endeavor, a hybrid control strategy has 
been proposed for composite path tracking control of a 
nonholonomic wheeled mobile robotic (WMR) system under 
parametric and nonparametric uncertainties. A WMR, often in 
practical circumstances, undergoes through various parametric 
changes. Moreover, modeling of WMR in presence of friction, 
slip or skid, backlash etc. is very difficult. These factors, which 
make the system model more cumbersome, are normally 
ignored but their effects are compensated through appropriate 
control methods. Conventional Sliding Mode Control (SMC) is 
such a method but it is susceptible to chattering due to high 
switching gains and reasonable tracking accuracy is sacrificed 
to avoid chattering. On the other hand, Time Delay Control 
(TDC) technique is highly efficient to assure robustness against 
unknown dynamics but it is unable to eliminate approximation 
errors that arise due to introduced delay. Considering the 
aforesaid difficulties of SM and TD controllers a hybrid control 
methodology christened as Time Delay Sliding Mode Control 
(SMC-TD) is adopted in this work for accurate path tracking of 
nonholonomic WMR. The SMC-TD is absolutely a judicious 
blending of SMC and TDC strategies aiming at elimination of 
the individual shortcomings while retaining the positive 
advantages. Detail features and advantages of the proposed 
controller are presented in greater length along with the 
experimental results, which are very promising. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
 Nonholonomic systems are defined, in general, as 
systems that satisfy certain non-integrable constraints. Such 
constraints may arise as a result of physical kinematic 
constraints imposed on the system which are expressed in 
terms of the generalized velocities of the system and cannot 
be integrated over time, and thus cannot be expressed in 
terms of the generalized coordinates only. Nonholonomic 
mobile robots have received a lot of attention in the past two 
decades because of their ability to work through large 
application domains, such as: (i) transportation, (ii) planetary 
exploration, (iii) surveillance, (iv) security, (v) military 
targets tracking, and (vi) human-machine-interfaces for 
people with mobility deficiency. Design of suitable 
controllers for Path tracking of WMR with appropriate

trajectory commands are well addressed by the research 
communities and controllers are implemented mainly based 
on kinematic and dynamic model. Amongst the kinematic 
model based controllers, De wit and Khennouf  [1] designed 
a piecewise continuous closed loop controller based on the 
kinematic model of the robot and showed exponential 
stabilization around the origin. Guldner and Utkin [2] applied 
SMC using LyapunovÕs function. Jiang and Pomet [3] used 
back stepping technique for adaptive control of 
nonholonomic systems with unknown parameters. Hamel and 
Meizel [4] claimed robustness against localization errors in 
their proposed controller. Aguilar et al. [5] proposed a SMC 
based control approach for path-following of a car-like robot 
while ensuring robustness against localization and curvature 
errors. A SM based controller for posture stabilization and 
trajectory tracking of a WMR was reported by Chawa [6].  
Relevant assumptions during kinematic modeling are 
responsible for modeling errors, which create difficulties in 
efficient control of WMR. These circumstances necessitate 
consideration of the dynamic model of WMR (Kolmanovsky 
and McClamroch [7], Fierro and Lewis [8]). Gradually, many 
researchers followed the dynamic model based controller 
design approach. Yang and Kim [9] adopted SMC for simple 
trajectory tracking of WMR in polar coordinates for posture 
representation using computed-torque technique. Corradini 
and Orlando [10] used discrete time SMC for trajectory 
tracking control. Chen et al. [11] reported an adaptive SMC 
method where adaptive control is used to approximate the 
upper bounds of uncertainty.  To tackle higher bound of 
uncertainty SMC suffers from chattering effect due to 
increase in switching gains, which may also activate high 
frequency un-modeled dynamics causing harmful effect on 
robotic systems. Furthermore, nominal model of the system is 
required for bound estimation, which is tough to achieve for a 
complex WMR system. Oriolo et al. [12] compared the 
performance of dynamic feedback linearization against the 
simple linear feedback linearization as well as nonlinear 
feedback linearization for trajectory tracking and posture 
stabilization. Sun [13] used exact feedback linearization and 
pole placement approach to devise a trajectory tracking 
controller. Feedback linearization technique for path tracking 
of a WMR incorporating the actuator dynamics was reported 
by Nandy et al. [14]. Shojaei et al. [15] reported an inverse 
dynamics and robust-PID based trajectory tracking control 
strategy. Realization of feedback linearization control 
through inverse dynamics formulation requires exact 
knowledge of the hardware parameters. While performing 
various tasks different payload sensors are used which in turn 
affect the dynamic parameters like mass, moment of inertia 
(MOI), centre of mass (COM), wheel radius etc. Lizarralde et 
al. [16] applied Kalman Filter (KF) in association with the

model predictive control technique to estimate the states of   
WMR accurately. Wang and Wilson [17] used KF for 
estimating the orientation and position of WMR. A KF based 
active observer entailing robust path following control of 
WMR was addressed by Coelho and Nunes [18].  
 Presented here a time-delay sliding mode control (SMC-
TD) methodology for accurate path tracking of WMR, 
inspired from Morioka et al. [19]. This hybrid control 
methodology takes care the parametric uncertainties caused 
due to variation in hardware parameters and also evaluates 
the Lagrange multipliers including combined effect of the un-
modeled dynamic components such as friction slip, skid etc. 
through estimate of an appropriate function, using the TDC 
[20] method. This control algorithm also helps to negate the 
estimation error using the switching logic. The performance 
of the controller has been verified through extensive 
simulation and experimentation utilizing a WMR, named 
ÔDrishtiÕ designed and developed by the Robotics and 
Automation Laboratory of CSIR-CMERI, Durgapur, India. 
     The article is organized as follows: The dynamics of 
WMR is briefly described in section 2. Section 3 describes 
the proposed hybrid control methodology in detail. Section 4 
and section 5 presents the simulation study and experimental 
results while Section 6 concludes the entire work. 
II. DYNAMICS OF WMR  
 
Figure 1.   Schematic diagram of the wheeled mobile robot 
A WMR is considered as an appropriate example of a 
nonholonomic system. A two wheeled vehicle shown in Fig. 
1 is analyzed in detail by Nandy et al. [14]. The vehicle is 
driven by two motors connected to the two wheels of radius r 
which are separated by distance b. Length of the vehicle is 
considered as L. A body-fixed (moving) coordinate system is 
placed at the COM, which is assumed to be at an offset 
distance d along x-axes from the axle of the robot. Let, 
P
m be 
the mass of the mobile robot platform without the driving 
wheels, the motors rotor, and gearbox rotor,
w
m represents the 
mass of each driving wheel and the associated motor rotor 
including gearbox rotor, 
P
I be the MOI of the platform about 
a vertical axes passing through the COM of the platform, 
w
I
is the equivalent wheel MOI referred to wheel axis, ? is the 
offset between COM of the overall system and the platform 
and 
m
I represents MOI of each wheel and associated motor 
including gearbox rotor about a wheel diameter passing 
through the z-axis. The position of the WMR can be specified 
by three generalized coordinates ,,
cc
xy ? where, ( , )
cc
xy are 
the coordinates of the COM of the system. To specify 
coordinates of any point on the wheels two more variables 
and
rl
?? (i.e. rotation of the right and left wheels 
respectively,  so long as the axes of the wheels are fixed with 
respect to the cart) are needed. So, the generalized coordinate 
vector of the system contains five generalized coordinates 
( . . 5) i e n? and is expressed as

III. CONTROLLER DESIGN 
A.  Conventional Sliding Mode Control (SMC) Approach 
      SMC is a special category of Variable Structure Control, 
whose structures are switched judiciously according to 
certain switching logic to achieve desired system behavior. 
SMC provides robustness against any parametric 
uncertainties and other disturbances, which must lie in the 
image space of the input i.e. matched uncertainties [21] as 
well as within the capacity of the actuators in real situation. 
The design of SM controller is carried out in two steps: 
design of appropriate sliding surface (s = 0) and making the 
surface attractive by an appropriate control law so that the 
system trajectory points towards the sliding surface.  
        In general, if a system with n degrees of freedom 
(DOF) to be controlled and for each DOF if the order turns 
out to be N, the sliding surface for each state variable is 
selected constructing a function of the error and its 
derivatives as follows,

where, 
i
e Õs are the state errors and 0
i
?? represent  the i
th 
 
state gains pertaining to the state error convergence rate 
towards the equilibrium points. The finite reaching condition 
and assured decrement of distance along all system 
trajectories to the sliding surface is established by choosing 
the overall control law u such that outside of surface for 
each DOF the following condition is fulfilled:

where, 0
i
?? for 1,2, , in ? is satisfied. The term 
i
? is 
responsible for finite time reaching condition. By adapting 
the condition mentioned in (17), the time 
si
t to reach 0
i
s? 
satisfies the following criterion [22]: 
? ? 0 / .
si i i

If the sliding surface is reached at 
si
tt ?
 
and ideal sliding 
motion takes place, then the switching function satisfies 
0
i
s? for all 
si
tt ?
 
. This condition implies that 0
i
s? for all 
si
tt ? when system lies on the sliding surface. Higher choice 
of 
i
? for a given ? ? 0
i
s would ensure faster reaching phase 
with increase of switching gain which might induce the 
possibility of chattering simultaneously.

Next, the hybrid strategy for better performance is presented.
 
B. Sliding Mode Control with Time Delay (SMC-TD) 
      To make the SM controller to work in a broader range 
higher uncertainty bounds may be considered. This in turn 
requires higher switching gains, which leads to chattering. 
To avoid chattering we need to increase ? in lieu of tracking 
accuracy. In practical scenario backlash, friction, slip or skid 
etc. normally exist but not considered for modeling due to 
extensive modeling effort and complicated nature of the 
model, which necessitates the incorporation of TDC. The 
SMC-TD approach provides two major advantages; (i) 
reduction in switching gains through approximation of the 
un-modeled dynamics and other combined disturbances and 
(ii) elimination of approximation error that arises from time 
delay logic of TDC.

IV. SIMULATION RESULTS 
       Based on the above formulation circular and lawn mower 
reference paths are selected for simulation. Unlike SMC, 
SMC-TD does not require the knowledge of the Coriolis, 
centripetal, Lagrange multipliers and other un-modeled 
factors. Thus, (25) is used for the SMC-TD, whereas SM 
controller requires (14). The controller parameters are chosen 
as diag( ) {2,2,2,2,2}, 0.1s
d
t ?? ? for both the controllers. 
To verify the performance of the controllers the system is 
subjected to a sinusoid (absolute value) payload variation 
[23] as depicted in Fig. 2 taking WMR nominal mass 35 kg.

at Robotics and Automation group of CSIR-CMERI. The 
solid wheels with radius of 96 mm are stiff enough that point 
contact with the ground can be assumed and are mounted on 
an axle of 414 mm long. A small passive caster wheel with 
70 mm diameter is placed in the rear of the vehicle at a 
distance of 374 mm from the axle. The chassis of the robot 
contains a single board computer (SBC, PC-104+ 
architecture, Pentium M 1.8 GHz), two Maxon motors (90W 
each), transmission elements, electronics, and three set 24 V, 
22Ah high energy density Li-polymer batteries and the sensor 
suite. Each motor is equipped with an incremental encoder 
and a gearbox with reduction ratio 91. The communication 
between the server and client of Drishti is maintained through 
a ÔD-linkÕ USB modem. Experimentally, it is not exactly 
possible to imitate a sinusoidal payload variation like 
simulation study. Here, the robot carries a 6 kg Laser Range 
Finder as extra payload. To create a time varying payload and 
to achieve various COM and variations of inertia, further 3 
kg load was added/removed alternatively on/from the WMR 
platform at random places as shown in Fig. 10.

A. Circular Path 
The circular path tracked by the WMR, when two 
different controllers are employed, is demonstrated in Fig. 
11. The corresponding absolute 
c
x and 
c
y positional errors 
are plotted in Fig. 12 and Fig. 13 respectively. From the 
received sensor data it is observed that positional 
information at some instants remain same giving spikes in 
the error plots of SMC. This gives an indication of slippage. 
As slip is not considered while modeling, performance of 
SMC degrades. But due to its robustness property it still tries 
to overcome that and pushes the error downwards 
periodically. SMC-TD is capable of managing such un-
modeled dynamics using the time delay logic and gives the 
superior performance. Again, with the switching logic it 
eliminates the approximation error to a great extent. The 
performances of the two controllers are depicted in Table-I 
by means of the average error (Avg. err.) for long term 
performance and evaluating the maximum error (Max. err.) 
for momentary performance. The percentage errors are 
calculated with respect to diameter of circular path.

VI. CONCLUSION 
This paper proposed a time delay sliding mode based 
hybrid control strategy and validated through simulation and 
experimentation for efficient path tracking of WMR. The 
proposed hybrid controller (SMC-TD) judiciously fuses the 
best features of the SM and TDC, providing assured 
robustness to the system from two fronts, overcoming their 
individual shortcomings. The SMC-TD aims at the reduction 
of the switching gain of the SMC as well as ensures reduced 
modeling effort of the complex WMR through the embedded 
TD logic. On the other front, SMC deals with the 
approximation error generated from TDC applying the 
switching logic. The experiments show promising result in 
terms of the path tracking performance of the SMC-TD with 
WMR compared to the conventional SM controller.
