Abstract—This paper focuses on the elastodynamic analysis
of cable-driven parallel manipulators. Dynamic stiffness matrix
of a single sagging cable is introduced. This matrix considers
the effect of both cable mass and elasticity. Dynamic response
functions are evaluated for cable-driven parallel manipulators.
As an example, the dynamic analysis of a 6-DOF cable-
suspended parallel manipulator is achieved considering the
dynamicbehaviorofsagging cables. Numericalsimulations and
tests are demonstrated to validate the model by identifying
the natural frequencies. Effects of cable sag on the static pose
error are also experimentally investigated. Results show the
importance of taking into consideration the cable dynamics for
cable-driven parallel manipulators when it comes to perform

I. INTRODUCTION
Cable-driven parallel manipulators (CDPMs) are a special
variant of traditional rigid-link parallel manipulators. Using
ﬂexible cables rather than rigid links has lots of advantages,
such as higher dynamics due to smaller moving mass, much
larger workspace, and lower cost. However, as cables present
the particularity of not being rigid and are only able to
act in tension, the stiffness of CDPMs becomes a vital
concern [1], [2]. Effects of cable stiffness are signiﬁcant for
the kinematics analysis, workspace deﬁnition, pose accuracy,
force distribution, vibration and control of CDPMs [3], [4].
Although stiffness has been well studied in the last few
decades for rigid-link parallel manipulators [3]–[8], there is
little literature on the stiffness problem of CDPMs. Previous
studies mainly consider cables as ideal lines without mass
or elasticity [9]–[11].
When it comes to static stiffness analysis, many studies
usedlinearornon-linearspringasthecablemodel[12]–[20].
This approach considers the elasticity along cable axis and
neglects cable mass. Another well known model is the static
sagging cable model derived from civil engineering [21]. It
is used in several previous researches [1], [2], [22]–[24]. For
example: stiffness matrix of a single cable induced by sag is
derived, and a sample 3-DOF planar manipulator stiffness is
estimated in [22]; Relationship between cable sagging and
manipulator stiffness is analyzed through the mapping of
intuitive stiffness indices [24]. Generally speaking, sagging
cable model considering the effect of mass and elasticity is
more accurate than spring cable model in the static stiffness

equations, where cable force and cable length are coupled.
Experimental veriﬁcation of the static characteristics is only
performed on a single sagging cable [21], [22] and not on a
complete CDPM.
Some applications of CDPM require high performances,
especially the dynamic behaviors. For examples: the ultra-
high speed FALCON robot [14], [15], the wind-induced
vibration problem of the large radio telescope [25]. These
applications lead to study cable vibrations and the resulting
platform vibrations. Vibrations can be induced by initial
position and velocity of the moving platform, wind distur-
bance, and/or friction of the cables around ﬁxed pulleys
[26]. In these situations, dynamic stiffness of cables must
be taken into consideration. Manipulator vibrations due to
axial and transversal cable ﬂexibilities are studied in [27],
and natural frequencies are calculated in [27], [28]. Through
a linearization method, the natural frequencies of a 3-DOF
planar CDPM are calculated in [22]. Cable model used in
[27] and [28] is spring model with elasticity but without
mass. Cable mass and ﬂexibility are considered only for
the static stiffness computation in [22], but neglected for
the system natural frequency computation. As a matter of
fact, in many situations, cable mass and elasticity affect
system dynamics by changing natural frequencies values
and/or adding new resonances.
Inthispaper,anewdynamicstiffnessmodelisproposedto
analyze the vibrations of CDPMs. It is based on the dynamic
stiffness matrix of a continuous, ﬂexible, extensible, sagging
cable [29]. This matrix considers the effects of both cable
mass and elasticity. The dynamic stiffness matrix and dy-
namic response functions of CDPM are achieved considering
the coupling between platform motions and cable-end forces.
The effects of cable sag on the static pose error and on
the dynamic response functions of a 6-DOF cable-suspended
manipulator are numerically and experimentally investigated.
This paper is organized as follows. Dynamic stiffness ma-
trix of a single sagging cable is ﬁrstly introduced in Section
II. Then dynamic characteristics of CPDM are presented in
Section III, including dynamic stiffness matrix deduction
and dynamic response functions computation. Section IV
presents an example of a 6-DOF cable-suspended manip-
ulator, and discusses the effects of dynamic sagging cable
by numerical simulations and experiments. The effects of
cable sag on the static pose error are also experimentally
investigated. An explicit comparison with the results of
other methods available in literature is presented. Finally,
conclusions are made in Section V.

II. DYNAMIC STIFFNESS MATRIX OF SAGGING
CABLE
In this section, improved dynamic stiffness matrix of a
single cable is formulated by considering the cable mass,
elasticity and damping [29]. The model for an inclined cable
is presented in Fig. 1. One of the cable-ends is ﬁxed, and an
external force is applied to the other end of the cable. Under
the effect of external force and gravity, the shape of the cable
between points A and B is not a straight line, but a sagging
curve. The cable is considered as a continuum and its shape
is given by l (the chord length), d (the sag perpendicular to
the chord), and ? (the inclination angle). According to [29],
the following assumptions are made.
• The cable is assumed to be uniform with unstrained
cross section area A, mass per unit length m, and linear
Young’s modulus E.
• Only small displacements are admitted to meet the
requirement of linear theory.
• Out-of-plane cable motion is neglected.
• Only small cable sag is allowed, where the sag to span
ratio is no more than 1/20.
• Viscous damping is taken into consideration.

Derived in a local xyz-coordinate system where the z-
axis is vertical, the planar stiffness matrix K of a single
sagging cable can be deﬁned as the relationship between
the forces [f

and the displacements [?

z
] at the same position (1). The
displacement and force are both deﬁned as differentials that
represent small changes in position or force from static
equilibrium.

According to [29], the stiffness matrix K of a planar

As one can see, the contribution of the cable vibrations
must be considered because considerable variations of the
dynamic stiffness amplitude are present within the range of
4056
the natural frequencies, and these variations are associated
with symmetric and antisymmetric modes of the cable.
For sake of conciseness, only vibrations within the cable
plane are considered here. In linear theory the in-plane
motionisuncoupledfromtheout-of-planemotion.Extension
to spatial dynamic stiffness matrix is possible without major
difﬁculty [30].
III. DYNAMIC CHARACTERISTICS OF CDPMS
A. PROBLEM DESCRIPTION
According to the arrangement of the cables, two kinds
of CDPMs can be considered. One is cable-suspended par-
allel manipulator, where all the driven cables are above
the moving platform and gravity acts as a virtual cable
to keep equilibrium, such as the CoGiRo robot [31]. The
other is non-suspended or fully constrained cable parallel
manipulator, where at least one driven cable is below the
moving platform, such as the FALCON robot [15]. For non-
suspended cable parallel manipulators, manipulator stiffness
canbereinforcedandvibrationscanbereducedbyincreasing
cable forces from redundant actuation [15]. In addition,
knowledge of modal characteristics of the manipulator is
useful to attenuate the wind-induced vibrations (wind-tunnel
applications) or to improve the high-speed cable robot con-
trol. For cable-suspended parallel manipulator, manipulator
stiffness remains broadly lower. In this case, a major control
issue is to suppress the platform vibrations to ensure the po-
sitioning accuracy by decreasing the stabilization time, such
aspick-and-placeapplications.Soinherentdynamiccoupling
analysis between manipulator motions and dynamic cable
stiffnessisstronglyneededforthetwokindsofCDPMs.This
section focuses on cable-suspended parallel manipulator but
the method can be extended to non-suspended cable parallel
manipulators. In this section, the dynamic stiffness matrix
of cable-suspended parallel manipulator is established. The
dynamic response functions and the natural frequencies are
used to investigate its properties.

C. VIBRATION ANALYSIS
For CDPMs, the system stiffness is mainly affected by
the stiffness of their cables, actuators, and moving platform.
Compared with cables, the compliance of actuators and
moving platform are much lower and therefore neglected.
The free vibration equations of a CDPM can be written as:
M
¨
x(t)+K
e
(?)x(t)=0; (13)
where x represents the perturbation of the moving platform
in position and orientation from the static equilibrium. M is
the 6 by 6 mass matrix of the moving platform.
In the previous study [22], [27], [28], cable mass is
neglected on the vibration analysis. The system stiffness
matrix K
e
is constant. According to the free vibration theory
of multi-degree-of-freedom system, the natural frequencies
of the CDPM can be calculated by transforming system
dynamic equation into its modal space, and then solving the
classic eigenvalue and eigenvector problems.
However, in this paper, both cable mass and elasticity are
considered. As a result, the system stiffness matrix K
e
(?) is
function of frequency?. The above method for linear multi-
degree-of-freedom system is not suitable. The analysis of the
dynamic response function of the manipulator to a harmonic
excitation can be used.
For each pose of the moving platform path, the dynamic
equation of a CDPM under a harmonic excitation can be
written as:

STATIC AND DYNAMIC BEHAVIORS OF THE
MANIPULATOR
In this section, a 6-DOF cable-suspended parallel manip-
ulator driven by 6 cables is presented as an example to
investigate the effects of sagging cable on the static and
dynamic characteristics of CDPM.
A. STUDIED MODEL DESCRIPTION
As presented in Fig. 4, there are 6 attachment points
on the three vertical poles and 6 attachment points on the
moving platform. These points are connected by 6 cables.
This conﬁguration is similar to the prototype presented in

B. STATIC PLATFORM POSE ERROR ANALYSIS
The effect of sagging cable on the static behavior of
CDPM is ﬁrstly considered.
1) Deﬁnition of Pose Error: For a traditional rigid-link
manipulator, the platform pose error can be deﬁned by its
Cartesian stiffness matrix, assuming the compliant displace-
ments of the platform is small [5]. However, as the nonlin-
earity of sagging cable, the small displacement assumption
is not valid. Here direct kinematic model is used to deﬁne
pose error.
For a given set of unstrained cable lengths l
0
, the pose
of the platform can be obtained through direct kinematic
model. In the modeling of direct kinematics, different cable
models can be used, such as ideal cable model where the
cable is considered to be inextensible straight line without
mass, spring cable model where the cable is simpliﬁed as
linear spring without mass, and sag cable model where
elastic catenary is employed considering both cable mass
and elasticity. The difference between the pose obtained
through the spring cable model or the sag cable model and
the reference pose obtained through the ideal cable model
deﬁnes the static pose error of the manipulator.

2) Simulation and Experiment: The experimental setup
consists of the 6-DOF cable robot, a precise multi-camera
system for tracking the pose of the platform and a loading
device connected to the center of the platform. The measure-
ment device is the Nikon Metrology K600-10 system based
onthreeCCDlinearcamerasandinfra-redlightactiveLEDs.
Three LEDs are attached to the platform and its poses (both
position and orientation) are measured by the camera. The
system has a position measuring accuracy up to ±37 µm
for a single point. The mass of the platform can be adjusted
from 10:55 kg to 86:35 kg by adding deadweights as shown
in Fig. 5(a). Two sets of anti-rust steel cables are used: 4 and
8 mm in diameter. The cable Young’s modulus is identiﬁed
using a material testing machine. All the cables work within
their linear elastic region. The relevant cable parameters are
given in Table II.

static pose error is strongly non-linear. This non-linearity
is mainly caused by the large cable sag. Beyond a certain
threshold value, the non-linearity of sag model becomes
much weak, thus both sag model and spring model have a
good prediction. These simulations are useful for the design
procedure of a CDPM by choosing the mass of platform, the
cable parameters and the suitable control model.
C. MANIPULATOR DYNAMIC STIFFNESS ANALYSIS
In order to verify the dynamic stiffness model reliability,
tests have been performed to calculate the dynamic response
function of the 6-DOF CDPM. As explained before, we con-
sider the dynamic response function plot as the most useful
output when dealing with resonance identiﬁcation for non-
linear system. Fig. 5(b) represents the experimental setup,
with the platform and an electro-dynamic shaker mounted on
it. Experiments have been performed with a stepped sine ex-
citation,i.e.harmonicexcitationataﬁxedfrequencychanged
step by step (step size: 0:05 Hz) with a stabilization time
period of 8 s at each step. The examined frequency range
is 1?20 Hz because the main interest in suspended cable
robot is to consider the ﬁrst natural frequencies. Over all
the examined frequency range, the shaker delivers a vertical
force proportional to the acceleration amplitude of the small
mass ﬁxed to the mobile device. The presented Frequency
Response Function (FRF) in Fig. 7 has been calculated
referring to the response of the triaxial accelerometer ﬁxed
on the platform and the response of the force sensor. From
this amplitude plot it is possible to identify the resonance
frequencies. The 6-DOF CDPM exhibits several damped
modes in the frequency range studied (Table III). The cor-
relation between experiment results and simulations could
be considered more than acceptable referring to the related
manipulator natural frequencies values (Fig. 7 and Table III).
Obtained results allow to conclude that natural frequencies
estimation of CDPM is accurate even critical aspects remain.
In fact, as one can see in Fig. 7, the correlation between
analytical and experimental FRF in terms of amplitude is not
so good and should be explained by presence of noise test
data (resonances due to ﬁxture device at low frequencies)
and a bad damping estimation. Also, the adopted shaker
inertia has been estimated. It could partially explain the
differences. The same simulation has been done using the
cable model considering out-of-plane motion. But the value
of the identiﬁed natural frequencies does not change much.
The results obtained with the dynamic stiffness model of
the CDPM should be compared with the ones obtained with
the traditional stiffness models [22], [27], which omit the
coupling between the dynamics of the platform and the cable
resonances. From the comparison in Table III, it is indicated
that the dynamics of the cables change the value of natural
frequencies and add new resonances.

V. CONCLUSIONS
This paper focuses on the analysis of the dynamic stiff-
ness matrix of cable-driven manipulators. Dynamic stiffness
matrix of a single sagging cable is introduced in order to
perform the dynamic characteristics of cable manipulators.
Based on this model, dynamic response functions of the ma-
nipulatorarecomputedandnaturalfrequenciesareidentiﬁed.
The proposed approach has been applied on a 6-DOF cable-
suspended parallel manipulator and successfully validated by
experiments. A signiﬁcant correlation between the measured
and computed FRF, and the corresponding natural frequency
deviations conﬁrm the quality of the model. Results show
that cable dynamics has an obvious effect on the manipulator
dynamic behavior. Natural frequencies obtained by different
4059
methods available in literature are also compared with the
experimentalresults. Besides dynamicanalysis, the effectsof
differentstaticcablemodelsontheposeerrorarestudied.We
demonstrate that Irvine’s static sag cable model is necessary
to decrease pose error when platform mass is low, and linear
spring cable model is enough to guarantee the static accuracy
when the platform mass is high. And this threshold value can
be found by the proposed method. Further experiments will
be performed in order to investigate the damping deeper in
detail and actuator stiffness identiﬁcation.
