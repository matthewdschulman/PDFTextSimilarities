Abstract—The inﬁnite dimensionality, varying, uncertainties
or even unknown boundary conditions render the derivation
and - in particular - the identiﬁcation of accurate dynamics
modelsforelasticlinkrobotstediousanderrorprone.Thiscon-
tribution circumvents these challenges by the prior application
of a model-free inner loop oscillation damping controller before
modelling the robot’s dynamics. Then, the damped dynamics of
a multi elastic link robot arm under gravity can be modelled
with high accuracy. An analytical and a data-driven model
for the damped dynamics are proposed and quantitatively
compared. Both models can explain motor currents as well
as link strain measurements in real-time. The paper includes
anexperimentalmodelvalidationwithdifferentpayloadsinthe
entire workspace of the robot.
I. INTRODUCTION
The preservation of rigidity in economic lightweight struc-
tures is a mechanical design challenge. If elasticity is in-
evitable or if intrinsic compliance is an application-speciﬁc
requirement, sophisticated control algorithms have to be
devised in order to suppress oscillations and achieve accurate
positioning. This is the focus of the present literature on the
controlofelasticlinkrobots.However,theexploitationofthe
intrinsic compliance, for example to enable force control, is
often neglected. Experimental works such as [1], [2] are rare.
The inﬂuence of gravity is frequently excluded. Even fewer
papers consider multi-link arms [3], [4] under gravity.
The reason for that is most probably the complexity of the
elasticlinkdynamics. Toaccuratelymodelthedistributedos-
cillatorydynamics,afourthorderpartialdifferentialequation

adds uncertainty to the boundary conditions, a change in the
payload or eventual physical contacts with the environment
introduce arbitrary, generally unknown boundary conditions.
Against this background it is very hard to derive and - in
particular - to identify a holistic dynamics model, which ac-
curately explains the link oscillations in the entire operation
range of a real robot. Most likely such a model lacks real-
time capabilities.

This contribution proposes to circumvent the majority of
the aforementioned challenges for system identiﬁcation of
elastic link robots by prior application of an inner loop oscil-
lation damping controller. It ties in with the authors previous
workonthemodelfreeindependentjointoscillationdamping
controller presented in [4]. The model free controller rapidly
damps link oscillations with tip amplitudes of about 10 cm.
It preserves the speed of motion and enables the elastic
link robot to catch multiple balls subsequently thrown by
a human [7]. On top of the actively damped elastic link
dynamics, this paper presents two real-time capable models
for the remaining dynamics. Both models are identiﬁed
and validated by experiments with multiple payloads under
gravitationalinﬂuence.Theﬁrstmodelisanalyticallyderived
throughtheinvestigationoftheloadtorquedistributioninthe
links. The second one is a data-driven neural network and
models the same output using “problem agnostic” features.
Both models describe the same dynamics structure, work on
exactly the same input/output data and are efﬁciently iden-
tiﬁed using linear regression techniques to explain the per
link strain measurements or the per joint motor currents. An
analytical model is generally preferred for control. However,
the capability of the neural network to approximate arbitrary
nonlinear functions provides a benchmark for the analytical
model. The validation experiments are conducted with the
multi-link experimental setup TUDOR depicted in Fig. 1.
The next section introduces the experimental setup and
exempliﬁes the oscillation damping. Section III derives the
analyical model and explains the applied neural network.
The identiﬁcation experiments and results are discussed in
section IV. The paper concludes and gives an outlook in
section V.

II. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP
The elastic link robot TUDOR is depicted in Fig. 1 along
with the equivalent rigid body kinematics. The actuators are
three brushless DC motors with planetary gears. The gear
ratios are 156:1, 230:1 and 246:1 in the order from the ﬁrst
to the third joint. The vendor speciﬁes a backlash of less
than 1 degree. The joint encoders have a resolution of 500
impulses per revolution. The ﬁrst motor is located in the
cylindrical base and actuates the robot about the vertical axis
1
z by the joint angle?
1
. The second and third motors operate
about the horizontal axes
2
z and
3
z by the joint angles ?
2
and ?
3
. The ﬁxture between the ﬁrst and second joint is
considered to be the ﬁrst link body. The second link body
is a spring steel blade of 4 mm height and 15 mm width.
An identical spring steel blade is mounted to the shaft of
the third joint. The mass of each spring steel blade amounts
to 185 g. Both elastic links are equipped with two pairs
of strain gauges. The pair close to the preceding joints is
used in this work. The blades orientation is selected so that
the deﬂections and oscillations predominantly occur in the
vertical
2
x?
2
y-plane. Therefore, gravitational effects have
to be considered because static deﬂections depending on
payload and joint conﬁguration occur. Depending on the
payload, joint conﬁguration and acceleration proﬁle, the tip
oscillations are in the range of 10 cm. The dominant eigen
frequencies observable on both elastic links range between
1 and 13 Hz accordingly. Based on the author’s previous
work in [4], the oscillations are actively damped using a
cascaded independent joint control concept augmented by a
linear mean deliberated strain feedback. Figure 2 exempliﬁes
the rapid oscillation damping of this scheme.
Figure 1 shows an eye-in-hand mounted camera and
spheres for end effector tracking with an external measure-
ment setup. Within the scope of this work, these devices are
replaced by steel plates with dimensions 80 by 80 by 2mm
3
and mass of 100 g. By adding such steel plates, the dynamics
modelling approaches presented in this work are investigated
for payloads m
L
between 0 and 400 g.
The computer running the controllers and dynamics mod-
els is a standard PC with a 3.8 GHz Pentium 4 processor,
2048 MB RAM, a Humusoft MF624 I/O board and 0.5 ms
sampling rate.

The symbol E denotes the Youngs modulus, I is the area

Consider a uniform massless cantilever as sketched in

at the end. For
a robot link, such a load force originates from the weight of
subsequent links, a payload or a contact force. The torque

Next, consider the same massless cantilever with a con-

such a torque may arise from the weights of distal links and
payloads or as a result from a contact situation. In this case
the torque distribution ?

(x) is constant along the link:

The ﬁrst summand in this equation is constant. The second

conﬁguration of the subsequent links in the chain, this force
remains the same. Orientation changes of the link under
consideration equally scale all components of equation (11)

The key difference between the equations (6) and (15) is

the joint friction. Joint friction torques can not be measured
directly. They have to be observed. The parameters of
equation (2) frequently vary over time due to temperature
dependencies, changes in lubrication, wear and tear [9]. A
link strain referred dynamics model such as equation (14)
assesses the actual mechanical load set free from the joint
friction. The links with the applied strain gauges resemble
load side torque sensors.
C. The Data-driven Model
A fast learning scheme for feed-forward neural networks,
which is known as Extreme Learning Machine (ELM, [10],
seeFig.4),isappliedtomodeltheelasticarmdynamicsfrom
data without prior structural knowledge of the system. In
principle,anyothermachinelearningapproachfornon-linear
function approximation could be applied. However, ELMs
are trained very efﬁciently in one shot by linear regression
and typically achieve excellent generalization results [11].
ELMs combine a non-linear and high-dimensional random
projection of inputs u?R

IV. IDENTIFICATION OF AN ELASTIC LINK
ROBOT ARM
A. Training
Over decades a huge amount of work has been carried out
concerning the generation of optimal excitation signals for
the dynamics identiﬁcation of robot arms [12]. To mention
just a few, the authors of [13] propose to use a bandlimited
periodic sinusoidal parametrized as a ﬁnite Fourier series.
This elegantly allows for simple computation of higher order
measurement derivatives in the presence of noise. Earlier
works investigate excitation trajectory optimization criteria

such as the condition numbers and singular values of the
regression matrices [14].
In this contribution the identiﬁcation of both the an-
alytical model as well as the data-driven model is
basedonamplitude-modulatedpseudo-randombinarystimuli
(APRBS) [15, p. 174] generated for the joint angles. The
APRBS signal is a general purpose excitation stimulus for
the identiﬁcation of non-linear systems. It suits well for the
training of the ELM reference network and results in sufﬁ-
ciently good condition numbers and smallest singular values
oftheregressionmatricesY
i
andY
?
fortheanalyticalmodel.
The stimuli are generated for the second and third joint
individually,butexecuted onbothjointssimultaneously.This
work focuses on the modelling of the damped elastic links.
Therefore, the ﬁrst joint is kept at zero position without
loss of generality. All stimuli have a duration of 80 s.
Responses are recoreded at a sampling rate of 100 Hz and
subsampled to 20 Hz for identiﬁcation. This amounts to N =
1600 data points per stimulus. The modulation bandwidth
for the joint angle amplitudes is 0...1 Hz. The modulated
amplitudes are equally distributed in the entire operating
range provided in Fig. 1. An online joint-space trajectory
planner converts the rectangular shaped joint angle stimuli
into joint trajectories based on a smooth sin
2
acceleration
proﬁle. The proﬁle shows no impulsive jerk and protects
the gears. The maximum acceleration is 200 deg/s
2
. The
maximum speed is 70 deg/s. Figure 5 exempliﬁes two such
joint stimulus responses for the second joint.
In total 10 joint position stimulus responses are recorded
for each payload between m
L
= 0...400 g. The data is
randomly split into 50 % for training and 50 % for testing.
The analytical and data-driven models are trained for each
payload individually.
The analytical as well as the data-driven model share
the same inputs and outputs. The inputs are u =

The bar indicates the mean over all values. A model that
produces a goodness of ﬁt metric above 80% is commonly
accepted as a good model.
For the analytical link strain model basically reaches well
above the goodness of ﬁt metric of 80%. For payload m
L
=
0g it even reaches 90%. Only for m
L
=400g it falls slightly
below the 80%. Figure 6 shows an exemplary identiﬁcation
result for a stimulus part of the test set. The analytical model
as well as the ELM model almost coincide. Generally both
curves reliably track the measurement. Deviations between
the measurements and the model basically originate from
measurement noise and imperfect oscillation damping. The
imperfect oscillation damping is visible in Fig. 6 (a) and
(b) during the small motions around second 5. For heavier
payloads the rapid direction reversal causes the strain peaks
partially explained by the models at 12 s and 18 s.
The joint current models both show lower ﬁt metrics. The
reason for that is suspected to be the reduced signal to noise
ratio of the current measurements along with unmodelled
joint friction effects. Especially the analytical model reacts
quite sensitive to measurement noise during steady states
as visible in Fig. 7 (a) and (b). The reason for that are
the velocity direction dependencies of the coulomb friction
model.Duringmotions,thejointcurrentidentiﬁcationresults

more accurate ﬁt on the training data compared to the
analytical model. On the other hand, the analytical link strain
model shows almost the same 2% improvement compared
to the ELM on the test data. Equivalent observations can
be made for the joint current models. In accordance with
zero centered gaussian error histogramms, the small differ-
ence between analytical and data-driven model additionally
conﬁrms that the proposed analytical model structure is valid
to explain the relevant effects in the strain measurements of
the damped multi elastic link robot. In conclusion, analytical
models–ifavailable–shouldbepreferred,whiledata-driven
models nevertheless constitute valuable alternatives, which
can reduce modeling efforts and computational complexity.
V. CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK
This work shows that, once the structural oscillations are
properly damped by an inner loop controller, the remaining
link strain dynamics of a multi elastic link robot arm can be
modelled using exactly the same model structure as the joint
currentreferredmodelknownfromconventionalrigidrobots.

of the beam partial differential equation based on possibly
unknown boundary conditions and circumvents common
control problems with elastic link robots. The proposed
models can be employed in real-time control such that the
proposed approach is a starting point for future online pay-
load estimation and consequently improved load adaptation
of the inner controllers. This contribution makes a major
step from considering link elasticity “just as a problem” to
enabling the exploitation of intrinsic link compliance for the
developement of force controllers.
