Abstract? This paper proposes a unied active locomotion
mechanism for a capsule-shaped laparoscopic surgical camera
system. The proposed design integrates the camera's xation
and manipulation together by adjusting a 3D rotational mag-
netic eld from a stator outside a patient's body. The stator
generates both torque to rotate the inside rotor dome in all
three dimensions, and force to serve as an anchoring system
that keeps the camera steady during a surgical procedure.
This design eliminates the need for an articulated design and
therefore the integrated motors to signicantly reduce the size
of the camera. A set of stator and rotor designs are developed
and evaluated by simulations and experiments.
I. INTRODUCTION
S
INGLE-PORT surgery is a popular minimally invasive
surgery technique. A single small incision or a natural
orice in human anatomy is adopted for inserting surgical
instruments and laparoscopic cameras through the incision.
Laparoscopic cameras play a key role that feedbacks visual
information to guide surgical procedures. A standard trocar
laparoscopic camera is mostly adopted by pushing a long
stick through an incision. However, a shared incision limits
the dexterity of surgical instruments and the eld of views
of laparoscopic cameras.
Considering the limitations of a conventional laproscopic
camera, it is more desirable to have a surgical camera system
which can be actively controlled for adjusting the camera's
visualization target. One of the research challenges for such
a camera system is the development of its locomotion
mechanism. There are two main problems for designing the
locomotion mechanism: xation that holds the camera in a
stable position and manipulation that actuates the camera to
its desired visualization target direction.
The state-of-the-art techniques for xating the inserted
cameras are categorized as suturing the cameras against
abdominal wall or piercing the cameras into the abdominal
wall by needles; and applying external permanent magnets
(EPMs) to attract the camera magnetically. The manipulation
techniques of the cameras consist of motor-driven, magnet
assisted motor-driven, and magnetic driven techniques. Hu
et al. developed two tethered laparoscopic cameras which
adopt DC servo motors assisted with a worm gear mechanism
to enable a pan motion and tilt motion separately [1], [2].
For the camera's xation of both of their designs, they are
sutured against the abdominal wall. Castro et al. proposed

a wireless miniature anchored laparoscopic camera which
applies a needle to pierce through a patient's abdominal wall
for the camera xation, and is manipulated by two motors
for pan and tilt motions. However, the major drawback of
a suturing or piercing xation is not only does this method
injure the patient's body but it also leads to poor exibility
for translating the device to a new desired location.
Different from the suturing or piercing xation, EPMs
provide an alternative way by magnetic forces. Platt et
al. proposed a ceiling pan/tilt camera design which has a
cylindrical housing with attached magnetic caps at both ends
[3]. An EPM handle allows surgeons to pan the camera
outside patient's abdominal wall while a motor inside the
camera drives itself for a tilt motion. Valdastri et al. designed
a wireless laparoscopic camera system which embeds two
donut-shaped magnets and a motor in a capsule-shaped
housing, and applies an EPM for anchoring the location and
generating a tilt motion of the camera [4]. Two modied
designs of [4] are proposed in [5], [6].
Research efforts so far have addressed separate mech-
anisms for locomotion in the body cavity and pan/tilt of
the camera, which results in bulky articulated systems and
only limited degrees of freedom for locomotion and camera
control. Therefore, a unied active locomotion mechanism is
desired by integrating the xation and manipulation mech-
anisms together. Compared with laparoscopic camera sys-
tems, some state-of-the-art endoscopic systems have applied
magnetic guidance for locomotion of capsule endoscopes.

with a permanent magnet inside the capsule and a spiral
structure outside the capsule, is actuated by an external
rotational magnetic eld [7]. Ciuti et al. proposed a gastroin-
testinal tract inspection endoscopic camera which adopts an
EPM installed robot end-effector to actuate the camera with
four identical axially magnetized cylinder magnets inside
[8]. However, the locomotion mechanisms of the endoscopic
cameras are not suitable to be used in a laparoscopic camera
because the structures of an abdominal cavity and GI tract
are quite different.
Inspired by spherical actuators [9], [10], [11], we propose
a novel motor-free unied active locomotion mechanism for
a laparoscopic camera, as shown in Fig. 1. Similar to a
rotor in a spherical actuator, a set of magnets arranged at
the semi-spherical dome can be magnetically coupled to a
stator placed outside patient's body against or close to the
dermal surface. The coils generate a 3D rotational magnetic
eld, thereby generating both torque to rotate the inside
rotor dome in all three dimensions, and force to serve as
an anchoring system that keeps the camera steady during
a surgical procedure. This design eliminates the need for
an articulated design and therefore the integrated motors
to signicantly reduce the size of the camera. This design
enables the unied translational and rotation controls with
the external device.
However, different from a spherical actuator, the distance
from the camera's rotor to a stator is much longer in the
surgical situation due to the thickness of patient's abdominal
wall. The magnetic force and torque will rapidly reduce
while the distance from a rotor to a stator increases. Only
improving the input currents cannot solve this problem
because of the limited power supply and coils's overheating.
In order to address the problems mentioned above, a set of
rotor and stator designs are proposed and evaluated in this
paper for achieving a reliable laparoscopic camera system.
II. CONCEPT AND ROTOR/STATOR DESIGNS OF
WIRELESS LAPAROSCOPIC CAMERA SYSTEM
The objective of this paper emphasizes on developing
a reliable camera's locomotion mechanism. The remaining
components will be discussed in the future works. In this
section, the conguration of the camera system will be
introduced. And three stator and four rotor designs are
proposed.
A. Congurations of the Camera System
The laparoscopic camera system consists of two parts: a
rotor embedded capsule-shaped camera and a coil winding s-
tator. The camera consists of ve main components, as shown
in Fig. 1: a semi-spherical magnetic head for locomotion,
an illumination and a camera module for visualization, a
battery and a battery management module for power supply,
a wireless communication module for data transmission, and
an inertial sensing module for controlling. Our proposed
camera has two semi-spherical domes, one for housing the
illumination and the camera module; the other for housing
the small cylindrical magnets which serve as the driving unit

mechanism.
in the camera system. The stator consists of multiple coils
which are distributed around a virtual dome to simulate part
of a stator of a spherical motor. The adjustable currents in
the coils provide attracting force and rotating torque to xate
and manipulate the camera.
The working principle of the proposed design can be
illustrated in Fig. 2. The system is designed to enable
two types of motions for the camera system, navigation
(translational control) and orientation control, in addition
to the compensation of the gravity of the camera. The
singularityless orientation control requires torque along three
axes of camera system, and the translation control requires
forces along three axes, with the force along z axis providing
the xation of the camera against the abdominal wall. By
varying the input currents of all coils which coordinate at


g, any desirable rotation can be achieved
for the rotation control of the camera by the generated
rotational magnetic eld. The navigational control of the
camera is provided by moving the passive xture along
the dermal surface with the attractive forces between the
permanent magnets and coils. To simplify the analysis of our
proposed designs, 
r
and 
j
are all referred to a common
reference frame  =fX;Y;Zg by assuming  's origin O
locates at O
r
.
B. Stator Designs
The number of the coils in a stator should be at least four
because of the camera's three degrees of freedom orientation
mobility (1 for camera xation in Z direction, 3 for camera
orientation). But in fact, the rotation around capsule's long
axis is not as important as the other two rotations due to the
camera's symmetry structure along its long axis. Therefore,
the coil's number of a stator can be extended to 3.
Considering a proper size of the stator, the designs consist
of 3, 4, and 5 coils respectively as shown in Fig. 3 (a), (c),
(d). To simplify the stator designs, all the coils share the same
dimension: an outer radiusR, an inner radiusr, a coil height
h and a tilt angle . Taking the 3 coil stator as an example,
the initial setting assumes all the coils are tangent to each
other in the XY plane with = 0, as shown in Fig. 3(a).
2450
Fig. 3. Three stator designs.
The rotating axises are xed at the bottoms of the coils. To
calculate , the coil to rotor distanced has to be determined.
According to the reference [12], the average thickness of the
abdominal wall is about 30 mm. For compensating a titled
depth of the stator,d is set as 40 mm. As illustrated in Fig. 3
(b) where OA = d, AB = L, can be calculated by
arcsin (L=d). Considering the weak magnetic ux density
generated by air-core coils, soft iron rods are inserted coils
in the coils for producing stronger magnetic eld. Similar
calculations are applied to 4 and 5 coils stators in Fig. 3(c)
and (d). In the 5 coil stator design, there is no tilt angle on
the central coil.
C. Rotor Designs
For designing the rotor, a set of axially magnetized cylin-
der magnets are embedded in the semi-spherical dome of
the camera. In this paper, four rotor designs are proposed
as shown in Fig. 4. The red magnets represent the north
poles pointing outside or upside while the blue ones point
to the opposite ways. Rotor design 1 and 4 in Fig. 4(a),
(d) both include a disc magnet. It is worth noting that a
disc magnet and a cylinder magnet can both be considered
as a magnetic dipole in the far eld. This fact will be
used for developing the analytical model of the locomotion
mechanism in Section III. The rotor 1 in Fig. 4(a) consists of
12 small cylinder magnets that are mounted along the equator
at the longitude of every 60

, along the latitude of 60

at the
longitude of every 60

. Rotor 2 in Fig. 4(b) consists of 13
small cylinder magnets which are mounted along the equator
at the longitude of every 45

, along the latitude of 45

at
the longitude of every 90

, and one on the north pole. Rotor
3 shown in Fig. 4(c) is similar to model 2 with the only
difference that the magnets are mounted along the latitude
of 45

at the longitude of every 45

. Rotor 4 adds a disc
magnet based on model 3.
D. Design Parameters
The purpose of proposing different designs aims at seeking
reasonable models and parameters for a reliable camera
Fig. 4. Four rotor designs.
locomotion mechanism. Therefore, a set of parameters of the
stator and rotor has to be specied. The outer radiusR of the
coils ranges from 8 mm to 30 mm, the inner radius and coil
height are xed at 5 mm and 30 mm respectively. The reason
for xing the inner radius and coil height is because changing
the two parameters will not signicantly affect the generated
force and torque compared with the outer radiusR according
to our preliminary experiments. Considering the dimension
of the camera whose dome has a 8 mm inner radius and com-
mercially available cylinder magnets, the radius and height
of a cylinder magnet are selected as 1:27 mm and 2:54 mm
separately with residual magnetization as 1:32 Tesla. The disc
magnet is chosen as 1:59 mm height and 8 mm radius with
its residual magnetization as 1:43 Tesla.
The current density in the coils has a major impact on the
generated force and torque. The maximum current carrying
capacity of a coil is determined by a copper wire's cross
sectional area. In this paper, we select copper wire's with a
cross sectional area as 1 mm
2
. In terms of experiential data,
a 1 mm
2
copper wire can carry less than 8 A for long-time
duty and less than 16 A for short-time duty. The current
carrying capacity also depends on insulation materials
and cooling conditions. For testing our designs, we safely
assume the maximum current carrying capacityjI
max
j is 5 A.
III. MODELING OF THE UNIFIED LOCOMOTION
MECHANISM
The objective of building the analytical model of the
camera system's locomotion mechanism is twofold: to re-
alize real-time dynamic control of the laparoscopic camera
by changing the input currents; and to analyze the control
capabilities of various rotor and stator designs. In this
paper, we focus on evaluating the control capabilities of
our proposed designs based on the analytical model. The
central problem of developing the analytical model is how
to calculate the force and torque generated on the rotor.
The techniques applied to spherical motors for deriving their
dynamic analytical model are all based on Lorentz law due to
2451
the air-core coils [9], [10], [11]. However, in our application
the thickness of the abdominal wall is much greater than
the air gap in the spherical motors. Compared with air core
coils, iron-core coils can provide stronger magnetic eld
because of the high magnetic permeability of soft iron.
Thus in this paper, both air-core and iron-core coils will
be considered. The Lorentz force law can not handle the
analytical model with iron-core coils. Considering the shapes
of the cylinder/disc magnets in the semi-spherical dome of
the camera, the magnetic moment of each magnet can be
described as M. The force and torque applied on a magnet
with its magnetic moment M can be represented by
T = M B; (1)
F = (Mr)B; (2)
where B is the magnetic ux density at the location of M
[13]. To analyze the generated force and torque, the rotor's
magnetic moment M and the stator's magnetic ux density
B have to be calculated.
A. Stator's Magnetic Flux Density B
For modeling the stator's magnetic ux density, a set
of local coordinate systems of the coils are set as 

where N is the number of the coils. The representations of
M and B in (1) and (2) have to share the same coordinate
system. Therefore, a reference frame  = fX;Y;Zg is
adopted for establishing the relationship between the stator's
coordinates and rotor's coordinates. The transformation from
local coil coordinates 

is the coil's magnetic ux density in its local

core options for the coils, it is preferred to have a common
representation of the coil's magnetic ux density. Finite
Element Method (FEM) is able to obtain accurate solutions
of the coil's magnetic ux density by building extra ne
meshes. However, the expensive computational time of FEM
fails itself to serve in a real time application. A magnetic
dipole model tting method proposed in [14], which adopts
the coil's axial magnetic ux density simulation results from
Finite Element Method as the tting data, is applied for
estimating the parameter p and l in

B. Rotor's Magnetic Moment M
The complex structures of the rotor designs make it
difcult to express the rotor's magnetic moment in one piece.
Because the forces and torques applied on each individual
magnet can be superimposed in a linear way, a strategy for
expressing the rotor's magnetic moment is to establish the
relationship between each magnet's magnetic moment and
the magnetic ux density generated from each coil.

where P

which will be used to represent M and B in a common
coordinates in order to calculate the force and torque in (1)
and (2).
C. Force and Torque Calculation
Because magnetic forces contribute part of magnetic
torques, shifting the magnet's rotational centers to the semi-
spherical rotor's center is necessary for superimposing the
force-contributed torques generated on different magnets.
According to what we have discussed in Section III-A, III-B
2452
and (1)-(2), the unit force and torque generated on the rotor
from a single coil j are formulated as

For deriving the complete force and torque equations, F

Considering the force analysis of the laparoscopic camera
inside a patient's abdominal cavity, the forces applied on the
camera can be categorized as the electromagnetic force F,
the membrane force f
m
from the squeezed abdominal cavity
wall tissue, the liquid friction force f
l
while the camera is
transitioning and rotating, and the camera's gravity force
mg. The electromagnetic force F will balance all the other
forces. Assume p is the camera's location in the reference
coordinates . In accordance to Newton's law, the dynamic
model of the camera can thus be expressed as
m p = F  f
l
  f
m
 mg: (16)
It is important to note in (16) that the Z component of the
electromagnetic force f
z
will lead to the tissue deformation
and subsequently changes f
l
and f
m
. To maximally eliminate
the torques generated from f
l
and f
m
when the camera is
steering, one control strategy to deal with this problem is that
before manipulating the camera, reducef
z
for alleviating the
effects of f
l
and f
m
on the camera. After actuating, increase
f
z
for applying the torques generated from f
l
and f
m
to
balance the torque from the camera's gravity force.
IV. SIMULATION AND EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
In this section, the prototype designs of our proposed
laparoscopic camera system are fabricated and evaluated
based on the developed analytical model of the locomotion
mechanism. To analyze the analytical model of stator's
magnetic ux density, the data from a FEM software is
adopted as a benchmark. The maximum output forces and
torques of different designs are compared in accordance
with analytical solutions. At last, the generated forces and
torques of the fabricated stator and rotor are tested by real
force/torque sensors.

A. Simulation Results
1) Stator's Magnetic Flux Density Evaluation: For e-
valuating the analytical model of the iron-core stator's
magnetic ux density developed in Section III-A, a set of
FEM simulation data obtained from COMSOL Multiphysics
4.3a (COMSOL Inc., Sweden) are used to compare with
our analytical results. As shown in Fig. 5, the analytical
magnetic ux density of the stator is estimated by FEM. The
parametersm andl for the magnetic dipole model in (5) are
calculated as m = 2:98 Am

 5 A  5 A. With a xed rotor to coil distance as d =
40 mm, we testify the coil radius 10 mm, 20 mm, 30 mm on
the 3 coil stator, 10 mm, 20 mm, 25 mm on the 4 coil stator,
and 8 mm, 10 mm, 15 mm on the 5 coil stator. The reason for
not applying the same set of radius on all the stator models
is because a large radius R for 4 and 5 coil stator will lead
 to approach to 90

. It is shown in Table I, II and III
that an iron-core stator can generate much greater force and
torque than an air-core stator under the same set of design
parameters. To clarify the evaluation results, the iron-core
experimental results are visualized as shown in Fig. 6. The
maximum force and torque inx andy directions are rapidly
increasing when outer radiusR and tilt angle are growing.
But the force component in z direction drops down after the
tilt angle pasts over 45

. The 5 coil stator is a special case
which shows that = 48:6

still keeps a growing trend of
F
zmax
value due to the effect of central coil. The torque
valuesT
z
along the camera's axis have ae
 18
number scale
which means the camera cannot be rotated around itsZ
r
axis.
This fact is actually reasonable because in a real application
the camera will not be required to rotate around its own Z
r
axis.
Comparing the three models in Table I, II and III, the
3 coils iron-core stator with R = 20 mm and the 4 coils
iron-core stator withR = 20 mm; 25 mm provide reasonable
forces and torques in all x, y, and z directions. In a real
surgery situation, a small tilt angle design is preferred
because a larger leads to a greater distance from the rotor
to the stator. Therefore, the 3 coil stator withR = 20 mm is
selected as a candidate design and used in the rotor models
evaluation due to its good balance of coil tilt angle and
generated forces and torques.
Fig. 7. The fabricated rotors and stator.
3) Rotor's Design Evaluation: Table IV shows the evalua-
tion results of four rotor designs based on the 3 coil iron-core
stator withR = 20 mm. Rotor 1 and 4 generate greater forces
and torques than those generated in the rotor 2 and 3 due to
the disc magnet. Rotor 3 has a better performance than rotor
model 2. To analyze if the design of our active locomotion
system works well, the camera dynamics and abdominal
wall tissue model have to be involved. Being evaluated by
the Solidworks software, the camera weights approximately
15 grams, and the distance from the gravity center to rotor's
center is about 10 mm. The threshold force and torque to
actuate the camera are 0:147 N and 0:001 47 Nm which
indicates the rotor 1 and 4 are capable of providing enough
force and torque for the locomotion mechanism.
B. Camera System Fabrication
1) Rotor Fabrication: Since the objective of this paper
is to develop the locomotion mechanism, only the rotor is
designed and fabricated in the capsule-shaped camera with
leaving out the other components. According to the analytical
evaluations of the rotors in Table IV, rotor 4 is selected due
to yielding the best force and torque performance among all
four rotor designs. The sizes of the small cylinder magnets
and the disc magnet are 1=10

and sufcient force and torque for manipulating the camera.
Therefore, in this paper we fabricate this stator design for
experimental test, as shown in Fig. 7. The coils are wound
by 600 turns copper ware with 1 mm
2
cross sectional area.
The height, outer radius and inner radius of each of the coils
are 40 mm, 20 mm, and 5 mm respectively. The resistance
of each coil is about 1:3 
. The soft iron rods applied in
the coils are 9:5 mm in diameter and 60 mm in height with
their maximum magnetic permeability 2000 H/m. In order
to provide controllable independent current inputs for each
of the coils, three DC power supplies (Mastech HY5020E)
with a maximum output voltage 50 V and maximum current
output 20 A are adopted for driving the camera's transitional
and rotational motions.
C. Force and Torque Measurement Experiments
For validating the analytical model and the maximum
generated forces/torques, experiments are set up based on
our fabricated rotor and stator. The magnetic force and torque
are measured by Barrett WAM arm's Six-Axis Force/Torque
sensor with 50 mN force sensing resolution and 1:5 mNm
torque sensing resolution. In both of the force and torque
measurements, the z axis of the rotor Z
r
is assigned to
coincide with the symmetry axis of the stator. And the
distance from the coils to the center of the rotor is set as
40 mm. For measuring the magnetic force and torque, the
locomotion mechanism is placed upside down, as shown in
Fig. 8. An ?L? shaped lever arm connects the rotor model 4
on one side, and is attached to the F/T sensor on the other
side.
The forces along Z
r
axises are measured under vari-
ous current input limits from 0 to 5 A. And the torques
are measured around X
r
axis. Due to the torque sensing
resolution, the F/T sensor is not capable of recording the
generated torque according to the simulation results in Table
I?IV. Therefore, the lever arm is used to amplify torque
measurements for compensating the limits of the sensor.
Figure. 9 compares the measurements and simulation results
of the generated force and torque. For measuringF

coils are applied the same current value and direction ranging
from 0 to 5 A. In order to measure F

of the coil on Y

V. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper, we propose an innovative active locomo-
tion mechanism for a wireless laparoscopic camera. The
locomotion mechanism naturally enables a unied control
of transition and orientation for the camera by varying the
input current of stator's coils. This design eliminates the need
for an articulated design and therefore the integrated motors
to signicantly reduce the size of the camera. Three stator
designs and four rotor designs are developed and evaluated
by simulations and experiments for testing manipulation
capability of different designs. According to the simulation
and experimental results, our proposed designs are able to
provide sufcient force and torque to translate and rotate a
laparoscopic camera inside patient's abdominal cavities.
Based on the proposed locomotion mechanism designs
of camera system, the other components such as a camera
module, batteries, a wireless module, inertial sensors will
be designed and fabricated in the laparoscopic camera. For
manipulating the camera in a surgical situation, a closed loop
controller will be developed for the camera system to enable
robust and accurate transitional/orientation controls. Various
thickness of abdominal walls will be adopted to evaluate the
laparoscopic camera system.
