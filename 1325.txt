Abstract— Human running motion can be modeled by a 
spring loaded inverted pendulum (SLIP). However, this model, 
despite being widely used in robotics, does not include 
human-like pelvic motion. In this study, we show that the pelvis 
actually contributes to the increase in jumping force and 
absorption of landing impact, both of which findings can be used 
to improve running robots. On the basis of the analysis of human 
running motion, we propose a new model named SLIP
2
 (spring 
loaded inverted pendulum using pelvis). This model is composed 
of a body mass, a pelvis, and leg springs; the model can control 
its springs during running by use of pelvic movement in the 
frontal plane. To achieve hopping and running motions, we 
developed pelvis oscillation control, running velocity control, 
and stabilization control using an upper body, as control 
methods. We also developed a new hopping robot using the 
SLIP
2
 model. To evaluate the proposed model and control 
methods, we performed hopping and running simulations. The 
simulation results showed that the SLIP
2
 model successfully 
achieves hopping and running motions. The hopping robot was 
also able to accomplish hopping motion. The simulation results 
also showed that the difference between the pelvic rotational 
phase and the phase of oscillation of the mass vertical 
displacement affects the jumping force. In particular, the results 
revealed that the human-like pelvic rotation contributes to the 
absorption of landing impact and to the increase in takeoff forces, 
which validates our observations in human motion analysis.

I. INTRODUCTION 
Several researchers have performed motion capture 
experiments to realize human motion. In some cases, however, 
these experiments pose a risk of injury, because of which it is 
not possible to perform them. To resolve this problem, we, the 
Waseda University research group, have proposed that a 
biped humanoid robot that can mimic human motion is useful 
for the research of human science and sports science. When 
the humanoid robot realizes human-like motion or uses 
instruments, we can measure various data of the robot’s 
motion and compare human-like motions with those that do 
not mimic humans. This measurement and comparison will be 
useful for the verification of human motion’s characteristics 
and testing instruments. 
We have previously developed a biped humanoid robot 
named WABIAN-2R (WAseda BIpedal humANoid – No. 2 
Refined) to mimic human motion and mechanisms. Its height 
is 1480 mm and weight is 63.8 kg, and it has 41 DOF (degrees 
of freedom). WABIAN-2R can perform a stretched knee gait 
with a 2-DOF (roll, yaw) pelvis [1-3]. However, this robot is 
limited only to walking. 
Recent research on biped humanoid robots has contributed a 
few running robots. For example, ASIMO can run at a speed 
of 9 km/h [4]. Further, Toyota’s biped humanoid robot can 
also run, using a ZMP (zero moment point)-based running 
control system [5]. Niiyama et al. developed the athlete robot, 
which has a human-like musculoskeletal system built to 
achieve dynamic motion such as running [6]. The biped robot 
MABEL has leg elasticity that originates from a flat spring, 
and it can run the fastest out of all the presently available 
biped robots, attaining a speed of 11 km/h with axial 
constraints on the Y-axis [7]. However, none of these robots 
mimic human running characteristics. 
Some important characteristics of human running have been 
identified by researchers in the field of sports science and 
biomechanics, such as head stabilization [8], moment 
compensation using the upper body and arms [9], and leg 
stiffness [10]. However, an important characteristic that has 
not yet been reported is that a human’s pelvic movement in the 
frontal plane can help to increase takeoff forces and absorb 
landing impacts. In this paper, we report this finding on the 
basis of an analysis of human motion. Then, based on this 
finding, we propose a running model that is a combination of a 
traditional SLIP (spring loaded inverted pendulum) model and 
a pelvis. The proposed model, called SLIP
2
 (spring loaded 
inverted pendulum using pelvis), is composed of a body mass, 
a pelvis, and leg springs. We then describe running control

 model. We also discuss 
the influence of the pelvis on the absorption of landing impact 
and increase in takeoff force. We successfully simulated 
hopping and running motions using SLIP

, and completed a 
hopping experiment with a real hopping robot. We present 
these simulations and experiment here.  
This paper is organized as follows. In section II, we describe 
human pelvis rotation, the SLIP
2
 model, and running control 
methods. In section III, we describe the development of the 
hopping robot, and in section IV, we present experimental 
results. Finally, in section V, we present the conclusions and 
discuss future work. 
II. DEVELOPMENT OF SLIP
2
 MODEL AND RUNNING CONTROL 
A. Pelvic Movement Analysis 
In an attempt to identify the characteristics of human 
running motion that could be useful for robot design, we 
conducted a series of motion capture experiments with human 
subjects. We asked three subjects (gender: male, height: 1730 
± 70 mm, weight: 61 ± 9 kg) to perform regular running 
motion and measured the data 10 times for each subject. The 
results suggested that pelvic movement in the frontal plane 
could aid human running.  
Fig. 1 shows the average pelvic movement in the frontal 
plane during the stance phase of running at 4 m/s. The pelvis 
levels off at an angle of 0deg. The measurement shows that 
the angle of the pelvis is 5.9deg at heel strike-the idling leg is 
lowered at this point. The pelvis then rotates up to 6.9deg until 
landing of the sole. Next, the idling leg lowers down. After 
that, the pelvis rotates in the opposite direction up to -5.1deg 
until takeoff using the toe. That is to say, the pelvis rotates to 
lower the idling leg, and then rotates in the opposite direction 
to raise it. From this result, we assume that the pelvic 
movement in the frontal plane can help to increase the takeoff 
force and absorb the landing impact. The pelvis movement at 
landing can help to absorb the landing impact, and the 
subsequent movement can help to increase the takeoff force. 
 
B. SLIP
2
 Model 
In previous works, human running was modeled as SLIP [10], 
whereas human walking was modeled as an inverted 
pendulum [4]. The SLIP model is composed of a body mass 
and a spring leg and is based on the linear relationship 
between the ground reaction force and the vertical 
displacement of the body during running [11] [12] [15]. In this 
model, in the flight phase, human movement is modeled as a 
parabolic motion of a mass point. This model describes human 
running in a simple, straightforward way. However, humans 
lose energy by landing impact and owing to the leg's muscles. 
This lost energy should be compensated for by an actuator, 
which was assumed to be the leg's muscle in previous studies. 
However, in terms of similarity with the actual human body, 
the SLIP model does not model the pelvis. Based on the 
human motion analysis presented in the previous section, we 
propose a new model, SLIP
2
 (shown in Fig. 2), which is 
composed of an upper body, a pelvis, and spring legs. During 
stance, human motion is modeled by SLIP
2
, whereas during 
flight, it is modeled as a parabola. 
 
C. Pelvis Oscillation Control 
The pelvis oscillation control method is used for storing 
energy. In this method, the pelvis is controlled using the 
natural frequency calculated from the mass weight and leg 
stiffness in the stance phase, with the objective of attaining 
sufficient jumping power. The hip roll axis is controlled to 
equal the pelvis roll axis and keep the leg vertical. The pelvic 
movement is modeled as a linear displacement, and the motion 
equation of the Z-axis is given by

In the SLIP model, the mass is located on the hip joint (Fig. 
3(a)). A human's center of gravity is actually some distance 
away from the hip joint, meaning that a moment generated by 
the ground reaction force makes the model unstable. To 
overcome this problem, we developed a stabilization control 
method using the upper body to compensate for this moment, 
by controlling the hip joint in the stance phase (Fig. 3(b)).

III. DEVELOPMENT OF HOPPING ROBOT 
A. Requirements for New Hopping Robot 
Next, we aim to develop a hopping robot that can 
successfully execute hopping motion using real hardware. We 
determined the requirements for velocity and torque in the hip 
roll joint on the basis of human running data acquired by Reed 
et al. [13]. We also fixed the requirements for the velocity of 
the pelvis roll joint based on human running data acquired by 
Schache et al. [14]. To the best of our knowledge, no work has 
previously been conducted on the torque of the pelvis roll 
joint. We calculated these requirements by substituting 
appropriate values in the motion equation (1). The 
requirements for the velocity and torque of the pelvis and hip 
roll joints are summarized in Table I. 
 
B. Design of New Hopping Robot 
We chose a 150-W DC motor (Maxon Co., Ltd.), a timing 
belt, and a harmonic drive to actuate the pelvis and hip joints. 
To adjust the mass, weights can be mounted on the upper part

 Under the following conditions: 
• Leg spring is free-length. 
• Length of a leg’s linear actuator is 0 m. 
 
of the robot. As the leg’s spring, we selected a compression 
spring, shaft, set collar, and linear bush. Owing to this 
mechanism, the compression spring is not detached from its 
upper and lower parts when the spring is free-length. In 
addition, we can change to other compression springs by 
adjusting the distance between the set collar and the linear 
bush. We fixed the range of the spring's stiffness based on 
previous research [15]. The robot motion is restricted to the 
vertical direction with linear guides. The developed hopping 
robot with a pelvis is shown in Fig. 6.  
IV. EXPERIMENTS 
To evaluate the SLIP
2
 model and the running control 
methods, we simulated them with a physical modeling and 
simulation tool, MapleSim (Cybernet Systems Co., Ltd.). 
A. Hopping Simulation 
We successfully performed a hopping simulation using the 
SLIP
2
 model. The simulation result shown in Fig. 7, and the 
mass height in the hopping simulation is shown in Fig. 8. 
When the leg spring is free-length, the mass height is 1 m. 
Therefore, the jumping height from the ground is more than 
0.04 m. 
 
B. Difference in Pelvic Rotational Phase 
As noted previously, the pelvis rotates to lower the idling leg, 
and then rotates in the opposite direction to raise it. From this 
information, we assume that the pelvic movement in the 
frontal plane during landing can help to absorb the landing 
impact, and that the subsequent movement can help to 
increase the takeoff force. However, this pelvic rotation to 
raise the idling leg is greater than the rotation required to 
lower it. This is because the pelvic rotational phase is different 
from the oscillation of the vertical displacement of the mass.  
To analyze the influence of the difference in pelvic rotational 
phase on the absorption of landing impacts and the increase in 
takeoff forces, we performed simulations wherein the SLIP
2
 
model free-falls from the height of the foot from the ground, 
i.e., 0.1 m, and jumps using the pelvis oscillation control after

is 0, π/8, π/4, 3π/8, and π/2. The 
mass height is shown in Fig. 9, and its vertical acceleration is 
shown in Fig. 10. The jumping height increases with 
increasing phase difference of the pelvic rotation. Moreover, 
the maximum vertical acceleration of the mass increases with 
increasing difference of the pelvic rotational phase. In 
particular, the human pelvic rotation is similar to the phase 
difference of π/4. When the phase difference is π/2, the pelvis 
rotates to raise the idling leg without lowering. Comparison of 
these two cases shows that the maximum vertical acceleration 
of the mass with a π/4 phase difference is 6% less than that 
with a π/2 phase difference. This suggests that the difference 
in the pelvic rotational phase has an influence on the 
absorption of landing impacts and the increase in takeoff 
forces. In particular, the human-like pelvic rotation 
contributes to absorb landing impact and to increase takeoff 
force. 
 
C. Hopping Experiment 
We performed a hopping experiment using the developed 
hopping robot. The conditions for the experiment were the 
same as those for the hopping simulation. Fig. 11 shows the 
results of the experiment, and Fig. 12 shows the mass height 
for the hopping experiment. The robot could not hop when the 
pelvis amplitude was 0.5deg. However, it could hop when this 
amplitude was 2deg.The mass height became higher as the 
amplitude became larger. However, when the amplitude was 
changed to 4deg, the height decreased after a number of jumps. 
We assume that this is because of the difference between the 
mass height and the pelvis oscillation. We had measured the 
mass height by a wire encoder, and used it to detect landing. 
However, the mass height became inaccurate when the robot 
jumped too high. In the future, we intend to improve landing 
detection by using a force sensor. 
 
D. Running Simulation 
Finally, we simulated running to evaluate the pelvis 
oscillation control and foot placement control with axial 
constraints on the Y-axis. Fig. 13 shows the simulation results, 
and Fig. 14 shows the transition of running velocity. From the 
reference running velocity (1.5 m/s in 5 s and 2.0 m/s in 5 s), 
we confirmed the effectiveness of the foot placement control. 
V. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORKS 
2317
  
In this paper, we described an analysis of human motion 
focused on pelvic movement in the frontal plane and the 
development of the SLIP
2
 model and a running control 
scheme. From this analysis, we concluded that the pelvic 
movement in the frontal plane can help to increase takeoff 
forces and absorb landing impacts. We then developed a new 
model, called the SLIP
2
 model, composed of the SLIP model 
and a pelvis, and running control methods, which include 
pelvis oscillation control, foot placement control, and 
stabilization control using the upper body. To evaluate the 
SLIP
2
 model and the running control methods, we simulated 
hopping and running motions. We also developed a hopping 
robot using the SLIP
2
 model and were able to successfully 
replicate the hopping experiment with a real robot. Moreover, 
we verified the influence of different pelvic rotational phases 
through simulations in using the SLIP
2
 model. The results 
showed that the pelvic rotational phase difference has an 
influence on the absorption of landing impacts and the 
increase in takeoff forces. In particular, human-like pelvic 
rotation contributes to the absorption of landing impact and 
the increase in the takeoff force. 
In the near future, we intend to model the pelvic movement in 
the horizontal plane. In addition, humans are able to run at 
high speeds because the moment generated by the ground 
reaction force and their leg movement are both compensated 
for by the use of their upper body and arms. We intend to 
combine the SLIP
2
 model with an upper body to construct a 
new full-bodied model that will mimic this human 
characteristic. Finally, we will develop a new stabilization 
control method using the upper body and arms.
