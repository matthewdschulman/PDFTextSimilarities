Attitude Stabilization Without Angular Velocity Measurements
L. Benziane, A. Benallegue and A. Tayebi
AbstractÑWe propose a velocity-free attitude stabilization
scheme in which neither the angular velocity nor the instan-
taneous measurements of the attitude are used in the feedback,
only body vector measurements are needed. To overcome the
lack of angular velocity, a Þrst order linear auxiliary system
based directly on these vector measurements is introduced.
Almost global asymptotic stability results are obtained. Also, in
order to adjust properly the gains of the controller, an analysis
of their effect on the closed-loop dynamics was performed.
The effectiveness and performance of the proposed solution are
illustrated via simulation results where some comparison with
existing previous work are given.
I. INTRODUCTION
The problem of rigid body attitude estimation and control
remains until today an active research topic. This is due to
the large Þeld of applications such as robotics, unmanned
aerial vehicles (UAVs), satellites, marine vehicles, etc.
Since 1965, when Wahba [1] posed the problem of deter-
mining the attitude using vector measurements as an opti-
mization problem, several innovative solutions in the Þeld of
attitude estimation and control have emerged. First solutions
to control the attitude were used in robotics with several
orientation representations.
As mentioned in the recent survey paper [2], the literature
on orientation control can be classiÞed into two categories;
solutions using geometric framework to represent the attitude
in SO(3) orS
2
[2], [3], [4] and those usingR
3
orS
3
[5], [6],
[7], [8]. Some of these works propose a combined estimation-
control solutions [3], [9], [10], others take into consideration
special cases like in [11] where an asymptotic convergence
of the attitude control is achieved without knowledge of the
inertia matrix. Many other works dealt with the problem
of attitude stabilization without using the angular velocity
information. In this case, some of them exploited the passivity
of the system such as [12], [13], [14], [15], [16]. Others use
an auxiliary system to bypass the lack of the angular velocity,
such as [17].
In almost all results dealing with the case of attitude
control without angular velocity, the Òinstantaneous measure-
ments of the attitudeÓ is used in the control law. As there is
no sensor that directly measures the attitude of a rigid body,
the aforementioned velocity-free controllers require some
kind of attitude observer relying on the available direction
sensors. However, all the most efÞcient dynamic attitude

tems Laboratory - LISV, Velizy, France. A. Tayebi is with the De-

estimation algorithms make use of the body measurements
and the angular velocity information to estimate the attitude
of the rigid body. To overcome this problem, a velocity-free
attitude control scheme, that incorporates explicitly vector
measurements instead of the attitude itself, has been proposed
for the Þrst time in [17]. As claimed in [17], this class of
controllers can be qualiÞed as the class of true velocity-free
attitude controllers.
The attitude control scheme presented in this work can be
regarded as an extension version of [17]. The main difference
is the use of an auxiliary system in terms of the body vector
measurements, deÞned on R
3
, rather than using an auxiliary
system deÞned onS
3
. This leads to reduce the set of unstable
equilibria of the closed loop dynamics. In order to adjust
properly the gains of the controllers, an analysis of their effect
on the closed-loop dynamics was conducted for the previous
and current works. This is based on the linearized systems
around the stable equilibrium point.
II. PRELIMINARIES, ASSUMPTIONS AND PROBLEM
FORMULATION
A. Preliminaries
In this paper, we use two attitude representations. The Þrst
one is the rotation matrix R, which provides a unique and
global parametrization of the orientation. It is an element of
SO(3) (the special orthogonal group) deÞned by SO(3) =
{R ? R
3?3
| R
T
R = RR
T
= I
3?3
,det(R)=1}, where
I
3?3
is the 3-by-3 identity matrix. The second representation
is the unit-quaternion Q=(q

T
)

such
that q

q=1. It is an element of the three-sphere S
3
embedded inR
4
and deÞned asS
3
= {Q ?R
4
| Q
T
Q=1}.
The rotation matrix R is related to the unit-quaternion Q
through the Rodriguez formula R = R(Q). The mapping R
from S
3
to SO(3) is given by
R(Q)= I
3?3
+2q

S(q)+2S(q)

where S represents the mapping R
3
? so(3), with so(3)
being the Lie algebra of SO(3) denoted by so(3) = {S ?
R
3?3
| S
T
= ?S}. It is the set of skew symmetric matrices.
The mapping S :R

B. Assumptions
Let B be an orthonormal body-attached frame with its
origin at the center of gravity of the rigid-body and I be
the inertial reference frame on earth. We have the following
assumptions:
¥ Consider n (n ³ 2) measurable b
i
vectors in B,
corresponding to n Þxed r
i
vectors in I, such that
b
i
= R
T
r
i
.
¥ Suppose that at least two vectors among them are non
collinear.
¥ The angular velocity vector ? is non-measurable.
¥ The desired rigid body attitude is deÞned by the constant
rotation matrix R
d
, relates an inertial vector r
i
to its
corresponding vector in the desired frame, i.e., b
d
i
=
R
T
d
r
i
, with
ú
b
d
i
= 0. The equivalent constant desired
unit-quaternion Q
d
is deÞned as R
d
= R(Q
d
).
C. Problem formulation
The rigid body attitude kinematics, in terms of rotation
matrix R ? SO(3), are given by
ú
R(t)= R(t)S(?(t)) and
in terms of the unit-quaternion Q ?S
3
,by
ú
Q(t)=

(q

(t)I +S(q(t)))?(t)
	
, (2)
with ? being the angular velocity of the rigid body expressed
in B. The dynamics of the body vectors b
i
(t)= R
T
(t)r
i
(i=1,ááá ,n) are given by
ú
b
i
(t)= ?S(?(t))b
i
(t),i=1,ááá ,n. (3)
The rigid body rotational dynamics are governed by
J ú ?(t)= ?S(?(t))J?(t)+?(t), (4)
where J ? R
3?3
is a symmetric positive deÞnite constant
inertia matrix of the rigid body with respect to the body-
attached frame B. ?(t) is the external torque applied to the
system expressed in B.
The problem addressed in this work is the design of
an attitude stabilization control ?(t) based only on inertial
measurements, without using the angular velocity ? in the
feedback.
III. DESIGN OF THE VELOCITY-FREE ATTITUDE
CONTROLLER
First, let us deÞne the orientation error by
ø
R(t)=
R(t)R
T
d
(t) which corresponds to the quaternion error
ø
Q(t)=
Q(t)Q

by

If we put ø p = R

(i=1,ááá ,n), which can be rewritten using
(1) and the fact that ø p = R
T
d
ø q as
ø
b
i
= ?2(ø q

I ?S(ø p))S(ø p)b

(7)
One of the main contributions of this work is the deÞnition
of the auxiliary system which is simply a linear Þrst-order
Þlter on b

where?> 0 and b

can be chosen arbitrarily.
Now, the error of the auxiliary system is deÞned by
÷
b

?b

. Using (8), (3), (7), the fact that b
i
=

and
the property S(x)y = ?S(y)x leads to the following error
dynamics
ú

where B

i
(t)=
(I ?2(ø q

(t)I ?S(ø p(t)))S(ø p(t)))b

. Equation (9) can be
rewritten using the state vector deÞned by ?(t):=
(

T

where ? = det(W)det(J

are positive
deÞnite, it is clear that?> 0. Consequently, det(A) > 0.
Due to the fact that the determinant is nothing other than the
product of all eigenvalues and that A has seven eigenvalues,
one can conclude that there exist at least one eigenvalue
with positive real part. Therefore, (18) is unstable, and so
is ½
2
. Finally, since ½
2
has zero Lebesgue measure, one can
conclude that ½
1
is almost globally asymptotically stable.
V. ANALYSIS OF THE EFFECT OF THE CONTROLLERS
GAINS
As mentioned before, this is an extension of the work
presented in [17]. In what follows we name the controller
presented in [17] as Òprevious controllerÓ or Òprevious workÓ.
Knowing that the proposed controller uses more control
gains, the importance of this section is to give an analysis
of the effect of control gains on the closed-loop dynamics
for the previous and current works. This allowed us to adjust
the gains based on the position of the poles and zeros of the
linearized system around the stable equilibrium point.
A. Closed loop dynamics linearization of the previous work
The closed loop dynamics of the previous work can be
written around ½
1p
=(÷ q, ø q, ?)=(0, 0, 0) with ÷ q

one can get

B. Closed loop dynamics linearization of the proposed con-
troller
Without loss of generality we take R
d
= I, which mean
that ø p=ø q = q and b
d
i
= r
i
.The closed loop dynamic (12)
can be written around ½
1
=(?, q, ?)=(0

The pole-zero plots can be used to provide qualitative
insights into the response characteristics of system (24)
function of control gains. Since we have a nine degree
system, control gain tuning will be based on the dominant
poles. To choose a given gain, we begin by maintaining the
other Þxed and plot the location of the poles. The value of
the gain will be chosen to have a desired damping ratio and
a desired rise time for the dominant pole. For this, one can
use any computer program to plot pole-zero map by varying
one control gain at a time.
Also, observing equation (21) and (23) one can conclude
that the introduction of the gain ? in the case of the
proposed controller provides more ßexibility for gains tuning.
Specially, when determining the dominant pole, which is the
closest to the imaginary axis.
VI. SIMULATION RESULTS
To show the effectiveness of the proposed solution, we
present some simulation results and a comparison between
the proposed controller and the previous one. Let us denote
a state vector ?

cases depending essentially on the initial conditions of the
quaternion Q(0),

and

. Figure 2 and 4 show the
quaternion trajectories convergence in the two cases. Due to
space limitation, the evolution of the other elements of the
state vectors and the control input signals are omitted.
Analyzing these results, two main observations are ver-
iÞed. First, the unwinding phenomenon is avoided for the
two controllers. Second, the performance of the proposed
controller is better than the previous controller in terms
of speed of convergence. Figure 3 illustrates the difference
between previous control input signals and those of the
proposed controller.

The two controllers have the same behavior in this case,
trajectories converge to unstable equilibria. Figures 5-(A

proposed controller. Figures 5-(B

the inertial measurement errors for the previous controller.
Theses results show the main difference between the auxiliary
systems of the proposed and previous controllers. It is clear
that the proposed controller ensures the convergence of the
auxiliary vectors to the real ones globally.
VII. CONCLUSIONS
For the attitude control, the unavailability of the angular
velocity can be an interesting scenario. In fact, velocity-free
attitude control schemes could be of great help (as main or

backup controllers) in applications where prone-to-failure and
expensive gyroscope are used. In this paper, we have shown
that it is possible to stabilize the attitude of a rigid body
without any information about neither the angular velocity,
nor the attitude. Despite the considerable number of solutions
to this problem, almost all of them use the instantaneous
attitude measurements. The proposed controller needs only
two non collinear inertial measurement vectors to achieve an
almost global asymptotic stabilization.
This paper can be viewed as an extension version of a
previous controller. The main difference between the pro-
posed controller and previous controller is the deÞnition
of the auxiliary system used to compensate for the lack
of the angular velocity. We show that the choice of the
auxiliary system have a direct impact not only on the general
performance, but also on the number of unstable equilibria
of the closed loop dynamics of the rigid body system deÞned
in its state space. Also, an analysis of the effect of the
control gains on the closed-loop dynamics was presented for
the previous and current works. This analysis allowed us to
properly adjust the gains based on the position of the poles
and zeros of the linearized system.
A natural future work will be the real-time implementation
of this controller on a physical system.
