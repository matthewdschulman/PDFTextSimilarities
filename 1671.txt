Task-Space Position Control of Concentric-Tube Robot with Inaccurate
Kinematics Using Approximate Jacobian
Mohamed Nassim Boushaki, Chao Liu and Philippe Poignet
AbstractÑ Many medical applications can beneÞt from the
new technology of concentric-tube robot (CTR) due to its minia-
ture size, superior steerability, and controllability of the end
tool. However, the kinematic modeling of CTR is challenging
because of complicated physical phenomena caused by the
elasticity interaction between tubes. Existing control methods of
CTR are based on inverse kinematics calculation and hence the
control performance largely relies on the accuracy of kinematics
model used. In this work, we propose a new control method
from the actuator level and show that the control design of
actuator input in task-space with approximate Jacobian matrix
provides more ßexibility and robustness in handling inaccuracy
in kinematics model. It is shown through simulation study
that the proposed control method presents better performance
compared with traditional inverse kinematics based control
method in face of kinematics inaccuracy.
I. INTRODUCTION
The past few decades witness the evolution of surgical
intervention from traditional open surgery towards Mini-
mally Invasive Surgery (MIS), Single-Incision Laparoscopic
Surgery (SILS) and Natural OriÞce Translumenal Endo-
scopic Surgery (NOTES) due to their many advantages for
the patient, such as less trauma and post-operative com-
plications, reduced blood-loss and recovery time. On the
other hand, this evolution makes the surgical procedures
more challenging for the surgeon in terms of navigation to
reach the clinical target and manipulation once the target
is reached. To better assist surgeons in these surgical pro-
cedures, it is expected that new robotized surgical devices
should be more ßexible and more dexterous which allows
safe navigation through sensitive anatomic obstacles inside
the patientÕs body, and the device should keep sufÞcient
manipulability and dexterity after reaching the surgical site.
The concentric-tube robot (CTR) is a new technology
developed recently as a subset of continuum robots [1] [2].
Instruments used in MIS can be generally classiÞed into three
groups: straight ßexible needles; straight and stiff shaft with
articulated tool mounted at the tip; elongated and steerable
devices (multistage microrobot, steerable catheters, etc) [3].
Compared to the aforementioned instruments, concentric-
tube robot presents better tradeoff between steerability and
controllability on the tip. CTR is miniature robot with small
diameter and high dexterity which is composed of nested pre-
curved Nitinol tubes actuated independently and hence its
shape can be adapted to avoid anatomical obstacles and fol-
low complex 3D paths. With cross sections comparable with

needles and catheters, CTR is capable of both lateral motion
and axial force exertion. All these characteristics make it
suitable for minimally invasive and natural oriÞce surgery es-
pecially inside small body cavities [4]. Recent research works
have shown the potential of using CTRs in different med-
ical applications such as neurosurgery (endoscopic choroid
ablation) [5], intracardiac surgery [4], endonasal skull base
surgery [6] and lung biopsy surgery [7]. To realize real time
control of the CTR, mechanics-based models with different
assumptions have been developed to model the kinematics
of CTR. The Þrst model proposed assumes that the outer
most tube has inÞnity stiffness compared to inner tubes
[8]. Later on, more realistic physical phenomena previously
neglected, such as bending and torsion, have been taken into
consideration in order to improve the kinematics [9]. Based
on the developed kinematics models, several motion planning
algorithms have been developed [10] [11]. These motion
planning algorithms resort to inverse kinematics calculation
to obtain the actuator joint angles to achieve desired task
space positions. However, the inverse kinematics calculation
of CTR is not straightforward due to the nonlinear mapping
between relative tube displacements and tip conÞguration as
well as due to the multiplicity of solutions. A geometric
approach is given for single and multiple sections in [12] by
applying an analytical process to solve inverse kinematics
based on modelling of each section with a spherical joint
and a straight rigid link. Jacobian-based methods represent
another approach to robot-independent inverse kinematics. In
the Jacobian-based inverse kinematics strategy, it is possible
to build actuator limits into the control law so that the robotÕs
trajectory is always physically realizable [9], e.g. [13] for
active cannula results.
It is noticed that existing works in literature on CTR
position control are based on inverse kinematics calculation
to get the necessary actuator joint angle in order to achieve
control tasks that are usually deÞned in operational space
(image space, Cartesian space, etc). Consequently, the con-

trol performances are sensitive to the kinematic modelling
inaccuracy. However, so far there exists no closed form
kinematic of CTR when the number of tubes exceeds two,
and the modelling challenge lies in the physical phenomena
due to elasticity interaction between tubes such as bending,
friction and torsion. With the existence of kinematics mod-
elling errors, the inverse kinematics based control methods
may suffer position errors and lead to safety problems.
Although in teleoperation scenario this kind of positioning
deviation could be partially compensated by the surgeon, it
is not always guaranteed to work as the surgeonÕs intuitive
manual correction command could be mis-interpreted by
the inaccurate kinematics used in the inverse kinematics
calculation.
To alleviate this problem, in this study we investigate the
CTR position control from the actuator input level and it
is shown that even if only approximate Jacobian matrix is
available the position control task can be still accomplished
with a simple PID form control torque input based on task
space feedback position errors. The proposed control design
is rigorously analysed through theoretical proof. This work
presents a new method from the task-space control point of
view which has not been explored for CTR motion control.
Simulation studies based on a realistic experimental platform
are shown to justify the advantage of proposed task-space
control method over inverse kinematics based design method
in handling kinematics modeling inaccuracy.
II. KINEMATIC MODELS OF CTR
Since the concept of CTR was proposed in 2006 [1] [2],
many research efforts have been made to study its kinematics
model [14]. In this section the main existing kinematic
models of CTR are introduced.
(1) The Þrst idea was to consider the stiffness of the
outer-most tube of the robot inÞnite compared to all the
others inner tubes [8]. The limitation of this model is that
if the stiffness of the outermost tube is not high enough to
satisfy the assumption then the accuracy of the model will
be degraded, otherwise the shape variation will be limited
with less dexterity.
(2) Torsion-Free Model (TFM) takes into account the
bending interaction between tubes, but the torsion is ne-
glected. As the tubes are made of Nitinol, this assumption
has an impact on the rotation angles of the tubes and in some
cases the difference between the proximal and distal tubes
angles can be signiÞcant which effects the estimation of the
shape [1].
(3) Kinematics modeling of CTR is improved by including
the transmissional torsion between actuators and the Þrst
curved link in the Transmissional Torsion Model (TTM)
which reduces the error caused by torsion phenomenon in
the straight part, but the torsion in the curved part of the
tubes is neglected [15] [16].
(4) The most accurate model so far is based on Cosserat
Rod Theory (Special Cosserat Rod Equilibrium Model). The
torsion of the straight and curved parts of the tubes is
included in the model, but the latter is described by a second
order nonlinear differential equation causing problems of
boundary conditions and computational cost in real-time.
Another limitation is that the frictions are not included in
the model [17].
The inverse kinematic model of CTR is more complicated
compared to the other continuum robots. Analytically itÕs
divided into two mappings: from the cartesian space to the
arc parameters and then to the joint variables [9] [13]. The
closed form solution exists only for the two tube case.
Another way to solve the inverse kinematics problem is
to use numerical root Þnding function since the forward
kinematic model is nonlinear [18]. Inverse kinematic model
can also be obtained using the Jacobian matrix [9].
In summary, there exists no kinematics model that de-
scribes precisely the effects of all important physical phe-
nomena, and consequently existing inverse kinematics mod-
els used in motion control methods of CTR may lead to
positioning errors in practice. Moreover, inverse kinematics
calculation could be cumbersome due to the complicated and
nonlinear mapping.
III. FORMULATION OF CTR POSITION CONTROL TASK
AT ACTUATOR LEVEL
In literature, the position control of concentric tube robot
is mostly formulated as a motion planning problem based on
inverse kinematics calculation. Given the desired position or
trajectory x
d
in operational space, the corresponding desired
joint positions or trajectories q
d
are calculated by solving the
inverse kinematics:
q
d
= f
InvKin
(x
d
); (1)
and it is assumed that the actuator for each joint will
faithfully generate the desired joint motion q
d
. However, if
the robot kinematics is not accurately modelled the joint
position obtained through calculation (1) may not achieve
the desired operational space position.
In this work, we try to compensate the kinematics mod-
elling error from the actuator control input level and bypass
the inverse kinematics calculation, inspired by the works on
uncertain kinematics task-space control for serial robot in
literature [19] [20].
For existing CTR design, the joints are normally actuated
by current driven motors which possess the following dy-
namics:
M

where q denotes the motor rotor shaft angle, M

i
denotes the friction coefÞcient and
K
i
the torque constant.u
i
is the control current input,t
ei
is the
external load torque. r
i
=q
i
=q
i
is the transmission gear ratio
from the motor angleq to the CTR joint variablesq, which is
usually quite big and thus the effect of external loadt
ei
could
be neglected. Considering the linear relationship between
actuator and joint variables q
i
=r
i
q
i
and, for simplicity of
expression and without loss of generality, setting
K
i
r
i
= 1,
5878
the dynamic relationship between CTR joint variables and
actuator input can be written from (2) as:
M ¬ q+C ú q=u (3)
where M = diag([M
1
;;M
n
]), C = diag([C
1
;;C
n
]) and
u=diag([u
1
;;u
n
]).
Now the position control task could be speciÞed at the
actuator level: design the actuator current input u such that
the tip position x of CTR can reach the desired opera-
tional space position (Dx=x x
d
= 0) even with inaccurate
kinematics model. Compared to joint level control which is
directly inßuenced by the kinematics errors, the lower level
control design provides another solution which possesses
more ßexibility to handle such kind of problem.
IV. TASK-SPACE POSITION CONTROL OF CTR WITH
INACCURATE KINEMATICS
The operational space velocity ú x and the CTR joint veloc-
ity ú q could be determined by Jacobian matrix J(q) as [9]
ú x=J(q) ú q: (4)
With the presence of kinematics errors, accurate Jacobian
matrix is unknown and only estimated (best-guess) Jacobian
ö
J(q) is available.
In this study, it is assumed that the Jacobian estimation
errork
ö
J(q) J(q)k is bounded with an upper limit b as

J(q) J(q)kb: (5)
Based on the approximate Jacobian matrix

current input can be designed with the use of task-space
position error as in the following form:

ItÕs seen from the proposed control input (6) or (7) that
no inverse Jacobian calculation is required in this control
method which is in general much more complicated than
transpose Jacobian calculation. The task-space position error
can be obtained online through camera, ultrasound, MRI, etc
according to different clinical applications.
Next, we investigate the system performance through
Lyapunov analysis. Substituting control input (6) into the

Remark 1: From conditions (18) and (19), it can be seen
that the proposed method can handle kinematics error but
with certain range. When the kinematics estimation error is
too big, meaning b is big, the two conditions may no longer
be satisÞed and the system performance is not guaranteed,
which is logical that automatic controller cannot handle
inÞnite large modeling errors without online updation or
adaptation that lead to more complicated control design. On
the other hand, it should be noted that the Lyapunov analysis
is very conservative and so are the conditions deduced
meaning that in many cases even if conditions (18) and (19)
are not satisÞed the control task could be still achieved.
Remark 2: Although the proposed actuator current control
input also possesses a PID form, it is totally different from
the PID control of the actuator which is used to generate
the calculated joint position as in inverse kinematics based
methods. The difference lies in that the proposed PID actua-
tor controller takes no desired actuator joint position through
inverse kinematics as reference but the direct operational
space positioning error as feedback signal, and this makes
the difference between joint-space controller and task-space
controller.
V. SIMULATION STUDIES
Simulation studies have been carried out based on the
mechanical design of our recently developed prototype of
concentric-tube robot as shown in Fig. 2. The prototype is
composed of three pre-curved Nitinol tubes with each driven
by two motors for 2 DOFs (rotation and translation). As
the prototype is not yet fully functional, simulation study
is carried out instead to evaluate the performance of the
proposed control method in this paper. In this simulation
study, we investigate the position control task with the Þrst
two tubes. The workspace of the two-tube CTR is shown
in Fig.3. As accurate model for the CTR kinematics is not
available in practice so far, in the simulation we use the
Transmissional Torsion Model (TTM) as the true kinemat-
ics model for forward kinematics calculation. In order to
simulate the case of inaccurate modeling, the simpler and
less accurate Torsion-Free Model (TFM) is assumed to be
the model that is known to the designer and used to carry
out the inverse kinematics based control. And also, based
on TFM the Jacobian matrix is calculated which represents
the inaccurate Jacobian used in the proposed actuator current
input design. Here the more accurate but more complicated
Fig. 2: CTR Prototype: (top) Zoomed in picture of the
concentric tubes (bottom) Whole system with actuators
Fig. 3: workspace
Special Cosserat Rod Equilibrium Model (SCREM) is not
used as the true kinematics model since the purpose of
this simulation study is to investigate the capability of the
proposed control method in handling kinematics inaccuracy,
in this sense the choice of true model doesnÕt make real
difference as both are simpliÞed approximations of the
reality.
For the position control task, we deÞne 40 points in
cannula base frame (as seen in Fig. 2) along a circular
trajectory of 10 mm radius which is within the workspace
and deÞned by:
x

d

A position sensor is assumed to be available to provide online
update of task-space positioning errors.
Two simulation studies are provided here to compare the
performances of the traditional inverse kinematics based
control method and our proposed one in face of different
kinematics uncertainties. For inverse kinematics based con-
trol method, the desired joint variables for the Þrst speciÞed
point on the deÞned trajectory as by (20) are calculated
through inverse kinematics based on the less accurate model
5880
TFM, and the corresponding actual task-space positions are
calculated through the TTM forward kinematics which is
considered as the true model, and then task-space positioning
errors are fedback to update the joint variables through TFM
inverse kinematics in order to reach next speciÞed point. One
situation with smaller kinematics modeling inaccuracy and
one with bigger kinematics inaccuracy are considered. The
performances of this control method are illustrated in Fig. 4
for these two cases with different kinematic uncertainties.
(a) Smaller Modeling Inaccuracy
(b) Bigger Modeling Inaccuracy
Fig. 4: Inverse Kinematics Based Control
By using the control algorithm proposed as (6), the control
performances of the task-space approximate Jacobian po-
sition control method with the same kinematic uncertainty
settings as for inverse kinematics based control method are
illustrated in Fig. 5. The actuator dynamics parameters used
are the same as calibrated from the real prototype.
To have a quantitative evaluation of the control perfor-
mances, the means of L
1
norm of the position errors for
two simulation studies are provided in Table I for the
inverse kinematics based method (IK) and proposed task-
space control method (TC).
From Fig. 4, Fig. 5 and Table I, it can be concluded
that with the presence of kinematics modeling error the
task-space approximate Jacobian control method provides

better positioning performance over inverse kinematics based

Fig. 6 shows the CTR shape evolution (only 6 shapes
chosen) along the circular trajectory for one simulation study
of the proposed control method. The shapes are numbered
following the time sequence.
Discussions: (1) Although in this simulation study the
inverse kinematics based control performance using TFM
model is shown for comparison, it doesnÕt mean that we
are comparing the proposed method to this speciÞc model.
In fact, through the simulation study we want to show the
fact that with the existence of kinematics modeling error,
which is the case for all existing kinematics models, the
proposed method can provide automatic compensation at the
actuation level to achieve the control task. As mentioned
5881
Fig. 6: CTR Shape During Control
in the introduction, although with manual compensation of
the surgeon existing models may be enough for current
teleoperated control task, it is still desirable if this manual
compensation work could be left to the lower level motion
controller such that the surgeon can operate in more intuitive
way. To achieve that, the control design should provide the
robotic instrument capabilities to tolerate uncertainties and
disturbances within certain extent.
(2) The proposed control method relies on Jacobian matrix
of the concentric-tube robot. It is noticed that for most
existing kinematics models the Jacobian matrix, i.e. the
mapping from the operational space velocity to joint velocity,
can be obtained. For very complicated models (existing
or to come), an optimized approximation could be used
for the Jacobian matrix. In any case, as shown in this
work, the proposed control method may work with only
an approximated Jacobian without need of exact kinematic
information.
VI. CONCLUSIONS
Existing motion control methods for concentric-tube robot
are mainly based on inverse kinematics calculation which is
prone to inaccuracy in kinematics modeling. Through this
work, we show that this problem can be tackled by using
the approximate Jacobian matrix and direct measurement of
operational space error in the actuator control input design.
The positioning errors are guaranteed to converge asymptot-
ically through rigorous Lyapunov analysis given the control
parameters are properly chosen to satisfy certain conditions.
This result presents a new task-space control method that
has not been explored for concentric-tube robot motion
control. It is veriÞed through simulation study that the control
performance of the proposed method with the presence of
kinematics inaccuracy is better than inverse kinematics based
method. Experimental evaluation is currently in progress.
