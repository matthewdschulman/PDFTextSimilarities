impedance measurement at human hand, with professional and 
novice manual welders when they are performing Tungsten 
Inert Gas (TIG) welding interactively with the KUKA Light 
Weight Robot Arm (LWR). The welding torch is attached to 
the KUKA LWR, which is admittance controlled via a force 
sensor to give the feeling of a free floating mass at its end-
effector. The subjects perform TIG welding on 1.5 mm thick 
stainless steel plates by manipulating the torch attached to the 
robot. The end-point impedance values are measured by 
introducing external force disturbances and by fitting a mass-
damper-spring model to human hand reactions. Results show 
that, for professionals and novices, the mass, damping and 
stiffness values in the direction perpendicular to the welding 
line are the largest compared to the other two directions. The 
novices demonstrate less resistance to disturbances in this 
direction. Two of the professionals present larger stiffness and 
one of them presents larger damping. This study supports the 
hypothesis that impedance measurements could be used as a 
partial indicator, if not direct, of skill level to differentiate 
across different levels of manual welding performances. This 
work contributes towards identifying tacit knowledge of 
manual welding skills by means of impedance measurements.    
I. INTRODUCTION 
N this paper we perform end-point impedance 
measurements at human hand during a realistic 
manipulation task, manual welding, which is an 
indispensable process in many branches of industry [1]. 
Despite its importance, the skill that is required to perform 
good welding is tacit. A manual welding course lasts 20 to 
40 weeks and around 85% of the time is devoted to welding 
practices [2]. The tacit skills are learned implicitly first in 
such practice hours and then throughout the initial years of 
professional work [3]. The impedance measurement 
techniques developed in domains such as human physiology, 
physiological rehabilitation, and human-robot interaction [8-
15] might be applied for quantifying the tacit skills of 
welding. This study is a first attempt to perform impedance 
measurements with professional and novice welders. 
A first approach to quantifying differences in kinematic 
pattern of motion across skilled and unskilled welders was

presented in [4]. It was shown that skilled welders were 
more stable with the motion of the welding torch. Our 
previous work [5, 6] made a first step towards classifying 
between skilled and unskilled welding performances based 
on the variation of high frequency components of position 
signals. Afterwards, the findings inspired us to develop a 
robotic assistance for manual welding where damping was 
used to suppress vibrations [7]. In these works, the 
interaction forces between the human hand and the torch 
were not studied; therefore we did not have any idea about 
how the welders reacted to the vibrations during welding. 
This knowledge might be useful to develop more 
sophisticated and adaptive robotic assistance for manual 
welding. The present study focuses on this force interaction 
by analyzing how human hand reacts to disturbances. 
Human arm joint impedance or human end-point hand 
impedance can be measured by introducing either position 
[8, 9, 10, 11] or force [12, 13, 14, 15] disturbances. In this 
work we follow the force disturbance approach; because it is 
conveniently applied for manual welding, where the welding 
line is not pre-programmed and it might even dynamically 
change according to the working style of the welder.  
Impedance is usually measured when the human performs 
either position control, e.g. holding a handle at a reference 
position [10, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18], or trajectory control, while 
the hand is moving a handle from one point to another [8, 9, 
12]. In the latter case, a reference trajectory is used either for 
calculation of a reference position [8, 9] or for guiding the 
movement with a visual interface [12]. In [9], the authors 
apply artificial force fields and observe the impact of 
learning on arm impedance. Through learning, the subjects 
increase their end-point stiffness in order to counter the 
divergent force field. In [15], the authors measure the end-
point impedance while the subjects apply different grasp 
force on an object while positioning it at a given location.  
In the above studies the tasks are constructed for the 
purpose of the experiment and do not relate directly to a 
real-world application. Manual welding differs from those as 
it requires intense concentration and fine positioning under 
the conditions of the metal melting at high temperatures, 
noise arising from the welding equipment, a helmet allowing 
to see only the welding region, and the necessity to 
continuously monitor the process to achieve a good 
performance. For the experiments of this study, the novice 
subjects were briefly instructed about the process of 
welding, such as the melting conditions and how the melted 
part should look like for a good weld. A demonstration of 
welding was also performed to show these in practice. The

subjects were instructed to aim at a good quality weld along 
the line that connects the two pieces of metal plate. They 
were left free to move their body as they felt most 
comfortable, and to adapt the speed and position of the tool 
as they felt best to achieve a good performance.  
There are a handful of studies that perform impedance 
measurements in real-world tasks. In [19] the authors work 
on calligraphy drawing. They perform real time estimation 
of end-point arm stiffness based on the differential force and 
position values, for the purpose of adapting the damping of a 
collaborating robot. In [20], the end-point arm impedance is 
measured during virtual tennis playing. The authors state 
that the subjects prepare for the motion of hitting the ball by 
increasing hand stiffness. Although these studies make 
impedance estimation/measurement with real-world tasks, 
they do not provide comparative measurements across 
different types of performances. In the present study we 
perform measurements across professional and novice 
welders and compare the results. 
II. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP AND SUBJECTS 
The interactive manual welding system, shown in Fig. 1(a, 
b), is composed of the KUKA LWR robot, an ATI force 
sensor attached to its end-effector, and a standard TIG 
Welding setup. The welding torch is attached to the force 
sensor via an intermediary structure (interface). The subject 
manipulates the welding torch to weld the two stainless steel 
plates on the iron table along their touching edges. 
The KUKA LWR is a 7 degrees-of-freedom light-weight 
robot (16kg) designed for physical human-robot interaction. 
The robot is controlled through a dedicated Robot Controller 
Box and a Fast Research Interface (FRI). In this study the 
robot is admittance controlled using the force sensor (Fig. 
1(c)). The sensor monitors the forces applied by the human 
hand; the position is updated according to these forces.  
The admittance controller emulates a virtual free floating 
object at the end-efffector (Fig. 1(c)). Under nominal 
conditions (with no artificial force, f
a
=0), the force sensor 
reading is used to manipulate the position of the end-
effector. A virtual mass (m
v
) of 2kg is used to transfer the 
force signal into a velocity command to the position 
(velocity) controller. The Robot Controller Box, indicated as 
KUKA Position Controller in Fig. 1(c), provides 3 kHz 
servo-control cycle rate locally in the joints. The FRI 
provides 1 kHz overall servo-control cycle rate, for 
communication of the desired velocity (v
d
) between the 
controlling computer and the control box. The force signal is 
also sampled at 1kHz. In the absence of any artificial force 
(f
a
=0), the human feels like manipulating the virtual mass in 
free space, without any gravity impact. The velocity 
command to the position controller is generated according to 
the virtual mass dynamics taking into account the force 
applied by the human (f
s
) and compensating for the inertial 
force (f
t
) on the tool (torch), the mass of which is 0.3 kg. 
The TIG Welding setup is a standard one daily used in 
mechanical workshops. In the experiments the subjects 
performed straight line welding on 1.5 mm thick stainless 
steel plates (Fig.1 (a)) with 40 Amperes DC current. Manual 
welding necessitates wearing a helmet with special eye 
protection and leather gloves to protect the skin from the 
ultraviolet radiation in the vicinity of the welding arc (Fig. 
1(b)). The TIG welding in our experiments was without any 
external feed, meaning there were no sparks and molten 
metal particles spreading around. 
In these experiments the subjects performed welding with 
the robot in four different phases. In phase-I the subjects 
familiarized with the robot and the welding process. In this 
phase they performed welding freely on the metal plate and 
experienced for the instructed proper melting of metal to 
achieve a good weld. This phase lasted as long as the 
subjects got used to the system and felt confident with 
welding. In phase-II, the subjects performed normal 
interactive welding, without any disturbance.  
In phase-III the subjects performed welding with 
disturbances. They were informed that there would be 
disturbances. The disturbances composed of 100 ms duration 
3 N force impulses, randomly applied in one of the five (±x, 
±y, +z) directions. The impulses were introduced at random 
instances, making sure that there was at least 10 seconds 
duration between two successive impulses. The welding 
session in phase-III lasted around 110-120 seconds. Phase-
IV was a repetition of phase-III. Together in phase-III and 
phase-IV, we gathered data from 12 disturbances for each 
subject, four for each of the x, y, and z directions.  
The force data used for our measurements was passed 
through a low-pass filter with 20 Hz cutoff frequency (third 
order Butterworth filter) in order to eliminate sensor noise. 
This cutoff value was considered to be large enough to

capture the human force reactions as it is above the 
bandwidth that is required for meaningful human force 
perception (15 Hz is noted to be enough) [21], and as the 
same or lower values were used in some other studies [11, 
10, 17, 22]. The velocity and acceleration signals were 
generated from the position signals by numerical derivation 
using backward difference, and low pass filtering with 10 Hz 
cutoff frequency. The spectrum of the position signals 
included no significant power above 10 Hz.    
In this study we are interested in the average end-point 
hand impedance applied throughout the welding line. 
Therefore, we do not perform measurements at specific 
locations or with specific arm configurations, as it is done in 
other studies [28, 29, 12, 23]. In these works, the body of the 
subject is usually restrained by straps in a chair and the 
forearm of the subject is placed in a molded plastic cuff [29]. 
Therefore, a specific location in the workspace corresponds 
to a specific arm configuration. In our case, it is not 
desirable to limit the movement of the subject, because we 
are interested in the best performance of each subject for 
welding. The subjects were instructed “to do their best for a 
good welding”, which means they were free to choose the 
arm and body configurations. Our question was “what is the 
resulting average impedance on the welding line”. 
Therefore, in our experiments we applied disturbances at 
random locations on the welding line.  
Five professional and six novice welders took part in our 
experiments. However, two of the professionals did not 
adapt to the robotic system. One of them demonstrated too 
much position variation and the other demonstrated abrupt 
movements after disturbances. Therefore we present the 
results of the other three professionals and the six novices. 
The novice subjects were recruited among the PhD and post-
doc researchers in our research group. These novice subjects 
did not have any prior experience in welding, except for 
experiencing it once or twice during their practical courses 
in their bachelors. The professional welders were recruited 
from the mechanical workshops of EPFL. They had either 
prior or current TIG welding experience as a part of their 
daily job. Besides the skills and experience in welding, the 
remarkable difference between the professional and novice 
subjects was that the former had larger and more muscled 
arms due to their daily manual work.  
III. PERFORMANCE MEASURE 
Interactive welding with the KUKA LWR differs from 
normal manual welding that professional welders are used 
to. Professional welders usually stabilize their welding arm 
by placing it on the table. This is not possible with the 
interactive welding because of the limited closed loop 
bandwidth of the robot. If the arm holding the torch touches 
the table, the interaction with the robot resembles a hard 
contact and causes the robot to shake at the end effectors. 
This difference was the main cause that two of the 
professional welders did not adapt to the interactive system. 
For the other three professionals and the novices, it was 
possible to adapt by exercising during the phase-I of the 
experiments. Since we are comparing novice welders with 
the professionals, we may hence wonder whether the three 
professional welders still realized their skills and performed 
better than the novices during interactive welding. 
In our previous work [5] we demonstrated that kinematic 
variation of the tip of the torch can be used as a performance 
criterion to distinguish across skilled and unskilled welders 
for normal welding (without the robot). In the present study 
we use the same performance criterion to see whether the 
three professional subjects still perform better than the 
novice subjects when performing welding with the robot in 
phase-I. If we observe less variance with the professional 
welders, as it is the case with normal welding without a 
robot, then we can conclude that the professionals 
demonstrate skillful welding also with the interactive 
welding with robot. We pass the position signals through a 
high pass filter with 0.5 Hz cutoff frequency to eliminate the 
slow variations, such as the linear increase of position along 
the direction of the welding line (y) (Fig. 3(b)). Afterwards, 
first we calculate the variance of the three components of the 
position signal and then we calculate the variation of the 
magnitude of the position as in (1-3), where 

The phase-II experiments do not include any disturbance; 
therefore we can use a continuous duration of 80 seconds 
(between 20-100 seconds) for variance and variation 
calculations. The results are given in Table I for each 
subject. The novices demonstrate in average more variance 
in all three components. We observe that the average 
variation is smaller for the professionals than for the 
novices. There is only one novice, N2, who demonstrates 
slightly less variation than two of the professionals. All the 
other novices demonstrate more variation than all 
professionals. This is an indicator that in average the three 
professionals perform better than the novices with the 
interactive system. We also observe that both professionals 
and novices demonstrate minimum variance in x direction, 
middle range in y direction and maximum in z direction.  
In Fig. 2 we present the photos of interactively welded 
metal plates in phase-II experiments by the professional 
subject P1 (a) and the novice subject N4 (b). In these photos, 
the better quality of the weld by the professional subject is 
visible. The line of welding and the thickness of the weld of 
the professional are more regular. The weld of the novice 
subject makes a lot of zigzagging. These are indications of 
the better control of the movement in x direction (less 
variance) by the professional welder. The dark spots on the 
weld by the novice subject occur because of irregular and 
128
 
 
 
 
improper melting of the metal. This is an indication that the 
novice subject did not maintain a regular speed and height as 
the professional (more variance in y and z directions).  
With similar variation analysis, we demonstrated for the 
phase-III and -IV experiments that in the 5 seconds period 
before each disturbance, the variation of position was on the 
same level as those for the phase-I experiments (without  
disturbance). (This analysis is not presented here due to page 
limitations). This means that the 100 ms disturbance in our 
experiments was short enough for a fast recovery of the 
normal welding pace after the disturbance. Therefore the 
presence of disturbances in phase-III and -IV did not cause a 
significant difference in welding performance at the 
measurement instances. As a result, we can assume that the 
impedance values measured with disturbances in phase-III 
and -IV are representative of the welding performances 
without disturbances in phase-II.         
IV. CAPTURING AND MODELING THE IMPEDANCE 
Mechanical impedance describes the relation between an 
external force and the position of the system. We are 
interested in the end-point impedance, at the junction 
between the human hand and the welding torch. Therefore, 
the end-point human hand impedance in this paper refers to 
the overall Cartesian impedance generated together by the 
impacts of the shoulder, elbow, ankle joints, the soft tissue 
of the hand, and the leather glove worn by the subject. 
The impedance measurement is performed by introducing 
external forces that exceed the nominal force required for the 
task around one order of magnitude. The subject applies a 
low nominal force to manipulate the torch along the welding 
line. When there is an artificial force (f
a
) (acting in the time 
window [t
d
, t
e
]) (4), much larger than the nominal force, the 
robot acts basically under the control of the former and 
generates an abrupt motion. There is a short period of around 
100 ms [25] during which the human cannot react 
voluntarily to generate forces to counter the abrupt motion. 
In this paper, for our calculations we consider the period of 
200 ms ([t
d
, t
w
]), instead of 100 ms, and assume that any 
voluntarily action in this 200 ms period is negligible 
compared to the passive impedance reactions. The use of a 
larger period than 100 ms is because the variation of the 
collected data in 100 ms period is not enough to calculate 
physically meaningful (all positive) impedance values in a 
consistent way (more than 90% of the cases).  
Due to the abrupt position change generated by the 
disturbance, large forces occur in between the human hand 
and the torch, observed as the sensor force (f
s
). The external 
force applied on the human hand (f
e
) can be captured by 
simply subtracting the nominal force required for welding 
(sensor reading just before the disturbance, f
s
(t
d
)) from the 
sensor reading during the disturbance (5). Moreover, the 
position change due to disturbance (p
d
) can also be captured 
by subtracting the nominal position (position just before the 
disturbance, p
r
(t
d
)) from the position during the disturbance 
(6). In this work we measure the position of the human hand 
with the position reading of the robot for its end-effector 
(p
h
=p
r
); because the subject is constantly holding the torch 
throughout the experiment. The KUKA LWR has ±0.05 mm 
repeatability; therefore, we can assume that we have precise 
enough measurements for the purposes of this study.

In Fig. 3(a, b), the force and position signals are shown 
respectively for the whole period of one welding session 
with disturbance (~110 sec). In the force graph we can see 
the peaks due to the external artificial force. In Fig.3 (d, e) 
we zoom in the external force and position values in the 
vicinity of the first disturbance. The artificial force applied 
at this instant is shown in Fig. 3(c). We observe that within 
the window of 100 ms before the disturbance, the force 
remains less than 0.36 N. With the disturbance, in –x 
direction, the force level increases up to 3.4 N. Similarly 
while the position level before the disturbance remains less 
than 0.2 mm in –x direction, after the disturbance it rises up 
to 2 mm at 100 ms and more than 3.5 mm afterwards. This is 
an indication that the external force is much larger than the 
residual variations of the nominal force required for welding. 
Therefore, we can use this period after the disturbance to 
measure the passive dynamics of the holding hand. 
A. Measure of Resistance to Disturbance 
Impedance is a measure of resistance to disturbances. This 
resistance is mostly modeled as the mechanical response of a 
mass, damper, spring system. However, before modeling the 
reaction in these terms, it is possible to suggest an intuitive 
measure by looking at the amount of position deviation

when the overall artificial force is applied. In this subsection 
we simply measure the ratio of the value of the force (df) to 
the value of position (dp) at the end of the disturbance period 
(100 ms) (Fig.3 (d, e)). This ratio is named as the 
‘resistance’ and designated with r in (7) and in Table II.

In Table II, first we present the results of resistance 
measurements for all subjects, in x, y, and z directions. For 
both professionals and novices, the resistance in the x 
direction is the largest, followed by that in the y direction, 
and that in the z direction is the smallest. This observation 
resonates with the previous result that the variance of 
position in the x direction is the smallest, followed by that in 
the y direction, and that in the z direction is the largest 
(Table I). We observe that, for the direction x, the resistance 
for each professional is larger than that of all novices. We do 
not observe any significant difference for the resistance in y 
and z directions. In the rest of the paper, we investigate how 
these resistances can be distributed as impacts of mass, 
damping, and stiffness, according to our impedance model. 
B. Modeling the Impedance 
The impedance we want to measure describes the relation 
between the series of data collected for the external force 
(f
e
), and the disturbance position (p
d
). 
The impedance associated with whether the human arm 
joints or human hand end-point is generally modeled as a 
mass/inertia, damper, and spring system. Identifying the 
mass, damping, and stiffness parameters together in a 
consistent way is mostly performed by using long duration 
data, such as 300 ms [20], 370 ms [24], 30 sec [10, 13], and 
1 minute [15]. In our work we aim at estimating the 
impedance values using a time window of 200 ms. There are 
two reasons for the choice of such a shorter duration. 
The first reason is related to the voluntary reaction time of 
human to an external disturbance. The short-latency reflexes 
take place within the first 25-45 ms after the disturbance; the 
long-latency reflexes occur within the 45-100 ms period 
[25]. These are both involuntary movements that can be 
modeled as a passive dynamical system. After 100 ms, the 
subject produces voluntarily movements, which can no 
longer be modeled as a passive system [24]. Therefore the 
impedance measured in 100 ms might significantly differ 
from the one measured during a long period lasting several 
seconds. In our case, we used 200 ms instead of 100 ms, 
because this was the shortest possible duration that we could 
determine positive impedance parameters with a rate higher 
than 90% of the total number of measurements. We assume 
that for impedance measurement purposes, the impact of 
voluntary movements in between the 100 and 200 ms period 
are negligible compared to the passive impedance reaction. 
This assumption is partially supported by physiology studies 
of arm reaction with visual feedback. In [26], the average

EMG onset latency of the arm muscles are around 200 ms; 
in [27] the mean reaction time is determined to be 579 ms 
for a pulling action.  
The second reason for limiting the measurement window 
to 200 ms is that in a real world task like welding, the 
external disturbance should be as brief as possible in order to 
minimally disturb the performance. If we applied long 
duration disturbances, like for a few seconds, the subject 
would be totally distracted and would not be able to recover 
the normal pace of the performance in a short time. 
Moreover, the uncontrolled movement of the torch for such 
a long time would totally destroy the regularity of the 
welding: the melted part on the plate would cool down and it 
would be necessary to melt it again and again after each 
disturbance, as it requires at every start of welding.  
Our attempts to determine the impedance parameters with 
only the 100 ms long data failed. This was because the 
variation of the force/position data in the 100 ms duration 
was so limited that the parameter estimation problem 
happened to be indeterminate. Various inconsistent and 
some negative mass, damping, and stiffness values could fit 
to the force-position relation. The rate of success to find 
positive impedance values with our model (8) with 100 ms 
duration was only 18%. This rate increased to 80% with 180 
ms and finally to 98% with 200 ms duration. The impedance 
values changed with longer durations and after some time 
became mostly negative, indicating that voluntary reactions 
became dominant. With 1 sec long duration the rate of 
success to find positive impedance values was 52%.  
The end-point impedance parameters in three Cartesian 
directions are usually modeled to be coupled, in the form of 
mass, damping, and stiffness matrices, rather than 
parameters [12, 28, 29, 10, 11, 30]. In all these work, the 
movement is restricted to a horizontal plane; therefore the 
mass, damping, and stiffness matrices are two by two. The 
minimum disturbance period among those is 0.28 seconds 
[12]; the others range from 0.3 [29], to 0.45 [28], to 30 [10] 
seconds. In our case, the movement is in three dimensions. 
This means that if we modeled the impedance parameters in 
a coupled way we would have more than the double of the 
parameters in the mentioned studies, and therefore would 
need longer duration for estimation. Indeed, when we used 
the coupled model with duration of 1 sec, we found positive 
impedance values comparable to those in [28], with a rate of 
72%. However, this was a too long duration that voluntary 
reactions might have blurred the passive impedance 
characteristics. When we used the duration of 100 or 200 ms 
with the coupled model, the indeterminacy became so severe 
that we could hardly ever find positive impedance values 
(6% and 16% success rate for 100 and 200 ms, respectively).  
Perhaps, due to similar difficulties as we faced, coupling 
effects were ignored in some other studies [20, 15, 31, 16, 
18]. Following these, in this study, we model the end-point 
impedance as a mass, damper, spring system in each of the 
three main directions, decoupled from each other (8).

In (8), M, D, and K are the end-point mass, damping and

 is the mass of the welding torch (300 g). Given the 
force (

), acceleration (6 3

) 
data this equation can easily be solved for the mass, damping 
and stiffness values by least-squares method (using the 
pseudo-inverse of the matrix constituted by the acceleration, 
damping, and stiffness data samples). In our solutions, we 
used all the data samples collected at 1 kHz rate for each of 
the 200 ms duration measurements. In total we performed 
108 measurements; only 3 of them resulted in non realistic 
values (negative mass, stiffness, or damping), which we 
ignored in our results. This means that with 200 ms period 
the rate of failure in measurements was less than 3%. 
Fig.4 (a, b) show a sample measurement. The impedance 
values found are used to estimate the force and position 
signals. The position estimate is constructed by solving the 
second order differential equation in (8) for the position, 
using the given force data with the determined impedance 
parameters. The force estimate is constructed by direct 
calculation (8) with the given position, velocity, acceleration 
data and the impedance parameters. The estimated 
trajectories are shown in Fig. 4 with green (light) dashed 
lines. The measured mass, damping, stiffness values are 
indicated in the caption of the figure.   
V. RESULTS OF MEASUREMENTS WITH SUBJECTS 
In Table II we present the results of measurements for the 
average end-point impedance parameters for each of the 
three professional and six novice welders.  
The professional welders have larger mass values than the 
novices in the x direction, perpendicular to the welding line. 
This is not surprising, because, due to their daily manual 
work, the professional welders have more muscled and 
heavier arms. However, we do not observe larger mass 
values in y and z directions for the professional welders. This 
is an indication that the larger mass values of professional 
welders in x direction are not only due to the larger masses 
of their arms, but also due to that the professional welders 
orient their arms to apply larger resistance in this direction.  
The average damping values for the professionals and 
novices are close to each other in x and z directions. 
However, the damping values of the professionals in y 
direction are in general larger than those of the novices. 
Having larger damping along the welding line is perhaps 
influential to have more stable speed and hence more regular 
melting of the metal. 
Among the professionals we observe two different 
distributions of stiffness and damping in x direction. For P1 
and P2, we observe significantly large stiffness with an 
average of 768 N/m and moderate damping with an average 
of 44 Ns/m. For P3, we observe the lowest stiffness over all 
the subjects, 137 N/m, with the largest damping, 63 Ns/m. 
The mass value of P3 is also less than the mass value of the 
other two professionals. It is interesting to observe that 
although these three professionals demonstrate similar level 
131
 
 
 
 
of resistance in x direction, the distribution of this resistance 
takes two different forms: large mass and large stiffness with 
P1 and P2 and large damping with P3. In y and z directions 
we observe no significant difference in stiffness between the 
professionals and novices.    
The value of mass is configuration dependent, not 
controlled by voluntary action. The value of damping is 
most of the time assumed to be dependent on the muscle 
activation, but there is no indication that damping can 
consciously be controlled by the subject. In some studies, it 
is modeled to be proportional or non-linearly dependent on 
stiffness [32]. Stiffness, on the other hand is directly related 
to muscle activation. It is the only one that can consciously 
be manipulated, therefore it is most interesting from the 
point of view of understanding “what is to be done” in order 
to have a good performance. In this respect, the observation 
of large stiffness with two of the professionals, P1 and P2, is 
remarkable. The stiffness values in different studies vary due 
to differences in the methods and arm orientations required 
for the experimented task. In [9], the stiffness values change 
in the range 150-700 N/m, in [12] in the range 100-400 N/m 
along the principal axis, and in [20] in the range 75-264 
N/m. In [28] the coupled stiffness values range between 22-
448 N/m. In [15] the serially acting hand-tissue stiffness and 
arm stiffness change respectively in the range 428-868 and 
93-355 N/m. The stiffness values we found are comparable 
to these values. For two of the professionals, P1 and P3, the 
stiffness in the x direction is slightly larger than those found 
in these literatures. This is most probably because in our 
case, the task required larger resistance specifically in the x 
direction for better performance and these two professionals 
did it with increasing the stiffness. In [9], the stiffness along 
the perpendicular direction to the movement is shown to 
increase from an average value of around 300 N/m in 
nominal conditions to an average value of around 700 N/m 
under the condition of an opposing artificial force field. 
Therefore large values are not surprising under specific 
cases of tasks. Such larger values as we found for the two 
professionals (722, 815 N/m), for the x direction, might be 
effective to have better performance. Our mass and damping 
values as well compare to those in other studies [20, 28, 15].  
VI. CONCLUSION 
In this study we present hand impedance measurements of 
three professional and six novice welders while performing 
TIG welding interactively with the KUKA LWR robot. In 
contrast to many others, this study focuses on a real-world 
manipulation task which requires significant concentration 
and eye-hand coordination. In agreement with other studies, 
we found the largest impedance values in the longitudinal 
direction that the subject faced and that most influenced the 
quality of welding.  
Inspired from our previous work [5], we measured the 
quality of the performance by means of variation of the torch 
position. According to this measure we observed that the 
professionals in average perform better than the novices also 
with the interactive welding as they do with normal welding 
without robot. Our results show that in comparison to the 
novices, the three professionals demonstrate larger resistance 
in the perpendicular direction to the welding line. Two of the 
professionals generate the resistance by applying larger 
stiffness and one of them by applying larger damping.

This study should be considered as a first step to use 
impedance measurements towards identifying manual 
welding skills. Perhaps, impedance values are not direct 
indicators of manipulation skills. Perhaps for many other 
tasks, the ability to dynamically adapt the impedance is more 
relevant than having a specific level of impedance. 
However, for the case of welding, where the interaction does 
not change much and where the motion requires regularity, 
we see a tendency of lager impedance with the three 
professional subjects, in the form of either a larger stiffness 
or larger damping. This observation suggests that larger 
impedance might be a part of skilled welding or a factor that 
might increase the quality of performance. We should note 
that the present study does not provide enough evidence to 
generalize this observation to all professional welders; 
because the number of participants is not enough to provide 
statistical significance. However, it clearly shows that the 
three professionals in the study demonstrate 
characteristically different impedance levels than all the 
novice subjects and that their way of performance leads to 
better quality welding. We believe that this observation is 
important from assistive robotics point of view. The results 
suggest that a robot might be controlled to provide larger 
impedance in specific directions (perpendicular to the 
welding line) in order to assist novice welders. The same 
principle might apply to other real-world tasks, such as 
painting, which require regularity of the motion, rather than 
fast changing interaction forces.   Future work will focus on 
exploiting the results of this study for robotic assistance.
