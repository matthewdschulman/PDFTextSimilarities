 
Abstract— This paper presents the design, analysis and 
characterization of a compliant mechanism that saves power 
for flapping-wing micro-air vehicles (FWMAV).  The 
compliant mechanism is shaped after the insect’s flight thorax, 
which has integrated elastic hinges for energy storage. It shows 
a nonlinearly increasing stiffness, which slows the wings down 
rapidly toward the end of a wing stroke and reverses the wings 
quickly, just like the elastic radial stop in Dipteran insects.  
When used to drive a 10-cm wing span FWMAV, it saves 
power up to 31% in comparison to a conventional rigid-body 
flapping mechanism, which have no elastic storage capability. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
Flapping-wing flight is agile but could be energetically 
cost to hover. [1]
 
[2] Substantial power is expended to move 
air and wings [3]
 
[4]. Aerodynamic power is incurred to 
produce lift and overcome drag in air.  In addition, inertial 
power is needed to accelerate the wing from rest at the 
beginning of a stroke and then decelerate it to a rest at the 
end of the stroke
 
[1]
 
[4].  This inertial power increases 
greatly with frequency and can take up as much as 53% of 
the total flight power during hovering. [5] In comparison, 
less agile rotary wing flight by helicopter is energetically 
more efficient during hovering because it does not need to 
accelerate and decelerate the rotary wing blades [6].   
However, entomologists and aerodynamicists found that 
insects had a way to reduce the inertial power by elastic 
energy storage in their flight apparatus [2]
 
[7]
 
[8].  Insect has 
elastic elements in their flight muscles
 
[9], flight thorax, and 
wing hinges [2]
 
[3]. In Dipteran insects, each wing rotates 
about a fulcrum at the pleural process of their flight thorax 
when their muscles contract to deform the thorax. At the end 
of wing stroke, wing momentum is converted into elastic 
energy, in the deformed elastic elements.  The elastic energy 
is recovered during wing reversal in assistance to flight 
muscles
 
[3]
 
[10].  Hence, most power output by the insect 
flight muscles is expended on aerodynamic power, and little 
is needed for inertial power. 
In contrast, most flapping wing micro air vehicles 
(FWMAV) are not capable of storing elastic energy (DelFly
 
[6], Nano-Hummingbird
 
[11]). An electric motor itself that 
powered the MAV cannot store elastic energy.  Rigid body 
mechanisms for common FWMAV have no elastic element 
to recover the inertial power. Hence, most FWMAVs are 
limited to short flight endurance because wing reciprocation 
requires high inertial power in addition to aerodynamic 
power. 
Recently, some researchers have attempted elastic energy 
storage by including discrete springs in the motor-powered 
rigid-body mechanism for flapping wings.  Madangopal et al 
[12] showed by simulation that inclusion of linear coil 
springs, which connect wing roots to the ground of a crank-
rocker mechanism, can reduce the peak torque required from 
a motor as much as 12%, whereas Tantanawat and Kota [13] 
showed by simulation that it could reduce the peak input 
power as much as 42%.  Baek and Fearing
 
[14] showed by 
experiment that incorporation of a linear coil spring in a 
crank slider mechanism can save motor power as much as 
19% in the presence of friction in the revolute-joined 
mechanism. However, discrete springs increase payload of 
the FWMAV and do not help to reduce friction in the 
mechanism.   
However, compliant mechanism could be used to store 
elastic energy inherently and be free of friction. A thorax-
like compliant mechanism could be man-made using 
lightweight composites. Recently, Wood has developed 3cm 
span Robotfly using carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP) 
as the exoskeleton plates and polyimide film as the flexible 
hinges to build compliant thoracic mechanism, with elastic 
energy storage in the piezoelectric actuator [15].  However, 
it is not clear if the compliant thoracic mechanism could 
store enough elastic energy for a larger scale motorized 
FWMAV (10-15cm wing span, 3g and more) [16].  In 
Sahai’s attempt [17], thick elastomeric strips are used to 
store the required elastic energy instead of the polyimide 
hinges. Stiffer polyimide hinges can store more elastic 
energy, but they are susceptible to fatigue fracture due to 
high cyclic loading by large wing stroke. 
In this paper, we present a lightweight compliant thoracic 
mechanism with multiple-stiffness polyimide hinges that 
could store elastic energy required for FWMAV with a 
100mm wing span, larger than most insects’. The thoracic 
mechanism is a close-form shell consisting of rigid plates 
connected by flexible hinges. The hinges are made of 
different stiffness to have large wing stroke and high energy 
storage. Like insects, it produces wing flapping motion when 
its tergal plate is reciprocated. The tergal depression 
manifested a nonlinearly increasing stiffness, which slows 
the wings down rapidly at the end of a wing stroke and 
reverses the wings quickly, just like the elastic radial stop in 
Dipteran insects [18].  We further show that power saving is 
effective only if elastic energy storage is sufficient to 
recover the inertial power, below the resonant frequency of 
the thoracic mechanism.

II. THORACIC MECHANISM 
A. Insect-inspired Design 
Insects’ flight thorax, which on which the wings 
attached, has a sophisticated anatomy. However, it could be 
visualized as a ring of exoskeleton plates and hinges. The 
exoskeleton plates are made of tough chitin, while the wing 
hinges are composed of softer elastic resilin. The ring has 
the side (pleura) and the base (sternum) walls fused together, 
while the wings hinged on the pleura and the wing base is 
joined to the tergum.
 
[19] When its tergum plate is depressed 
by flight muscles, the thorax flaps the wings upwards. Upon 
muscles relaxation, the thorax restores to its unloaded shape 
and releases the stored elastic energy in assistance to 
muscles for reversing the wing stroke.    
Such thorax could be made using lightweight composite 
compliant mechanism. Like Wood’s Robotfly thorax, we use 
CFRP as rigid plates and polyimide films as hinges. 
However, the compliant thoracic mechanism is designed as a 
closed-form composite shell with a non-linear stiffness 
characteristic, which store up elastic energy at increasing 
rate when deformed further. Its symmetry half appears like 
four-bar linkages with elastic polyimide hinges (Fig. 1). It is 
activated by a motor through a crank-slider mechanism that 
reciprocates a tergal plate of the thorax.  Like the insect 
thorax, tergum depression bends the polyimide hinges of the 
wing base and produces an upward wing stroke (Fig. 2).   
 
Fig. 1 Compliant thoracic mechanism with integrated elastic energy 
storage in the polyimide hinges. 
 
Fig. 2 Activation of the compliant mechanism under a force at the 
tergum 
To meet the needs for a large wing stroke and enough 
elastic energy storage without risking fracture, multiple-
stiffness flexural hinges are used in the thoracic mechanism. 
There are three elastic hinges in a half thorax. The wing 
hinge is designed to have the least stiffness to allow large 
wing stroke.  The tergal hinge is made slightly stiffer to 
transfer the actuation force from tergum to the wing base but 
also bend for the wing rotation. The pleural hinge is stiffest 
because it bends only a little and so act as the main energy 
storage. This compliant mechanism exhibits a low stiffness 
when the wing is at the neutral stroke and moves at the 
highest speed. However, it shows an increasingly high 
stiffness at the end stroke, where the wing stops and 
reverses. To minimize undesired twisting of hinges, the 
hinge length is designed to be small compared to width. 
 
B. Analysis 
The amount of elastic energy storage is important for the 
thorax design. Yet, it changes nonlinearly with the hinge 
deformation and large rotations of the linkages. To simplify 
the analysis, a symmetric half of the thorax is modeled as a 
pseudo-rigid model, which consists of rigid linkages and 
joints with torsional spring (Fig. 3). In this pseudo model, 
the tergum plate is represented by the slider on the 
symmetric half. Meanwhile, wing base and pleural process 
are represented by two linkages of length D and L 
respectively. The polyimide hinge between the rigid plates is 
represented by a revolute joint and a torsional spring.  The 
equivalent linkage length is the sum of the plate length and 
half of the hinge lengths, at its two ends.  The pleural 
process linkage is connected to the pleural wall (ground) 
through a spring with rotational stiffness K
0
, and the wing 
base through a spring with rotational stiffness K
1
.  The wing 
base linkage connects to the pleural process through a spring 
with rotational stiffness K
1
 and tergum through a spring with 
rotational K
2
. 
 
Fig. 3 Pseudo-rigid model of the half thorax with the wing base in static 
equilibrium of its neutral state and activated state. 
When not loaded, the tergum is statically positioned at 
the neutral point h.  The unloaded wing attitude is angled 
slightly downward.  To create an upward wing stroke, the 
tergum is depressed by a force F and travels a displacement 
y from the initial height y
0
.  As a result of tergum depression, 
the wing lever of length D rotates by an angle ? (relative to 
the horizontal) whiles the pleural process of length L rotates 
by and angle ? (relative to the vertical). The tergum height 
off the pleural-process hinge is related to the plate rotations, 
following: 
? =? 0
+? ??? ? ?? ??? ? (1) 
To achieve a static wing stroke of 60°, typical to 
FWMAV, a crank length of 3mm is chosen to reciprocate 
the tergum with a total displacement of 6mm, up to down 
about the neutral point.  Distance between the anchors of 
pleural wall to the symmetry plane, over which the two 
linkages span, remains a constant W. This yields the 
following constraint equation: 
? =? ??? ? +? ??? ? (2) 
Depressive force on the tergum is resisted by the 
deformed torsional springs in the thoracic compliant 
mechanism.  It can be determined from force analysis of 
individual linkages. Moment equilibrium for the pleural 
process linkage of length L yields:

Table 1 summarizes current design parameters chosen to 
produce a static wing stroke of 60°given ?3mm of tergum 
reciprocation by a 6-mm diameter coreless DC motor. The 
stiffness is chosen to store elastic energy that matches the 
maximum wing kinetic energy at 30Hz, assuming same wing 
stroke. The design is not dynamically optimized because the 
dynamic response in terms of wing stroke is unknown.

When deformed, this thoracic mechanism produces a 
wing stroke, which increases in linear proportion to the 
tergum depression. Fig. 4 show the wing sweeps 10° per 1 
mm tergum depression. However, the force required to 
depress the tergum increases non-linearly with the tergum 
displacement as in Fig. 5.  The theoretical prediction agrees 
well in trend with the experimental measurements.

mechanism is equal to the work done by the depressive force

Experiment showed that this thoracic mechanism can 
stored up to 0.4937mJ (50.3 g-f.mm) when the tergum is 
displaced down by 4.20 mm to produce a 33.2° wing flap. In 
comparison, theoretical model overestimate the value to be 
2.492mJ (240g-f.mm) at 4.31mm tergum displacement.

C. Fabrication 
The compliant thorax is made of CFRP plates (HexPly 
M10R/38%/UD150/CHS) and polyimide film hinges 
(DuPont Kapton HN).  The thoracic shell is an assembly and 
fold-up of three pieces of integrated hinge on plates. Each 
piece of the integrated hinge on plates is prepared by 
reinforcing a blank strip of polyimide film with CFRP 
patches. Its fabrication is done by using vacuum bagging 
method that lays up and cures CFRP prepregs on a flat 
polyimide film. The reinforced patches form the CFRP 
plates with the cured thickness of 3.2mm, while the 
unreinforced spacing of the polyimide film forms the hinge. 
Assembly between the pieces is done by adhesive bonding. 
The flexural hinges are fabricated with different 
thickness and length to achieve the designed stiffness.  The 
tergal hinge is of 0.0508 mm thick (2mil).  The wing hinge 
that connects wing base to the wing process is a soft 
0.0254mm (1mil) thin polyimide film while the pleural 
hinge is stiffest using 0.127mm (5mil) thick polyimide film. 
The wing is made of 25?m thick polyester film of 
quarter-elliptical shape, with the leading edge length of 5cm 
and root chord of 3.1cm, at the aspect ratio of 4. The leading 
edge is reinforced with CFRP on both sides such that it is 
rigid span wise. The root chord is softer with single-side 
CFRP reinforcement to allow passive rotation about the 
leading edge.  
 
D. Benchmark Rigid Body Mechanism  
To illustrate the benefit of elastic storage, a compliant 
mechanism needs to be compared with a rigid-body 
counterpart. Unlike the rigid-body mechanism with discrete 
springs, a compliant mechanism does not have an identical 
rigid-body counterpart. Replacing elastic hinges from the 
compliant mechanism will yield an under-constraint 
mechanism that does not work. For comparison, the rigid-
body counterpart is chosen to be a pair of rigid wing levers 
(Fig. 6), pivoted at a fulcrum each, such that the wing base 
has the same length D as its compliant mechanism 
counterpart (Table 2).

This rigid body benchmark (Fig. 7) is equipped with the 
same wing and it beats an 80° wing stroke using a 5mm 
crank. With similar wing stroke and kinematics at 20-30Hz, 
the rigid-body counterpart is expected to produce the same 
aerodynamic and inertial work as the compliant mechanism. 
At the same basis of aerodynamic and inertial work output, 
energy input saving could be attributed to the effect of 
elastic energy storage in the mechanism.

III. ENERGETIC COSTS ANALYSIS 
A. Power Requirements of Flapping Flight 
Flapping flight of micro air vehicle demands a lot of 
power.  Firstly, aerodynamic power is expended in moving 
the wings against air.  Secondly, inertial power is also 
required to accelerate and decelerate the wings.  Thirdly, if 
there is embedded spring for elastic energy storage, elastic 
power is required to compress the spring though recovered 
upon the spring back. Lastly, friction in transmissions and 
motor causes dissipative loss.  To sum up, the total 
mechanical power (P
mech
), i.e. the cost incurred by flapping 
flight, is a sum of the aerodynamic power (P
aero
), inertial 
power (P
inertial
), elastic power (P
elastic
), and friction losses 
(P
losses
): 
? ??? ?
=? ???? +(? ??????? +? ???? ??? )+? ?????? 
(8) 
Ideally, the inertial power could convert fully into elastic 
power and vice versa like an oscillating spring-mass system, 
thus conserving energy within the system.  The apparent 
power drawn from motor for these two components is zero if 
they are same in magnitude with no loss:   
? ???????? +? ??????? =0 
(9) 
The inertial power depends on the wing kinematics. Average 
inertial power of a sinusoidal wing stroke can be estimated 
from the maximum change of wing kinetic energy over a 
quarter cycle of the wing beat, where the speed peaks at the 
mid-stroke [4] [5]:

where f is the wing beat frequency, ? is the wing stroke 
angle, and J

is the rotational inertia of each wing.  
The average elastic power is the energy stored or released 
from the elastic thorax during a quarter cycle and worked 
against the inertial power: 
??
??????? =?4? ? ??????? 
(11) 
 
B. Design of Experiment 
Both the compliant mechanism and rigid-body 
mechanism are subjected to the same tethered flight tests.  
They are designed to beat the same wings with the same 
wing stroke, and consequently produce almost the same 
thrust at the same wing beat frequency. The two differed 
only in the capability for energy storage. As such, any power 
saving by the compliant mechanism should reflect the effect 
of the elastic energy storage. In the experiments, wing stroke 
angle is measured by imaging processing; quasi-steady 
thrust is measured using the pendulum swing method (see 
Fig. 8). The thrust provides the lift that raises the flapper up 
as frequency increases, like the thrust from helicopter rotor. 
The power consumed by the motor to drive a wing flapper 
can be measured using a source-measure unit, which can 
resolve time varying electrical signals. As such, mechanical 
torques and power can be deduced from the electrical 
measurement. 
 
Fig. 8 Tethered hovering flight test using a simple pendulum method: 
The idle flapper is at bottommost position under the effect of gravity; 
when the wing flappers are beating at 33 Hz, thrust is produced to raise 
the pendulum of wing flappers above the horizon against gravity. 
The prototypes are first driven with wings in air to obtain 
the total mechanical cost. Then, the aerodynamic power is 
removed by flapping in vacuum, to obtain apparent inertial 
power and friction loss. Lastly, prototypes are operated 
without wings to get friction loss. Hence, the power 
differences due to these distinct conditions should provide a 
measure for each component of energetic costs. All tests 
were carried out multiple times to minimize random error.

The dynamic coupling of the non-linear wing-thorax 
system is left for future investigation as energetic costs are 
of more concern in this study. 
 
C. Results and Discussions 
Both mechanisms beat wing in sinusoidal profile over 
time (Fig. 9). They have almost the same dynamic wing 
stroke at 22Hz and above (see Fig. 10), though compliant 
mechanism has a much lower static stroke. The enhancement 
of dynamic wing stroke over the static one is attributed to 
hinge flexibility of compliant mechanism.  
 
Fig. 9 Flapping trajectory observed using high speed camera. 
 
Fig. 10 Wing stroke observed along frequency for both compliant 
mechanism and rigid body mechanism. 
As the wing beats faster, more thrust is generated (Fig. 
11) at the expense of more power (Fig. 12). Both 
mechanisms produce almost the same thrust at the wing beat 
frequency of 22Hz and above. However, the compliant 
mechanism consumes less power. To lift up its own weight, 
the compliant mechanism consumes about 1.5W and 
presents a power savings of 22% as compared to the rigid 
body mechanism. 
After all, the energetic costs to beat wings increase with 
wing beat frequency in both air and vacuum, so does the 
friction loss (see Fig. 13 and Fig. 14). Comparison of each 
power components showed that apparent inertial power is 
almost zero up to 25Hz, beyond which the wing kinetic 
energy exceeds the elastic energy storage capacity. In 
comparison, the rigid body mechanism expended 
substantially large portion of total power on overcoming 
wing inertia throughout the whole frequency range tested. At 
30Hz, near take off, the compliant mechanism expends only 
16% of total power to overcome inertia, while rigid body 
mechanism consumes higher power at 36% (see Fig. 15). In 
short, the elastic energy storage helped to reduce the inertial 
power for flapping flight.  
Compared to other reported designs, our thorax-like 
compliant mechanism successfully integrated sufficient 
elastic energy storage within the lightweight compliant 
hinges (see Table 3). All other designs required elastic 
elements to be added to the mechanism.

IV. CONCLUSION 
We presented a thorax-like composite compliant 
mechanism with integrated elastic energy storage.  Sufficient 
energy is stored in the multiple-stiffness hinges which are 
configured to achieve large wing stroke at low risk of fatigue 
fracture. Our results showed that elastic energy storage saves 
power by recovering wing inertial power. The power savings 
is optimum when the elastic energy storage matches the 
wing kinetic energy. However, the introduction of elastic 
energy storage should not add significant payload which 
cancels out power savings. Therefore, our method of 
integrating desired elastic energy storage into lightweight 
compliant mechanism can be used for future energy-efficient 
FWMAV.
