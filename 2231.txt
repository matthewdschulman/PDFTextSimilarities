Comparison of Ornithopter Wind Tunnel Force Measurements with
Free Flight
Cameron Rose and Ronald S. Fearing
Abstract— Developing models of ﬂapping-winged ﬂiers in free
ﬂight is vital for accurate control. The aerodynamics associated
with ﬂapping-winged ﬂight are complex. Hence, a look-up
table ﬂight force model from wind tunnel data is a practical
approach. In this work, we compare the ﬂight of an ornithopter
micro aerial vehicle (MA V), using free ﬂight data collected
from a Vicon motion capture system, to measured wind tunnel
force and moment values. We compare the two data sets at
equilibrium as a metric to determine the quality of the wind
tunnel ﬂight force estimation.
To compare the two data sets, we ﬁnd the predicted equi-
librium angle of attack and velocity for the ornithopter in free
ﬂight. For a given ﬂapping frequency and pitch control elevator
deﬂection angle at free ﬂight equilibrium, we compute the level
sets at zero for pitch moment, net horizontal force, and net
vertical force from the wind tunnel data. We then use the
point on the zero moment level set that minimizes the vertical
and horizontal force. The angle of attack and velocity at this
minimal point are the wind tunnel predicted equilibrium point
and are compared to the analogous free ﬂight equilibrium point.
We determined that the wind tunnel underestimates the angle
of attack of the equilibrium point observed in free ﬂight by 15
degrees, while the equilibrium velocity has an error of 0.1 m/s
between the two sets at an average ﬂight speed of 2 m/s.
I. INTRODUCTION
The aerodynamics of ﬂapping-winged ﬂight are nonlinear
and complex, and are difﬁcult to model. The ﬂapping of the
wings creates an unsteady airﬂow around the control surfaces
of the ﬂier, increasing the complexity of the aerodynamics
associated with the surfaces [1][2][3][4]. An understanding
of the behavior of these ﬂiers in free ﬂight is necessary for
successful control.
One method of understanding the ﬂight behavior of
these ﬂiers involves modeling the wing motion during each
wing stroke, e.g. using blade element theory [5][6][7].
Another method involves multi-body modeling to account
for the changing mass distribution as the ﬂier ﬂaps its
wings [8][9][10].
We desire a simpliﬁed representation of the aerodynamics
which can be used for on-board model-based control in 10
gram scale ﬂiers. The previous control strategies used for
ornithopters of this scale were based upon Proportional-
Integral-Differential (PID) control schemes for target track-
ing or height regulation [11][12]. Information about the
aerodynamic interactions of the ornithopter can produce a

more robust model that can be used in more sophisticated
control schemes such as Linear-Quadratic Regulator (LQR)
or Model Predictive Control (MPC).
For this aerodynamic modeling, it is necessary to collect
data that can be used to estimate the behavior of the MA V
over time. Common approaches to develop these models
include averaging the ﬂight behavior over the wing beat
period, and using linear low-dimensional models to predict
the ﬂight behavior over time. It has been shown that using
time averaged aerodynamic data is a valid approximation
over a given wing stroke [13][14]. Wind tunnels are often
used to measure aerodynamic properties of robotic ﬂiers.
Although some of the degrees of freedom are constrained
by the mounting mechanism, this method of aerodynamic
force and moment measurement has been used by previous
researchers for the purpose of developing aerodynamic mod-
els for simulation and control. A simulation of insect ﬂight
for the Roboﬂy project uses aerodynamic models based upon
wind tunnel measurements [15][16]. In addition, mounted
sensor measurements have also been used to measure the
aerodynamic properties of wings for modelling by Khan and
Agrawal [17]. Lee and Han recently implemented a non-
contact magnetic suspension and balance system to control
the attitude of an experimental model [18]. This setup allows
for data collection and controller veriﬁcation using selected
degrees of freedom.
An alternative method to using stationary wind tunnel
data for modeling is collecting free ﬂight telemetry data
using a motion tracking system. Humbert et al. utilized this
method to create a dynamic model for their ”Slow Hawk”
ornithopter [20]. The ﬂight data collected was used to ﬁt
parameters to a multi-body dynamic model, and wind tunnel

tests were used to determine the associated aerodynamic
model. This method, however, involves the ﬁtting of many
model parameters.
In this paper, we consider both an experimental data set
collected at equilibrium free-ﬂight conditions and a wind
tunnel data set for an ornithopter. We compare the ﬂight
conditions of the free-ﬂight equilibrium and the wind tunnel
predicted equilibrium to determine if the wind tunnel data
can be utilized to accurately predict the free ﬂight of the
ornithopter in future simulation models.
II. ROBOTIC PLATFORM
A. H
2
Bird Ornithopter
The robotic platform used is a ﬂapping-winged MA V
known as the H
2
Bird (Fig. 1) [19]. The H
2
Bird has a custom
built carbon ﬁber frame, carbon ﬁber reinforced clap-ﬂing
wings, and carbon ﬁber reinforced tail, and uses the Silverlit
i-Bird RC ﬂier power train
1
. The wingspan of the H
2
Bird is
26.5 cm and its mass is 13.6 grams. Yaw and pitch control
are provided by a tail-mounted propeller and servo-controlled
elevator, respectively (Fig. 2). For control and sensing, the
H
2
Bird uses an on-board ImageProc 2.4
2
controller that
includes a 40 MIPS microprocessor, 6 DOF IMU, IEEE
802.15.4 radio, and motor drivers, powered by a 90 mAH
lithium polymer battery [11].
B. Attitude Control
The attitude estimation and control of the H
2
Bird are both
performed on-board. This process is depicted in Fig. 3 in the
internal control block, and is computed at 300Hz. To estimate
the pose of the H
2
Bird, the angular rate values measured
by the on-board gyroscope are integrated over time. Sepa-
rate proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controllers use the
estimated pose and the desired pitch () and yaw angles,
provided by an external source, to determine the necessary
control surface inputs to the elevator servo and tail propeller
motor to achieve the desired pose. Another PID controller
is used to regulate the ﬂap frequency of the H
2
Bird, with
the desired frequency provided by the external source, and

III. EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS
A. Wind Tunnel
To determine the forces and moments that the ornithopter
experiences in ﬂight, wind tunnel data were collected over a
series of trials using an ATI Nano17 force-torque sensor. The
ornithopter was afﬁxed to an acrylic mount attached to the
sensor and facing into the air stream, as shown in Fig. 4. A
3 mm piece of foam was placed between the acrylic mount
and the H
2
Bird to provide damping for the high frequency
oscillations that the ﬂapping of the wings causes in the pitch
moment signal. The H
2
Bird was attached at approximately
its center of mass, although this point ﬂuctuates as the wings
open and close. This ﬂuctuation is minimal, however, so it
was discounted in the data collection. For each trial, force
and moment data were collected over a period of 7 seconds
at all combinations of wing duty cycles, wind speeds, angles
of attack, and elevator deﬂections shown in Table I, a total
of 420 data sets. The wing motor duty cycle corresponds to
ﬂapping frequencies between 14 and 20 Hz, and a positive
elevator deﬂection angle corresponds to an upward pitch.
Each trial was averaged over the 7 seconds.
The collected data form a data set with 4 inputs and 3
outputs. The outputs are the lift force (L) and thrust force (T )
in body coordinates, and the pitch moment (M), which are
dependent upon the inputs of the duty cycle, angle of attack
(), wind speed (V ), and elevator deﬂection, the directions
of which are shown in the free body diagram in Fig. 5. In
the diagram, the pitch angle, , is the angle between the
horizontal in world coordinates and the x-axis, x
b
, of the
body of the H
2
Bird, whereas the angle of attack, , is the
angle between the velocity vector and the x-axis of the body.
This data set is used as a look-up table for the instantaneous

forces and moments for a given pose. The collected data
form a series of surfaces similar to Fig. 6, which is the
surface for a wing duty cycle of 80 percent and elevator
deﬂection of 24 degrees. There are similar surfaces for each
duty cycle and elevator deﬂection, and linear interpolation is
used to estimate values between the measured data points.
Fig. 7 shows a representation of the aerodynamic effect of
the elevator as a function of angle of attack for increasing
wind speeds. Each data point is the amplitude of the pitch
moment provided by the elevator for a given operating point.
As expected, the range of moments increases with increasing
wind speed. The plot illustrates the control authority of the
elevator available to inﬂuence the pitch of the ornithopter.
B. Free Flight
The free ﬂight experiments were conducted over variable
amounts of time during approximately straight and level
ﬂight of the H
2
Bird. Before each experiment, the H
2
Bird was
launched by hand and directed to follow the path shown in
Fig. 8 using the external control loop of Fig. 3. This desired
path allows the completion of several experiments during a
ﬂight, and ensures that there is a straight and level portion
of ﬂight time in which to record a data set. A Vicon motion
tracking system
3
was used to track the position of the H

Bird

at 200Hz, and this translational information was used with
the desired reference trajectory,x[t], shown in black in Fig. 8
as the input to a PID controller that computes the yaw angle
necessary to maintain ﬂight on the target path (black bar).
A second PID controller was used to regulate the height
of the H
2
Bird at a constant height input, h, of 1.5 meters
by computing the necessary ﬂap frequency to maintain level
ﬂight. Throughout the reference path, the robot was directed
to maintain a pitch angle of 35 degrees. The commanded
angles and ﬂap frequency were then transmitted to the robot
at 10 Hz and the internal controllers on the H
2
Bird moved
the robot to the correct pose. When the H
2
Bird reached the
ends of the target path, it was directed to execute a 180
degree turn.
Each experiment consisted of a step from an initial pitch
angle of 35 degrees to 50 degrees at 80 percent duty cycle.
Each trial was conducted during the straight portion of the
reference trajectory to minimize the effect of yaw and roll
on the data. While straight and level ﬂight was desired,
some deviation occurred, although only trials with decidedly
minimal disturbances were used in the data set. During the
trials, the telemetry data, including the angular position,
gyro values, and control motor inputs, were stored in the
ﬂash memory on the H
2
Bird at 300 Hz. Additionally, the

translational position and velocity, angular position, directed
angles, and commanded ﬂap frequency were stored from the
Vicon at 200 Hz. The data for one trial are shown in Fig. 9,
where the pitch angle, pitch velocity, and elevator deﬂection
are estimated on the H
2
Bird and the translational velocity is
measured by the Vicon.
IV. COMPARISON OF DATA SETS
A. Equilibrium Point Estimation
We compare the free ﬂight data set to the wind tunnel
data set by determining the equilibrium ﬂight points for both.
The equilibrium points are ﬂight conditions that satisfy the
following criteria:

Bird in body coordinates, shown in

coordinates, T

. Since we can only know the forces and
moments in free ﬂight at equilibrium ﬂight conditions, we
can only directly compare these points to analogous points
in the wind tunnel data.
To estimate the free ﬂight equilibrium points, we computed
the time averaged values for the velocity magnitude, pitch
angle, angle of attack, and elevator deﬂection before and after
the step from 35 to 50 degrees in pitch. The transitional
portion during the step was not used in the analysis. We
conducted 14 total trials, and the free ﬂight equilibrium
points are shown in the left half of Table II. Each of these

equilibrium ﬂight conditions was then used as the input
into the wind tunnel lookup tables to determine the total
horizontal and vertical forces in world coordinates and the
total pitch moment predicted by the wind tunnel at these
ﬂight conditions. The results are in the right half of Table II,
and correspond to the error between free ﬂight and the wind
tunnel data sets. Ideally, each each net force and moment
should be zero at equilibrium.
Determining the predicted equilibrium points from the
wind tunnel data is a more complicated process, outlined
in Fig. 10. For a given duty cycle, wind speed, elevator
input, and angle of attack there is an associated lift force,
thrust force, and pitch moment measured in the wind tunnel.
We used each elevator deﬂection and the 80 percent duty
cycle used in the free ﬂight experiments to generate three
dimensional surfaces for the net thrust force, net lift force,
and net pitch moment, each dependent upon the wind speed
and angle of attack. Each of these surfaces are similar to
the one in Fig. 6. For a given free ﬂight trial, we computed
the level sets at zero for each of the lift, thrust, and pitch
moment surfaces for the particular elevator deﬂection in the

trial. We noticed that, in most of the data, the pitch moment
never crosses zero, and therefore, no equilibrium is predicted
to exist in pitch. We attribute this problem to an error in the
sensor placement, due to the approximation of the center
of mass of the ornithopter. While this approximation has
minimal effect on the lift and thrust force values, it will
affect the magnitude of the pitch moment data. To remedy
this problem, we added the mean optimal offset,
err
= 0:77
N*mm, uniformly over the entire data set to shift the wind
tunnel predicted pitch moments for each equilibrium point
in free ﬂight as close as possible to zero. This optimal offset
is the mean of the pitch moment errors in the eighth column
of Table II, and the new values, 
0
, are in the ninth column.
After this shift, we needed to ﬁnd the equilibrium points in
angle of attack and wind speed space predicted by the wind
tunnel, which corresponds to the G
 1
block in Fig. 10. To
do this, we solved the optimization problem using the level
sets at zero pitch moment:

is the net
vertical force, F
T
is the net horizontal force, and 
0
is the
sum of the pitch moment from the wind tunnel data and
the moment offset. The optimal andv are recorded as the
wind tunnel predicted equilibrium point for the given elevator
deﬂection. These optimal values are the angle of attack and
velocity on the zero pitch moment level set that minimizes
the net vertical and horizontal forces. If any of the zero level
sets do not exist for each of the three surfaces, we determine
that there is no predicted equilibrium point for that particular
operating condition.
B. Comparison of Estimations
The end result of the aforementioned process is a set of
equilibrium points in velocity and angle of attack for which
the wind tunnel predicts a zero pitch moment and minimal
net vertical and horizontal force. The results of the estimation
are in Fig. 11, where the blue triangles represent the wind
tunnel predicted equilibrium points for the analogous free
ﬂight equilibrium points, represented by red squares, at a
particular elevator deﬂection. There are ﬁve free ﬂight points
for which the wind tunnel predicts the existence of an
equilibrium, and they lie between -2 and 6 degrees elevator
deﬂection.
As shown in Fig. 11, the wind tunnel predicted equilibrium
points in velocity are much closer to the free ﬂight measure-
ments with an average error of 0.1 m/s, than the predicted
equilibrium points in angle of attack, which have an average
error of 15 degrees. Numerically, the source of this error is
evident in Table II in the “Net Thrust Force” and “Net Lift
Force” columns. Both columns represent the total force in
their respective directions and should be zero at equilibrium.
The table shows that the wind tunnel underestimates the
net thrust force for a given free ﬂight data point, while it
overestimates the net lift force for a given data point. With
an H
2
Bird weight of approximately 130 mN, the wind tunnel
overestimates the net lift force by an average of 18 percent.
Decreasing the angle of attack will decrease the drag and
increase the lift caused by the airﬂow on the H
2
Bird, moving
both the net thrust force and net lift force closer to zero,
hence the underestimation of the equilibrium in angle of
attack by 15 degrees.
While the error in the wind tunnel predicted equilibrium
points is easily explained numerically, the physical reasons
for the error are more complex. Since the ornithopter is ﬁxed
in the wind tunnel, it is not free to pitch up and down as
it does in free ﬂight. The forces and moments caused by
these changes in pitch velocity are not captured in the wind
tunnel measurements. Additionally, there are high frequency
vibrations, caused by the interaction between the frame of the
robot and the mounting mechanism from the ﬂapping of the
wings, that introduce noise in the wind tunnel measurements,
but are not present in free ﬂight.
V. CONCLUSIONS
We have compared the predicted behavior of an or-
nithopter from a wind tunnel measured data set to measured
free ﬂight equilibrium conditions. As a comparison metric,
we determined the equilibrium velocity magnitude and angle
of attack predicted by the wind tunnel data set for given
free ﬂight measured elevator deﬂections. The wind tunnel
equilibrium was represented as the angle of attack and
velocity on the pitch moment level set at zero that minimizes
the net horizontal and vertical forces measured in the wind
tunnel. We found that the wind tunnel underestimates the
angle of attack observed in free ﬂight at equilibrium by
approximately 15 degrees, whereas the error between the
equilibrium velocities between the two data sets is approxi-
mately 0.1 m/s for an average ﬂight speed of 2.0 m/s.
We intend to further examine the wind tunnel data to
determine if, with some adjustments inspired by free ﬂight
measurements, it can be used to develop an aerodynamic
model using a look-up table to predict the ﬂight path of the
