Arm with Cable-Driven Mechanism

Abstract— In this paper, the kinematic modeling and control
for a multi-joint inﬂatable robot arm with cable-driven mecha-
nism are proposed. The soft inﬂatable robot arm is capable of
imitating human arms to realize remote interaction. The weight
of the arm is only about 50 grams, and collision safe. To solve
the challenge problems of kinematics of the soft inﬂatable arm,
new approaches are proposed, including redundant rigid arm
and soft inﬂatable joint models. The approaches have a good
advantage of applying to muti-joint arms. As our knowledge
it is the ﬁrst time to solve the kinematics of muti-joint soft
inﬂatable arm in Three-Dimensional coordinate space.
Numerous experiments have been conducted, including
movement space and positioning accuracy. The workspace and
velocity are close to an adult’s arm movement space and normal
motion speed.
I. INTRODUCTION
Soft inﬂatable arms or robots are new research topics in
recent years. As they have many advantages and desirable
properties. For instance, they are composed of fabric and
basic pneumatic parts (eg. an air supply, valves, and tubing).
The manufacturing cost can be very low. In addition, they
are naturally compliant, which makes them human-safe [1-
3]. However, the control issue is challenging. As there are no
revalue joints (and hence no joint encoders) for kinematics,
and there is currently no built-in force sensor [4-6]. Some
researchers did investigations on them. Siddharth Sanan [7-9]
developed a soft robot arm, which weights up to 500 grams
and has 2DOF, and can be moved only in a plane by driving
two cables. Otherlab [10] designed another inﬂatable walking
elephant called Ant-Roach. This robot used textile-based,
inﬂatable actuators that contract upon inﬂation into specially-
designed shapes to effect motion. Since these robots are
built out of lightweight fabric-and-air structural members
and powered via pneumatics or hydraulics, they exhibited
large strength-to-weight ratios. Otherlab [10] seems focus on
payload target, since Ant-Roach is less than 32 kilograms but
can probably support up to about 454 kilograms. Otherlab
developed another inﬂatable robot arm [10], which is a
lightweight, low-cost inﬂatable robotic arm. The arm weighs
is about 2 kilograms and is still able to lift several hundred
pounds with just about 400 kPa. Saul [11] designed another
inﬂatable walking elephant. He involved to use compressed

Fig. 1. The telepresense robot
air to drive mechanical motion. These robots or arms can be
moved by controlling air supply, valves, and tubing. How-
ever, there are no clear descriptions about their kinematics
models or control algorithms. Although Siddharth Sanan [7-
9] designed a inﬂatable arm and could move in a coordinate
system, he seemed not to develop soft inﬂatable joint models
in Three-Dimensional coordinate space.
In this paper, we mainly focus on solving the challenge
problems of kinematic modeling and control for a multi-
joint inﬂatable robot arm with cable-driven mechanism. To
evaluate the performances and demonstrate the application
of the novel inﬂatable arm, two arms are installed on a
telepresense robot, which are shown in Fig. 1. The soft
inﬂatable arm can be moved by pulling six cables installed
in shoulder joint and elbow joint. It is only about 50 grams
in weight, and can work only in 7:323:45 kPa in pressure.
It requires less pressure and has lighter weight. Meanwhile,
new approaches are proposed to solve the challenge prob-
lems of kinematics, which includes 4DOF redundant rigid
arm modeling and kinematics, soft inﬂatable joint modeling
and kinematics. These models and algorithms can apply to
muti-link soft inﬂatable arms. Numerous experiments have
been conducted, including movement space and positioning
accuracy in Three-Dimensional coordinate system.
In Section II, hardware design and implementation are pro-
posed. In Section III, modeling and kinematics are proposed
for the soft inﬂatable arm. In Section IV , the experiments and
results are proposed. Finally, the contributions of the current

work and future work are concluded in section V .
II. HARDWARE DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION
The proposed soft inﬂatable arm is shown in Fig. 2. The
structure (including upper arm, lower arm, shoulder joint, and
elbow joint) is based on Thermoplastic Polyurethane (TPU),
which is a very common, low cost, and environmental friend-
ly inﬂatable material. The length of upper arm and lower
arm are 190mm and 190mm. The shape of shoulder joint
and elbow joint are cambers, with middle section diameter
40mm, and both ends diameters 70mm. The thickness of the
soft inﬂatable is 0.18mm, and the weight is only about 50
grams. The joint can be driven by three cables (diameter
is 0.3mm) installed in the shoulder joint and elbow joint,
respectively. Each cable in the arm pass though shoulder
driven tubes, and elbow driven tubes, which are ﬁxed on
shoulder joint and elbow joint by a pair of micro nozzles.
These tubes are used to avoid air leakage and protect cables,
which inner diameters are 1mm. Shoulder driven tubes and
elbow driven tubes are connected to external driven tubes.
The external driven tubes are connected to driven actuators.
The arm can be moved by pulling six cables by driven
actuators. Shoulder connector is used to connect the arm to
the robot body. In addition, external tube can be very long,
so driven actuators can be installed remotely, such as the
bottom of the robot body as shown in Fig. 1. Air pressure
is 7:32 3:45 kPa in the robot arm. The arm merits of this
novel soft inﬂatable arm is that, it combines the skin and
framework as a whole, and very light, easy and low cost for
fabrication. Meanwhile, most of the cables are wired inside
the arm and make results in a tidy appearance. More detailed
hardware designs are proposed in our another paper [12].
III. KINEMATIC MODELING
Modeling and kinematics in coordinate system for the soft
inﬂatable arm are proposed as follows: Firstly, establish a
4DOF redundant rigid arm, and compute inverse kinematics
by inputting the end effector position P (x;y;z) and out-
putting joint angles  (
1
;
2
;
3
;
4
), whereP2R and 2
R. Secondly, establish joint models for the soft inﬂatable
arm, where shoulder joint and elbow joint map to joint angles

12
(
1
;
2
) and 
34
(
3
;
4
) in the rigid arm, respectively.
The target of inverse kinematics for the soft joint is solved
by inputting joint angles 
12
(
1
;
2
) and 
34
(
3
;

) and
outputting shoulder cables length L

) and elbow
cables length L

(l

), respectively. Where 


34

2 R. Finally, the perfor-
mances of the soft inﬂatable arm are elevated by applying
these algorithms.
A. Kinematics of 4DOF redundant rigid arm
As mentioned above, the input only has an end effec-
tor position P (x;y;z), but need to get four joint angles
 (
1
;
2
;
3
;
4
), so the system is redundant. We take the
right arm as an example, and proposed the coordinate deﬁni-
tion of the 4DOF redundant rigid arm is shown in Fig. 3. The
standard DH (Denavit-Hartenberg) parameters are shown in
Table 1. In Fig. 3, Coordinate system (X0,Y0,Z0) is ﬁxed

D. MSIJM kinematics
As mentioned above, the target of MSIJM kinematics is
also to determine the length of three cables by giving 

steps.
1) Get intersections on the rotation center plane (plane
C):: As shown in Fig. 5 and Fig. 6, positions in moving
platform (Xc,Yc,Zc) can be transfer to ﬁxed base (Xa,Ya,Za)
by Eq. (8), then

and (

and
*
v

= (

. Then the normal vector of

and

follow as

be calculated as a length of the arc.
2) Get intersections direction:: The next step is to calcu-
late the intersections between P

is no more than r

4) Elbow joint kinematics:: For elbow joint, the

calculated by replacing 

by using
Eq. (4)  Eq. (32), respectively. But there is a rotation

where  is used to determine the rotation direction. Finally,
the offset will add the rotation to elbow joint to match the
posture of rigid arm. For the elbow joint, a new in Eq. (4)
will be modiﬁed as,
 =a tan 2(y

Meanwhile this method can be applied to more than two joint
by compensating  in Eq. (34).
IV. EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS
To verify the kinematics model of the soft inﬂatable arm,
numerous experiments are carried out. The right soft inﬂat-
able arm moves in X, Y , and Z direction are shown in Fig.
11, Fig. 12, and Fig. 13, respectively. All these experiments
follow the rule that when one directional position of the end
effector varies, the other two directional positions will be
ﬁxed. The drawn horizontal and vertical lines in the ﬁgures
are used to compare the desired and actual positions.
 
Horizontal line
 
 
Fig. 11. Soft inﬂatable arm moves in X direction
 
Horizontal line
 
Fig. 13 
Fig. 12. Soft inﬂatable arm moves in Y direction
The experimental results show that the positioning accu-
racy in X, Y , and Z directions are 33.906mm, 34.213mm,
and 29.435mm, respectively, which are the mean values of
differences between desired positions and actual positions of
end effector. Also, numerous experimental results show that
the end effector workspace in coordinate systems follows
x2 [0; 380],y2 [0; 370] andz2 [0; 360], and the maximum
velocity is about 250mm/s, which are close to an adults arm
movement space and normal motion speed [13-14].

V. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
In conclusion, in this paper the challenge problems of
kinematic modeling and control for a multi-joint inﬂatable
robot arm with cable-driven mechanism are proposed and
solved, including modeling and kinematics of redundant rigid
arm and soft inﬂatable joint. These models and algorithms
can be applied to muti-joint soft inﬂatable arms with less
pressure and lighter weight. Numerous experiments have
been conducted, including movement space and positioning
accuracy in Three-Dimensional coordinate system. The soft
inﬂatable robot arm is also capable of imitating human arms
to realize remote interaction. In the future, more experiments
and performances of kinematics and dynamics will be im-
plemented and evaluated.
