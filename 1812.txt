Abstract—In this paper we describe the design, fabrication,
control,andexperimentalvalidationofasoftandhighlycompli-
ant 2D manipulator. The arm consists of several body segments
actuated using bi-directional ﬂuidic elastomer actuators and
is fabricated using a novel composite molding process. We
use a cascaded PI and PID computation and novel ﬂuidic
drive cylinders to provide closed-loop control of curvature for
each soft and highly compliant body segment. Furthermore, we
develop algorithms to compute the arm’s forward and inverse
kinematics in a manner consistent with piece-wise constant cur-
vaturecontinuummanipulators.Thesecomputationandcontrol
systems enable this highly compliant robot to autonomously
follow trajectories. Experimental results with a robot consisting
of six segments show that controlled movement of a soft and
highly compliant manipulator is feasible.
I. INTRODUCTION
Traditional rigid industrial robots provide optimal solu-
tions for factory automation, where fast, precise, and con-
trollable motions are utilized for repetitive tasks in struc-
tured environments. However, in natural environments and
human-centric operations where safety and adaptability to
uncertainty are fundamental requirements, soft robots may
serve as a better alternative to automation. Soft robots are
designed with a continuously deformable backbone provid-
ing theoretically inﬁnite degrees of freedom; see review
by Trivedi, Rahn, Kier, and Walker [1]. Soft robots can
conform to variable but sensitive environments exempliﬁed
by Chen et al. [2]. They can adaptively manipulate and
grasp unknown objects varying in size and shape [3]. And
their high dexterity allows them to squeeze through conﬁned
spaces [4]. However, a fundamental limitation in designing
robots to be softer and more compliant is that the robots
become increasingly unconstrained, making predictable and
controlled movement difﬁcult. Typically there is a balance
between compliance and internal kinematic constraints that
make controlled movement feasible.
Inthisworkwedemonstratepreciseclosed-looppositional
control for a highly compliant planar continuum manipulator
made almost entirely of soft silicone rubber. The arm has the
advantageofbeingmorecompliantthanmostsoftcontinuum

the tip of the 23 cm long manipulator to it’s base in a loop
shape. The positioning capability is enabled by innovation in
both design and computation that provides stable real-time
curvature control of the manipulator’s soft pneumatic body
segmentsdespitetheirhighcomplianceandlackofkinematic
constraints.
Here we solve the previously unaddressed problem of
controlling arc space parameters for an entirely soft and
highly compliant pneumatic arm. In the planar inextensible
case, this means controlling body segment curvatures. Each
of the arm’s serially connected segments are composed of
ﬂuidic elastomer actuators (FEAs) [5] and these actuators
deform into curvature about a central axis when pressurized
[6]. Accordingly, we make a simplifying piece-wise constant
curvature (PCC) assumption to model the forward and in-
verse kinematic relationship between the arm’s arc space
(i.e., segment curvatures and lengths) and task space (i.e.,
end effector pose) in a manner consistent with traditional
continuum manipulation literature, reviewed by Webster and
Jones [7]. This assumption means each body segment of
a multi-segment arm is assumed to deform with constant
curvature. An early use of PCC appears in Hannan and
Walker’s work with a bending robotic trunk [8]. We use
forward and inverse kinematics algorithms to solve for arc
spaceset-pointsforour feedbackcontrollerinreal-time. This
controller uses a cascaded PI and PID computation as well as
ﬂuidic drive cylinders to control the curvature of the soft and
highly compliant arm segments, allowing for precise position
control of the manipulator.
In general, the design of existing soft position controlled

manipulators are not very soft. Originally, many hard hyper
redundant and hard continuum robots [8] [9] [10] used
an array of servomotors or linear actuators to pull cables
that moved rigid connecting plates located between body
segments. Some soft robots have adopted a similar actuation
schemeconsistingoftendonspullingrigidﬁxturesembedded
on a continuously deformable backbone as seen in the
soft manipulators controlled by Gravagne and Walker [11],
McMahan, Jones, and Walker [12], and Camarillo, Carlson,
and Salisbury [13]. There is an example of a soft rubber
position controlled arm using cables without rigid plates
by Wang et al. [14], but the arm consists of only one
actuated segment and therefore does not require internal
ﬁxtures. Another common design of position controlled soft
manipulatorsinvolvesdistributedpneumaticmuscleactuators
(PMAs). Here, PMAs are embedded throughout the robot’s
body. Notable examples include OctArm IV [3] which uses
18 air muscle actuators distributed throughout 4 arm seg-
ments, the continuum manipulator developed by Pritts and
Rahn [15] which uses 14 McKibben actuators within two
body segments, and the manipulator developed by Kang,
Branson, Zheng, Guglielmino, and Caldwell [16] which uses
24 PMAs within 6 body segments. Again, these designs
are not entirely soft but rather include rigid plates between
segments for actuator mounting and kinematic constraint.
To the best of our knowledge, highly compliant robots
whose bodies are made from soft rubber and distributed
pneumatic actuators are not capable of closed-loop curvature
control. Prior works in this ﬁeld use open-loop control, but
this approach is not sufﬁcient for providing accurate control
of body segment curvature. Most ﬂuid powered soft robots
use open-loop valve sequencing (i.e., a valve is turned on
for a duration of time to pressurize the actuator and then
off to either hold or deﬂate it) to control body segment
bending. For instance, there are soft rolling robots [5] [17]
[18] made of FEAs that use this control approach. Also a
soft snake-like robot developed by Onal and Rus [19] uses
this open-loop scheme to control 8 distributed FEAs among
4 body segments to enable serpentine locomotion. Again,
Shepherd et al. use an open-loop valve controller to drive
body segment bending in an entirely soft multigait robot [4]
and then passive control in an explosive, jumping robot [20].
Martinez et al. [21] develop manually operated elastomer
tentacles containing 9 PneuNet actuators embedded within
3 body segments. There is also an example of controlling a
soft pneumatic inchworm-like robot using servo-controlled
pressure described in [22]. Here, a PWM approach is used
to drive rapid valve switching to continuously vary airﬂow.
Open-loop control is also common for soft rubber robots
that do not use pneumatic actuation. For example, previous
work on soft bioinspired octopus-like arms developed by
Calisti et al. [23] demonstrate open-loop capabilities like
grasping and locomotion [24] [25]. Umedachi, Vikas, and
Trimmer [26] developed a soft crawling robot that uses an
open-loop SMA driver to control body bending.
Our work differs from previous literature in both design
and control. At a low level, we use a pair of position-
controlled linear ﬂuidic drive cylinders to independently
pressurize the robot’s body actuators. This arrangement is
superior to solenoid valves since it enables precise analog
control of airﬂow into and out of body actuators. At a higher
level, the feedback system controls the curvature of each of
the robot’s body segments according to the arm’s modeled
kinematics. This allows the system to autonomously control
the pose of points along the arm. The contributions of this
paper include:
• The design of a soft and highly compliant planar multi-
segment manipulator
• The design of a novel drive system for soft ﬂuidic
robots, the ﬂuidic drive cylinder
• Closed-loop curvature control for a soft and highly
compliant planar pneumatic robot
• Autonomous position control of points along a multi-
segment soft and highly compliant continuum arm.
II. DESIGN
The soft robotic manipulation system is composed of
several subsystems. Figure 1 depicts the aggregate system,
while highlighting the major subsystems: a soft and highly
compliant manipulator (A), ﬂuidic drive cylinder array (B),
multi-segment kinematics computation (D), arm segment
curvature controllers (C).
A. Soft Arm
The soft and continuously deformable arm (Fig. 1A)
functions as a manipulator and interacts with the environ-
ment. In this work the manipulator’s reachable envelope
is constrained to the X-Y plane illustrated in Fig. 1. By
volume, over 97 percent of the arm is composed of soft
silicone rubber, excluding the feet. Structurally, the arm is
composed of serially connected homogeneous elastomeric
bending segments. An individual segment is detailed in Fig.
2.Eachsegmentisfundamentallyaﬂuidicelastomeractuator
[5] [17] and capable of bending bi-directionally in the X-Y
plane. Bending is the result of expansion and contraction
of agonistic and antagonistic ﬂuidic channel groupings (a
and b) embedded within the segment’s elastomer (c). Chan-
nel deformation is generated by pressurizing or vacuuming
internal ﬂuid (d), which induces stress in the elastomer.
An inextensible but continuously deformable constraining
ﬁlm (e) separates agonistic and antagonistic ﬂuidic channels.
The constraint serves to transform channel deformation into
segment curvature by providing a neutral axis around which
the segment bends. Fig. 2B depicts a segment in a state
of bending. Elongation of the agonistic channel grouping
under pressurization (red) causes the inextensible constraint
to assume negative curvature. Contraction of the antagonistic
channel grouping under vacuum (cyan) allows for increased
bending, but is not required. Elastomer between channels
promotes channel deformation along the neutral axis and
reduces extension along ? r, orthogonal to the neutral axis.
The soft arm, see Fig. 3, can be composed of any number
ofsegments(A).Markersarelocatedattheinterfacebetween

point of the arm’s ﬁrst segment (B) is grounded to the
platform on which the arm moves. Ball transfers (C) are also
located at segment endpoints and enable the arm to move in
the two-dimensional plane with minimal friction. In many
experiments conducted throughout this work the arm’s end
effector (E) is controlled.

endpoints of each segment and ball transfers (C) help the arm move with
minimal friction.
B. Fluidic Drive Cylinders
In order to independently actuate arm segments, an array
of custom ﬂuidic drive cylinders (Fig. 1B) were devel-
oped. These cylinders produce volumetric changes within
the above mentioned embedded ﬂuidic channels. Electric
linear actuators are directly coupled to and control the posi-
tional displacement of pistons within the ﬂuidic cylinders.
Accordingly, these linear actuators govern the volumetric
displacement of ﬂuid out of the cylinders and into the
embeddedchannelswithintheelastomericarmsegments,and
vice versa.
An open loop, linear time-invariant dynamic model was
created to approximate the performance of the ﬂuidic drive
cylinder. Although the model is not used in the control of
the cylinder because of its simpliﬁcations (in reality many
of these parameters are nonlinear), it served to identify the
impact design decisions have on input-output relationships.
Fig. 4 shows a simpliﬁed schematic representation of the
system and the parameters considered in developing the
model.
The equations of motion for the drive cylinder are written

III. FABRICATION
A. Soft Arm
In this work we fabricated an arm from various soft
and semi-soft materials using the processes described in
the following. Fig. 6 details the fabricated components of
the arm. Table III contains the superscript references to
machine tools and materials. The arm is composed of six
segments. Seven constraint supports (d) were printed using
a 3D printing machine
1
and placed into a constraint layer
mold (f), which was also printed. The constraint ﬁlm (c)
was then cut from 0.25 mm ABS plastic ﬁlm using a laser
2
andinsertedthroughtheaforementionedsupports.Aboveand
below the constraint ﬁlm, eight pieces of silicone tubing (a)
were also threaded through the supports. Silicone rubber
3
was then mixed and poured into the constraint layer mold,
immersing tubing, ﬁlm, and supports in a layer of elastomer
to create the composite constraint layer (g). The silicone
was immediately degassed using a vacuum chamber
4
before
curing.
Once cured, small holes were created in the constraint
layer to pierce the embedded tubing at speciﬁc locations
allowing each line to independently address a group of
ﬂuidic channels. Elastomer pieces containing channels (b)
were casted and cured separately using a similar molding
technique. Two channel pieces (b) were carefully attached
to both faces of the constraint layer using a thin layer of
silicone. Lastly, the printed feet (e) were attached to the
constraint supports to create an attachment point for ball
transfers, see also Fig. 3C. Two types of feet were used.
Four feet hold a single ball transfer, whereas two feet hold
two ball transfers. These mechanisms prevent the arm from
tippingandhelpconstrainthearm’smotiontotheX-Yplane.

IV. CONTROLS
A. Curvature Estimation
In order to control the pose of arbitrary points along
the soft robot arm in task space, it is ﬁrst necessary to
estimate an arm segment’s state in arc space using available
localization data. Based on previous results describing the
deformation of a ﬂuidic elastomer actuator [17], we assume
the state of an arm segment can be represented by a signed
curvature k and knowledge of its starting orientation, ?
0
.
This PCC assumption is common in continuum manipulation
[8] [7]. The available data to estimate this state is the X-Y
position of each body segment’s start and end point markers.
Therefore we develop a single segment inverse kinematics
transformation (i.e., from task space to arc space). Fig. 8
visualizes the algorithm we used for determining k given a
body segment’s start point A and end point B as well as ?
0
.
We refer to this as the curvature algorithm (Algorithm 1).
Although we provide our approach, the problem of relating
an initial angle and the positions of endpoints to curvature
has been previously addressed [8][27].
Algorithm 1 Curvature Algorithm (Refer to Fig. 8)
1: A line t, orthogonal to the starting tangent vector ? u, passing through A
is constructed.
2: A perpendicular bisector p to the line segment AB is constructed.
3: The intersection oft and p forms the center point O of a constant radius
arc that connects A and B. Line segment AO is the radius r of this arc.
4: The arm segment’s curvature k can then be expressed as
1
r
. The arc
length L is also calculated.
5: return k and L ? Again, we assume the deformation of each
segment at a point in time can be adequately represented by a signed
curvature value.
B. Forward Kinematics
Knowing independent segment curvatures allows us to
write the forward kinematics of serially connected bi-
directional bending segments, an approach developed by
[19]. The orientation at any point s ? [0, L
i
] along the
arc representing segment i within a chain of n segments
composing the arm can be expressed as:

arm segment at a given point in time. The segment’s start point, A, and
end point, B, are measured and the initial orientation, ?

, of the segment is
provided. Segment curvature, k, is determined.
Because these segments are serially connected and con-
tinuous we assume ?
i
(0) = ?
i?1
(L

). In the case of our
manipulator, this allows the forward kinematics algorithm
(Algorithm 2) to uniquely identify the state of the entire
arm by starting at the grounded base segment (i = 0) where
the orientation is a priori information. Subsequently, each
consecutive segment’s state is determined.
The position of any point along the arm can be expressed

C. Inverse Kinematics Algorithm
Besides the curvature and forward kinematics algorithms
(Algorithms 1 and 2 respectively), a critical component to
the main control algorithm is the manipulation system’s
inverse kinematics algorithm (Algorithm 3), or IK algorithm.
An iterative jacobian transpose approach is used [28][29].
For this work, it means we determine a small update to
segment curvatures that will move a controlled point or
points towards their desired pose, ? w
d
= [x
d
, y
d
, ?
d
]. Each
iteration, the algorithm calculates the incremental curvature
updates ∆k. Upon completion, the curvatures required to
2193
attain the desired arm pose at that control time step are
returned. In other words, given the start and end points of
each arm segment and ?
0
(0) as well as the desired pose(s),
the algorithm determines a curvature discrepancy for each
arm segment.

A current arm state can be easily substituted into 9 allowing

controller.
D. Main Control Algorithm
The main control algorithm determines adjustments to
segment curvatures in real-time that are required to move
a point or points along the arm through their requested pose
trajectory. Before using the inverse kinematics algorithm
(Algorithm 3), the main controller ensures the integrity of
measured data by comparing it to historical data. Once
the required curvature updates are computed, this algorithm
passes the information to the lower level segment controllers.
E. Arm Segment Controller
In order to drive arm segment curvatures to their required
values, a closed-loop arm segment control algorithm was
developed. This low-level control algorithm periodically re-
ceives discrepancies between the soft arm’s measured and
requested curvatures and uses a cascaded control structure to
effectively adjust ﬂuidic drive cylinders and resolve the error.
The controller achieves this by running a PI computation
on the curvature error in order to generate a new set-point
for the positional control of the linear actuator. Due to
the limitations of the used localization system
8
, this outer
loop runs at a relatively slow rate (20 hz) and is initiated
when the main control algorithm (Section IV D) produces a
curvature error. The inner loop, or positional PID controller
runs at 1 kHz to bring the cylinder’s piston displacement
to the newly determined set-point. The cylinder’s piston
displacement is the primary manipulated variable as ﬂuid

visualizes the cascaded control algorithm. Each of the arm’s
segments has its own controller.

curvatures. Each arm segment is controlled at a low-level by this nested
curvature and positional controller. The inner loop runs substantial faster
than the outer loop providing stable control over piston position.
V. EXPERIMENTS
The robotic manipulation system is able to accurately
and precisely control the pose at points along the soft and
continuously deformable arm in real-time. Speciﬁcally, the
manipulation system can move the soft arm’s end effector to
a user speciﬁed pose. We refer to this capability as point-
to-point movement. The arm’s end effector can also track
trajectories. Requested paths can be provided to the system
in real-time. We refer to this capability as path tracking. In
this work we show how we are able to achieve these fun-
damental capabilities while maintaining the most signiﬁcant
characteristic of this manipulation system, softness.
A. Single Segment Curvature Tracking
Afundamentalresultrequiredforpoint-to-pointmovement
and path tracking is the capability for an individual segment
to track a curvature proﬁle varying over time. Fig. 10 details
both the target and measured curvature over time as well as
theerrorofthearm’ssecondsegment.Here,thetargetproﬁle
is a sine wave of amplitude 5
1
m
with a period of 9 seconds,
centered about -15
1
m
. A challenge for the controller is
transitioning from driving either of the two ﬂuidic cylinders
to the other and this occurs when the segment’s curvature
passes zero. Fig. 11 details curvature tracking of the arm’s
fourth segment when a similar target sinusoidal proﬁle is
centered about 0
1
m
.
B. Point-to-Point Movements
In order to verify the system’s ability to accurately and
precisely control the pose of a point on the soft arm, point-
to-point movement experiments were conducted. During the
experiment, the manipulator’s end effector was commanded
to move to four reachable poses (see Fig. 12A-D). Before
moving to one of the commanded poses, the arm was
initialized to a resting state where all arm segments were
depressurized. The time history of each marker position as
well as the arm’s state

, as determined by the
curvature and forward kinematics algorithms, were logged.
The arm was moved to each target pose ten consecutive
times. After a settling period, the end effector’s error in
pose was measured. The mean and standard deviation of the

C. Path Tracking
In order to verify the system’s ability to accurately and
precisely follow a trajectory in real-time, path tracking
experiments were conducted. Again, the robot’s end effector
was controlled. Target poses were updated every iteration
of the central control algorithm. Before each experimental
trial the arm was initialized to a resting state where all arm
segments were depressurized. During the experiment, the
same data as in point-to-point experiments were collected.
