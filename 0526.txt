AbstractÑThis paper presents mechanical system dynamics
modeling analysis and control of a novel compliant ßexure-
based micro-parallel positioning stage. The designed micro-
parallelpositioningstageconsistsofamobileplate,aÞxedbase,
and three limbs with identical kinematic structure. Certain
geometric conditions are adopted to make the mobile plate
with purely 3 translational degrees of freedoms. Each limb
connects the mobile base to the Þxed plate through a
ø
P
(prismatic) joint and two U (universal) joints in sequence,
where
ø
P joint is the active joint driven by a pair of novel
electromagnetic actuators assembled on the Þxed base. The
prototype of the designed system is fabricated, dynamics model
of the manipulator is constructed through Lagrange method
and sliding mode controller is designed based on the dynamics
model.
I. INTRODUCTION
High precision and multi degree of freedoms(DOF) are
extremely important in the Þelds of micro/nano scale manip-
ulation such as micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS),
optical Þber alignment, biological cell manipulation, wafer
stepperlithographymachinesandscanningprobemicroscope
[1]-[2]. Various micro positioning stages can be classiÞed
into serial connected or parallel connected structure, or by
means of actuating types such as piezoceramics (PZT), shape
memory alloy (SMA) and electro active polymer actua-
tor(EPA) etc. With different structure, the positioning stage
possesses different advantages and disadvantages. For some
piled like serial connected multi-DOF micro positioning
stage, its kinematic models can be built easily and can be
controlled conveniently, but the positioning errors may be
accumulated and be ampliÞed from the low stages to the
end-effector. The accumulation of the errors will affect the
precision of the serial connected manipulator seriously, even
will make it impossible to obtain ultrahigh precision [3]. It
is well known that parallel kinematic mechanism possesses
great advantages over traditional serial robot arms, such as
high rigidity, high accuracy, and high load carrying capacity,
etc. [4]-[7]. In addition, the parallel manipulator is able
to provide a very complicated motion for the end-effector
in a ßexible way with many degrees of freedom (DOF)
[8]-[11]. For high resolution and accuracy required in the
micro/nano manipulation Þeld, it is almost impossible to

adopt conventional mechanical parts such as sliding pairs or
bearings to form ultrahigh precision manipulator. Because
the very tiny friction and clearance in the conventional parts
will result in larger errors to the manipulation process. How-
ever, ßexure hinge-based compliant mechanical mechanisms,
which realize the motion through deßections of the ßexure
parts, can be adopted into parallel manipulators for the
manipulation of requiring ultra high precision. Therefore,
the parallel robotic manipulator with compliant ßexure-based
parts attracts many researchersÕ attentions in recent years.
For different actuation technologies of micro manipulators,
the selection of actuators is also a hot research point in
micro/nano manipulation Þeld [8]. Although the PZT can
possess a very high-precision and give large driving force
output, it can only be used in some very small working range
situations[12].AsfortheactuatormadebySMAwithalarge
outputworkingrange,itsresponseisslowandneedscomplex
heating/cooling auxiliaries. Compared with the conventional
PZT or SMA actuators in consideration of larger stroke,
high-resolution and large output force, the electromagnetic
actuator will be a better choice.
In both micro/nano scale or macro scale manipulation
Þeld, many studies focus on industrial applications which
need a pure translational motion such as a motion simulator,
a positioning tool in an assembly line, active vibration
isolation,etc.Itcanbeobservedthat,alotofindustrialrobots
are realized via serial structure such as famous PUMA robot.
Their precisions in range of millimeters or sub-millimeters
are enough for most macro manipulation [13]. As for fast
response, higher resolution and complex motion requirement
manipulationsuchasactivevibrationisolation,surgeryrobot,
complex surface milling machine, etc., most these robots are
realized through parallel robot such as famous DELTA robot
with precision range of sub millimeter to tens of microns[6]-
[7],[11]. With this trend, most high performance multi-DOFs
micro manipulation are realized with parallel structure due
to its advantages [14].
Since a ßexure machine with notched hinges behaves
the merits of the ßexure-based mechanism for micro/nano
manipulation in terms of vacuum compatibility, no backlash
property, no non-linear friction, simple joint structure and
easy to manufacture, they have been widely used for micro-
precision machinery [15]-[16]. Combined with the high
performance of the parallel robot, ßexure parallel mechanism
(FPM) possesses high ßexibility and high natural frequen-
cies, there are no error accumulations and no lubrication
needed. Because of these advantages, the FPM is widely
employed as the ultra-precision manipulation system in var-

ious Þelds such as Þber optic coupling, micro-machining,
vibration isolation device, and semiconductor production.
In this paper, to design a 3-DOF purely translational
moving micro/nano manipulator, the mechanism structure
and the driving actuators are compared and selected care-
fully. Some ßexure hinge-based micro parallel structures are
constructed, and electromagnetic actuators are adopted to
drive the designed FPM. Compared with the PZT directly
actuated micro manipulator, it owns advantages in terms of
larger working range, large output force and fast response
[17]-[18]. Compared with the maglev micro manipulator
[19], it possesses a high payload capability. Besides, the
proposed electromagnetic driving 3-DOF translational micro
positioning stage can be fabricated easily at very low cost.
In the followings of the paper, to cope with complex coupled
force and hysteresis problems, a concise dynamics modeling
via Lagrange method is built and sliding mode controller
is designed to control the FPM for fast response and high
precision performance.
II. ARCHITECTURE DESCRIPTION OF THE MANIPULATOR
The3-Dprototypedesignofthepositioningstageisshown
in Fig.1, it is with parallel structure. The prototype and
the whole experiments system can be observed in Fig.2. A
mobile stage, a Þxed stage, and three identical limbs are
assembled in symmetry. Each limb between the Þxed stage
and mobile stage is connected through a
ø
P (prismatic) joint
and two U (universal) joints in sequence, where
ø
P joint is
the active joint with a pair of novel electromagnetic actuators
on the Þxed stage. Thus, the mobile platform is attached to
the base through the three identical and rotational assembled
limbs.
In order to realize the pure translational motion
characteristics on the mobile stage with respect to the
base stage, the designed mechanism should meet certain
geometric conditions as shown in the Fig.3, which were
deeply studied before in [5]-[6],[20]-[21].

III. DYNAMICS MODEL OF THE MECHANICAL SYSTEM
Generally, there are two methods to build the mechanical
systemÕs dynamical models. One is the vector method, an-
other one is energy method [22]. Since the Lagrange method
who belongs to the Þrst category has distinctly advantages
for complex system in general, it can obtain the simplest and
most intuitive dynamics equations, it is adopted to derive
the designed micro-parallel manipulatorÕs dynamics model
in this research.

LagrangeÕs equations is to Þnd out the kinematic energy and

through the relationships of the moving coordinate system
and the initial coordinate system as presented in the previous

IV. TERMINAL SLIDING-MODE CONTROLLER DESIGN
Since the sliding mode controller shows great robust
ability in handling some nonlinear or parameters
unknown systems, it is an ideal controller to control
the electromagnetic actuated micromanipulator [14]. But,
compared with normal linear hyperplane based sliding
mode, terminal sliding mode controller possesses some
superior advantages such as fast, convergent in Þnite time,
etc.. This controller is particularly useful for high precision
control as it speeds up the rate of convergence near an
equilibrium point [24]. Since the dynamics model of the
stage is built through Lagrange method, a multi-input and
multi-output terminal sliding mode controller is adopted
here to control the stage. Then, let x

2
= ú q, x

= ¬ q
and X=[x

,x

,x

T
.
From the dynamics equation of the stage, we can assume
that the external disturbance forces f
D
and the uncertain
dynamics parameters included in Q
L
are bounded. Then we
have ||Q
L
||<Q
D
and ||f

||<F

. Q

and F

are positive
real numbers.

A helix trajectory is selected to assess the 3-D contouring
performance of the designed 3-PUU large displacement
micro-parallel manipulator as shown in Fig.4. First, the three
input signals for electro-magnetic actuators are calculated by
kinematics if the output of moving platform is a helix curve
with a radius of 500 ?m and a height of 400?m. It can
be observed from the Fig.4 that the open loop contouring
trajectory shows great distorted 3-D curves compared with
the regular reference 3-D curves. It can be observed clearly
that the outputs of the electromagnetic actuators are with

Fig. 6. Closed-loop tracking error.
both serious hysteresis and nonlinear problems which make
the trajectory of the moving platform look like distortion.
The maximal tracking error of the open-loop test can reach
as large as 124 ?m.
Therefore, a dynamics robust controller is urgently needed
for manipulator. As designed in previous dynamics model
and terminal sliding mode controller, it can be constructed
rapidly in MATLAB/Simulink realtime environment for
dSPACE system. With selected constant time parameter T
as 10s, the contouring tracking performance can be shown
in Fig.5. It can be seen that the contouring performance
is improved greatly compared with the previous open loop
contouring experiments. The convergent process also can be
shown clearly in Fig.6. The tracking error converged to zero
rapidly and the tracking error decreased rapidly to 0.2 ?m
in the Þrst 10 seconds, Þnally, the maximum tracking error
can be further improved and can reach 0.02 ?m within the
following 10 seconds. From above experimental studies, it
can be seen that the performance of the dynamics model
and the designed terminal sliding mode controller are well
proved. The advantages of the electromagnetic actuators
driven system lie in that it can reach a large working range
and a fast operation velocity, which are hard for other
actuators driven system to obtain.
V. CONCLUSION
A novel ßexure-based 3-DOF micro-positioning stage
driven by electromagnetic actuators is modeled and the
model based sliding mode controller is designed. The stage
is featured with mainly translational mobility characteristics,
simple symmetrical structure, and large motion range. For
assessing the open loop contouring tracking performance,
Lagrange dynamics model and terminal sliding mode con-
troller are designed and tested on the prototype. The tracking
error can be decreased rapidly to 0.2?m within limited time.
Since high resolution capacitive displacement sensors are
used, the designed manipulator can be taken as a high accu-
rate positioning stage for bio-engineering or micro-assembly
applicationaswellasmicro-parallelactivevibrationisolation
system.
