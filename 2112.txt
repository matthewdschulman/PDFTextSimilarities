Transurethral Laser Prostate Surgery

Abstract—Benign prostatic hyperplasia is the most common
symptomatic disease in men. A new transurethral surgical
interventionisavailablethathasbeenshowntoreducebleeding,

traditional Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP).
However, this new procedure, Holmium Laser Enucleation of
the Prostate (HoLEP), is so challenging to accomplish that
only a small number of expert surgeons are able to offer
it. Toward facilitating broader use of HoLEP, we propose a
new hand-held robotic system for the purpose of making the
surgery easier to perform. In current HoLEP, the only way
to aim the laser and/or manipulate tissue is to move the entire
endoscope, stretching a large quantity of tissue. In contrast, our
new robotic approach provides the surgeon with two concentric
tube manipulators that can aim the laser and manipulate tissue
simultaneously.Themanipulatorsaredeployedthrougha5mm

perform the motions expected to be useful in HoLEP.
I. INTRODUCTION
One of the earliest surgeries to which robotics was applied
was Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP) by
Davies, et al. [1]. Recently, the feasibility of transurethral
bladder access and laser resection has been demonstrated by
Simaan et al. using a continuously ﬂexible multi-backbone
robot [2], [3]. In this paper, we apply a different kind of
continuously ﬂexible robot (the concentric tube robot) to
facilitate a new approach to the clinical condition that orig-
inally inspired Davies et al.’s work. This new procedure is
Holmium Laser Enucleation of the Prostate (HoLEP), which
is known to have better clinical outcomes than TURP, yet is
underutilized because of how challenging it is for the surgeon
to perform using conventional endoscopic instruments. The
intent of the robotic system described in this paper is to make
HoLEP easier to perform so that more patients can beneﬁt
from it. Our system concept is illustrated in Fig. 1.
HoLEP is a surgery applied to treat benign prostatic
hyperplasia (BPH), or enlargement of the prostate, which is
the most prevalent symptomatic disease in men [4], occurring
in 8% of men in their 30s, 50% in their 50s, and 90% in

their 80s [5]. BPH occurs when the prostate grows large
enough that it restricts the ﬂow of urine through the urethra,
which passes through the prostate. The goal of a surgical
intervention for BPH is to remove prostate tissue surrounding
the urethra and thereby enable normal urine ﬂow to resume.
TURP is the current standard surgical approach for BPH [6].
It is accomplished endoscopically, through the urethra, and
prostate tissue is removed in pieces by either sharp dissection
or electrocautery [7]. Although the approach to the prostate is
minimally invasive, the tools used to remove tissue can cause
substantial bleeding (potentially requiring transfusion), long
catheterization time, urethral narrowing, and bladder neck
narrowing [6].
HoLEP can alleviate many of these concerns, since the
Holmium laser “possess the ideal combination of cutting
and coagulation” [8], enabling dissection without signiﬁcant
thermal spread (making HoLEP safer than electrocautery for
nearby structures such as nerves), and without substantial
blood loss. The reduction in morbidity in HoLEP compared
to TURP has been corroborated in a number of clinical

studies [8], [9], [10]. These show that HoLEP reduces
average catheterization time (2 days to 1 day), hospital
stay (3 days to 2 days), and blood loss (eliminates the
need for transfusions) [11]. The improvement in outcomes is
sufﬁciently compelling that HoLEP is now generally viewed
in the urology community as the superior treatment [6].
In spite of this, HoLEP adoption has been disappointingly
slow [12], and it is currently only conducted at a few insti-
tutions in the USA [13] (in contrast, TURP was conducted
approximately 50,000 times in the United States in 2005
[14]). The best explanation for why HoLEP has not been
more widely adopted is that it is extremely challenging for
the surgeon [8], [9], [10], [12]. What makes it so challenging
is that the laser proceeds straight out of the endoscope and
can only be aimed by moving the entire endoscope. Since the
endoscope must pass through a great deal of soft tissue on
the way to the prostate, its maneuverability is limited. Large
forces are required to aim the endoscope and the only way
to physically manipulate tissue near its tip is to use the tip
of the endoscope itself [8]. It is challenging and physically
demanding for surgeons to attempt to accurately aim the laser
using the endoscope while simultaneously applying large
forces to the same endoscope to deform the tissue.
II. SYSTEM CONCEPT
In HoLEP (both standard HoLEP and our robotic ap-
proach) the patient and surgeon are positioned as shown in
Fig. 1. In standard HoLEP, the surgeon manually manipulates
the endoscope, which is inserted into the urethra. With our
new robotic approach, we keep the same basic setup and
work ﬂow, but provide the surgeon with added dexterity
via a hand-held robotic system. This enables the surgeon to
control gross motions of the endoscope manually as usual,
while ﬁne motions of the continuum manipulators at the
endoscope tip are accomplished with thumb joysticks and
ﬁnger triggers near the surgeon’s hands. The surgeon can
view the endoscope image on a screen placed on the back of
the robot, as shown in the Figure. The endoscope that passes
into the patient is of the same diameter as that currently used
clinically for HoLEP, namely 26 Fr (8.66 mm). It delivers
optics for a camera, light sources, and provides a 5 mm
diameter working channel through which the concentric tube
manipulators are delivered. One concentric tube robot guides
and aims the Holmium laser ﬁber (which runs through it),
and the other enables the surgeon to manipulate tissue to
expose areas for laser dissection. The major modules of the
robot are shown in Fig. 2.
A. The Hand-Held Paradigm
The hand-held paradigm has been usefully applied in
surgical robotics in devices such as articulated laparoscopic
forceps [15], a hand-held interface for da Vinci tools [16], a
knee arthroscopy instrument [17], steerable needles [18], and
an articulated endoscopic robot for natural oriﬁce surgery
[19], among others. A simple single-tube concentric tube
robot has been previously employed as a reach extender in
eye surgery [20] and in a ﬂexible neuro endoscope to deliver
an electrocautery wire [21]. This is the ﬁrst time that multiple
concentric tube robots have been incorporated into a hand-
held device. The concentric tube robot idea provides a means
for delivering two articulating instruments through a 5 mm
diameter channel in a small endoscope.
B. Concentric Tube Manipulators
Concentric tube manipulators (also called active cannulas),
are needle-diameter, tentacle-like robots consisting of mul-
tiple concentric, precurved, elastic tubes (typically made of
nitinol) that are independently rotated and translated at their
respective bases. As these precurved tubes interact with one
another, they cause one another to bend and twist, with the
tubes collectively assuming a minimum energy conformation.
The latest models of these robots account for arbitrarily
many tubes, each with general precurvature [22], [23]. The
curved shape of the device inside the patient is controlled via
linear translation and axial rotation of each tube at its base,
outside the patient. These devices are particularly well suited
to natural oriﬁce procedures because their small diameter
and remote actuation enable them to operate in areas where
bulkier actuation systems (e.g. tendons and pulleys) are not
feasible. The size of the manipulator is limited only by the
size of nitinol tubes available (the smallest nitinol tube on
stock lists for NDC, Inc. is 200 mm outer diameter). The
Jacobian of this robot can be computed [24], and used to
enable teleoperation [25].
III. SYSTEM DESIGN
Our robotic system for HoLEP consists of the modules
shown in Fig. 2. The tip of the endoscope is shown in Fig. 3.
The rear ends of each tube of the concentric tube robots are
grasped by carriers in the transmission section of the device,
which is pictured in Fig. 4. An individual carrier is shown in
Fig. 5. The motor pack is a modular attachment that is housed
between the surgeon’s control handles as shown in Fig. 6.
This design follows the general modularity and sterilization
approach introduced in [26]. In this design paradigm, the
motors are isolated from the transmission, with the sterile
barrier between the two, and the transmission is designed
to be biocompatible and autoclavable. Motors are coupled
to transmission elements using oldham couplings, the same
basic concept used by the da Vinci robot to transmit rotary
motion through a sterile barrier.
In our robot we have designed the two concentric tube
manipulators to have different numbers of tubes and hence
Fig. 2. The robotic system for HoLEP surgery consists of an endoscope,
a transmission, and a combined user interface and motor pack. These
components are described in more detail in Section III.

degrees of freedom (DOF). One has two tubes with the outer
tube straight, and hence 3 DOF. The other has three tubes,
all of which are curved providing an additional 6 DOF.
The reason for this design choice is that it is currently
unclear how many DOF will be needed to accomplish the
surgical objectives with the laser manipulator and with the
tissue manipulator. This conﬁguration will enable us in future
studies to explore these questions experimentally.
A. Mechanical Design
The carriers shown in Fig. 5 grasp the bases of the tubes
in the concentric tube robot. Motors in the motor pack are
coupled to the carriers via lead screws and square shafts to
apply linear and angular motions, respectively as shown in
Fig. 4. One useful feature of this design was the incorporation
of a ball bearing block and guide rail (THK America, Inc.
part number HSR8R) which can sustain signiﬁcant moment
loads while continuing to slide freely.
Previous concentric tube robot designs have been designed
to be statically mounted, so weight was not an issue. In
contrast, since this is intended to be a hand-held device,
compactness and lightness are priorities. Because of this, due
to their high power to weight ratio, we selected brushless

8 Watt DC motors (Maxon Motor, Inc.), equipped with 29:1
planetary gearheads. All nine motors were arranged within
the motor pack to axially align with the nine shafts of the
transmission.
In this system we incorporate a Storz, Inc. 27292 AMA
endoscope which is currently used clinically for prostate
surgery. The endoscope contains integrated optics and light
sources, which can be seen in Fig. 3, as well as a 5 mm
working channel through which we introduce the concentric
tube robots. This size speciﬁcation implies that the outside
diameters for the largest tube of each concentric tube ma-
nipulator can be approximately 2 mm in diameter each. The
diameters, curvatures, and lengths of the tubes have not yet
been optimized for this application. Future studies similar to
those described in [27] will be useful for selecting optimal
tube parameters.
B. User Interface Design
To control the robot, we provide the surgeon with two
contoured handles, as shown in Fig. 6. Each has a thumb
joystick with pushbutton capability, as well as an analog
index ﬁnger trigger. Using coordinated motion of both hands,
the surgeon can control gross motion of the endoscope. Fine
motion of the concentric tube manipulators is accomplished
using the joysticks and triggers. The analog signals from
these were mapped to velocities of the concentric tube robot
tips, with respect to the endoscope tip frame. The trigger
was mapped to the insertion direction and the two joystick
degrees of freedom were mapped to the lateral directions.
To change the direction of motion (insertion vs. retraction)
controlled by the trigger, the surgeon clicks the joystick push
button. We note that this mapping has not yet been studied
in depth or via user studies, and that that these will be the
subject of future work. It is possible that alternate thumb and
ﬁnger controls will be desirable.

unit is intended to be bagged for sterility, and the intent is that the handles
would be sterile and coupled to the motor pack housing through the bag
around the user interface, although the current prototype handles are rigidly
mounted and not yet made from sterilizable components.

is shown in Fig. 7. The surgeon speciﬁes a desired velocity
in task space via displacement of the triggers and joysticks.
The desired velocity is converted into a desired joint space
velocity using a resolved rates algorithm as discussed in the
next subsection. These velocities are then integrated to obtain
desired joint positions for low-level control.
Note that one of our concentric tube manipulators consists
of two tubes and has three DOF. In this case, the forward
kinematics and hybrid Jacobian can be calculated in closed
form, as shown in the next subsection. In contrast, our other
manipulator has three tubes and six DOF. Here, the forward
kinematics are solved via the model described in [22], and
the Jacobian is computed according to [24]. These models
are implemented in C++ and sent via UDP to the main
controller in Simulink. Note that the six DOF manipulator
requires a redundancy resolution method since only the three-
DOF tip position is to be controlled. As an initial approach,
we resolve redundancy by locally minimizing joint speeds,
though we have not yet experimentally compared this to
alternate redundancy resolution approaches.
A. Kinematics of the Three-DOF Manipulator
The forward kinematics of the two-tube robot with a
straight outer tube and a constant curvature inner tube can be
written in closed form [28]. Here, we assume that the outer
tube is sufﬁciently stiff that the inner tube does not bend it
signiﬁcantly. The inner tube is elastic with constant precur-
vature k. The actuation variables are a

, which denotes the
angular position of the inner tube, b
1
2s (where s measures
arc length), which is the location where the inner tube is
held by its carrier, and b
2
2s, which is the location where
the outer straight tube is held by its carrier. We deﬁnes= 0 to
be where the tubes exit the tip of the endoscope, with positive
s toward the prostate. Further, let us deﬁne `

and `

to be
the physical lengths of the tubes. Consider a ﬁxed frame at
the endoscope tip, with its z-axis tangent to the endoscopic
axis, and its x-axis deﬁned as the direction about which the
inner tube curves ata

the tip of the robot with its z-axis tangent to the central axis
of the robot at its tip, and its x-axis in the direction about
which the tube curves (note that the body frame moves with
the robot’s tip as the robot deforms). Using these deﬁnitions,

V. EXPERIMENTAL ILLUSTRATION OF HOLEP
MANEUVERABILITY
Rigorously demonstrating a functional beneﬁt to our new
system on the benchtop is challenging, since tissue defor-
mation is such a signiﬁcant factor in HoLEP. Hence, we
plan future cadaver studies to evaluate this. However, here
we provide two anecdotal illustrations of capabilities that
we anticipate will lead to a beneﬁt in those future cadaver
studies. First, if our system can reduce the angle that the
surgeon must apply to the endoscope during surgery, it will
reduce the force that the surgeon must apply, and thereby
potentially the physical demands on the surgeon.
As can be seen in Fig. 8, the surgeon must apply just
under 30 degrees of deﬂection to reach all reachable points
on an ellipsoid representing the desired resection volume
with no tissue deformation (here, the laser ﬁber is held a
ﬁxed distance from the endoscope tip, representing roughly
the maximum extension typically used - extending the ﬁber
too far with no support can damage it). In contrast, our robot
can reach even more points on the ellipsoid surface, with no
endoscope angulation. We are assuming here that anatomy
roughly enforces a pivot point at the urogenital diaphragm,
which we have simulated with a mechanical pivot point
mounted above the ellipsoid.
As a second experimental illustration of system function-
ality, we sought to explore the ability of surgeons to use
Fig. 8. Operating through an anatomically constrained center of motion,
and without deforming the prostate tissue with the endoscope, the surgeon
must manipulate the endoscope almost 30

in plane to access the reachable
area an ellipsoid representing the desired resection volume of the prostate.
With the two-tube active cannula, the surgeon can reach a larger area without
angling the endoscope.
the system to scan the surface of the ellipsoid representing
the desired resection volume. Of particular interest were
the points on the “back” of the ellipsoid that would be
inaccessible to a standard scope without tissue deformation.
Fig. 9 shows a series of images illustrating how the surgeon
was able to use the robot to scan the surface of the ellipsoid,
in comparison to a standard endoscope without robotic
assistance.
VI. CONCLUSIONS
Despite demonstrated clinical beneﬁts, HoLEP has been
hindered from becoming the gold standard for BPH surgery
due to the difﬁculty for the surgeon of accomplishing the
procedure. This paper has described the design of a multi-
arm, hand-held robotic system motivated by the objective of
making HoLEP easier to perform and shortening the learning
curve.
The system described in this paper increases the dexterity
of the surgeon in HoLEP, and we believe this dexterity
enhancement will make the procedure easier to perform and
thereby enable more surgeons to offer it to their patients.
Whether or not the system as constructed in this paper
actually does make the surgery easier to perform remains
to be proven in future user studies.
Other topics we intend to explore in future work are
optimal tube design, alternate redundancy resolution algo-
rithms, and the number of degrees of freedom needed for
each manipulator. We also plan to conduct experiments
with biological tissues so that tissue deformation effects can
be accurately included in experiments. Ultimately, we will
seek to show that a robotic approach can reduce procedure
times and make the procedure easier to learn and easier to
accomplish.
