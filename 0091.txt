Abstract—This paper demonstrates that singular conﬁgura-
tionofatwo-linkrobotarmisadvantageousindoingthetaskof
pulling or lifting up a heavy object with small joint torques. As
a result of numerical optimization, the initial conﬁguration that
minimizes the joint torques necessary for the task is close to
the singular conﬁguration where the arm is stretched out. The
singular conﬁguration has the dynamic feature that the joint
angle vector can be accelerated in a certain direction almost
independently of the mass of the object. Then, the joint torques
can generate large kinetic energy efﬁciently at the singular
conﬁguration, and the energy can be utilized to pull or lift up
the object. The experimental results show that the dynamic
feature is practically useful, even when a feedback control is
applied in order to make the object follow a planned trajectory.
I. INTRODUCTION
In factories, industrial robots are working every day to do
various tasks such as moving heavy objects and assembling
several components. In near future, robots will work even
in unknown environments such as home and disaster areas.
Especially, pulling or lifting heavy objects is one of the
tasks that the robots are expected to do instead of us. In
those environments, the mass of the objects that the robots
should handle is also unknown. When motion planning for
robots is performed only based on kinematics, the planned
motion could be infeasible because necessary joint torques
could exceed the maximum torques. In order to increase
the number of tasks that a robot can achieve within the
maximum torques, the motion planning that reduces the
necessary torques is required [1].
Singular conﬁgurations of a robot arm are the postures
where the Jacobian matrix relating the joint velocities to
the velocity of the end effector is singular [2]-[7]. For a
two-link robot arm, the posture where the arm is stretched
out or folded completely is a singular conﬁguration. Since
motion planning through singular conﬁgurations is difﬁcult
due to the kinematic singularity [8]-[14], singular conﬁgura-
tions tend to be avoided for robotic manipulation. However,
humans use singular conﬁgurations well in their motion such
as pulling a heavy object and walking [15].
In the statics, it is well known that singular conﬁgurations
have an advantage in sustaining a load [16]-[19]. A robot
arm can sustain a large load with small joint torques near
singularconﬁgurations.Byusingtheadvantage,thearmnear

with small joint torques from the robot base to the object
grasped by the end effector or vice versa [20].
In the dynamics, we have shown that the joint torques can
generatekineticenergymostefﬁcientlyatsingularconﬁgura-
tionswhenatwo-linkarmpullsaheavyobject[21].Thejoint
torques can accelerate the joint angles almost independently
of the mass of the object at singular conﬁgurations and
generate kinetic energy of the arm. The energy is transmitted
to the object through the link mechanism. This dynamic
feature of singular conﬁgurations can make the arm pull the
object with small joint torques. In [21], the optimal motion
thatminimizestheintegralofsquaredjointtorquesduringthe
task of pulling a heavy object has been found by numerical
optimization. The initial conﬁguration of the arm for the
optimal motion is close to the singular conﬁguration where
the arm is stretched out.
In this paper, we show through experimental results that
the dynamic feature shown in [21] is useful even for the
practical tasks of pulling a heavy object. The optimal so-
lution in [21] was obtained under the assumption where
no frictional forces act on the robot arm or the object.
The frictional forces for the robot arm that we developed
for this study are estimated from the results of preliminary
experiments, and the numerical optimization is recalculated
with the frictional forces. In order to make the end effector
follow the planned path accurately, feedback torques are
added to the joint torques that are obtained from the motion
planning. The experimental results show that, even under the
frictional forces and the feedback torques, the task of pulling
a heavyobject can be achievedwith small joint torques when
the initial conﬁguration is close to the singular one where the
arm is stretched out.
II. OPTIMAL MOTION PLANNING
In this paper, we consider a motion planning problem for
a two-link robot arm and solve it by numerical optimization,
in a similar way as in [21].
A. Problem Formulation
We suppose that a two-link robot arm pulls or pushes
a heavy object from an initial position to a desired ﬁnal
position. The following assumptions are made:
1) The location of the robot base can be chosen at the
start time, and it is ﬁxed during the task.
2) The contact point between the object and the end
effector is modeled as a joint that rotates freely, and
the joint is located at the center of mass of the object.
Then, the object can be modeled as a mass point.

3) The object is moved along a straight line from the
initial position to the ﬁnal position.
For a mobile manipulator, the ﬁrst assumption means that the
location of the mobile base is chosen and ﬁxed before the
start time of the task. Even for an arm on a ﬁxed base, the
base location can be chosen in installing it. From the second
assumption, we do not have to consider the rotation of the
object. Although there are an inﬁnite number of paths of the
object that connect an initial position to a ﬁnal position, the
third assumption is appropriate in the absence of obstacles
for a sufﬁciently heavy object.
As shown in Fig. 1, the joint between the robot base
and the ﬁrst link of the arm is called Joint 1, and the joint
betweentheﬁrstlinkandthesecondlinkiscalledJoint2.We
introduce a coordinate frame, (x,y), whose origin is placed
on the initial position of the object, and the y axis is set
to be along the path to the desired position. The location
of the robot base is denoted as p

, and the
angles of Joint 1 and 2 are denoted as ?
1
and ?
2
respectively.
The input torques at Joint 1 and 2 are expressed as ?

and
?

respectively. The angles and the torques are represented
in vector forms as  = [?

In this paper, we examine the optimal base location and
arm motion of the two-link robot arm in two cases: Case A
and Case B. In Case A, each link of the robot arm rotates
in a horizontal plane, and the object is pulled or pushed
horizontally. In Case B, each link of the robot arm rotates
in a vertical plane, and the object is lifted up vertically. In
both cases, the initial and ﬁnal positions of the object are set
to be p
e
= [0,0]
T
and p

respectively. Note that
the y axis is horizontal in Case A and vertical in Case B. We
consider a trajectory that connects those two positions along
y axis as in Fig. 1, and denote it asp

In Case B, the end time of lifting up should be included in ?.
Thevalueofthecostfunctionhighlydependsontheendtime
because of the gravity. In Case A, after scale transformations
of time t and torque, we can choose an arbitrary end time
T without loss of generality, if no frictional forces exist.
Even for the robot arm with frictional forces, we choose T
as 0.5 [s] for simplicity.
In this paper, we deal with an optimization problem of
ﬁnding the parameters that minimize J

the coefﬁcients of splines that minimize the cost function (2)
are found.
The optimal trajectory y

searched for as follows. We divide the time interval [0,T]
by n and express the trajectory of y

Note that more than fourth order splines for y

required to avoid extremely high angular velocities of joints
near singular conﬁgurations. To make the input torque

. At each location of the robot
base, we search for the values of  in Case A or (,T) in
Case B that minimize the cost function (2), by the Quasi-
Newton method.
The grid search method is used to ﬁnd the optimal base
location. The region of (x

[y

given by ∆x ? ∆y. By calculating the minimum value of
the cost function at each grid point by the above-mentioned
method, we can ﬁnd the optimal location of the robot base.
In [21], numerical optimization was performed under the
assumption that no frictional forces act on the joints or the
object. The equation of motion was written as

When the parameters ? are given as the spline coefﬁcients
and the grid point, the trajectories of joint angles and joint
torques, (t) and (t), are calculated from the inverse
kinematics and dynamics. The cost function in (2) is also
calculated from(t). The numerical results obtained in [21]
showthat,fortheoptimizedsolution,theinitialconﬁguration
of the robot arm is close to the singular conﬁguration where
the arm is stretched out.
III. TWO-LINK ROBOT ARM
In this section, we show the details of the two-link robot
arm that is used for the experiments presented later and the
equationsofmotionthatareusedfornumericaloptimization.
A. Experimental Setup
The two-link robot arm that was developed for the exper-
iments is shown in Fig. 2. The physical parameters of the
robot arm are summarized in Table I.

Each joint of the arm is driven by a geared DC motor (mo-
tor: maxon EC-powermax30, gearhead: maxon GP32HP).
The current to each motor is regulated by a motor drive
(maxon EPOS) with ROS (Robot Operation System) at 500
Hz.
From the results of preliminary experiments where various
sequences of piecewise constant current were applied to each
motor, we found that the driving torque is generated from
the motor current as follows.

B. Equations of Motion
The equation of motion (5) is modiﬁed so that several
frictional forces for an actual robot arm are included in it.
We show the equations for Case A and Case B respectively.
Case A
In the experiments of pulling an object in a horizontal
plane, the object was supported in the vertical direction by a
ball caster as shown in Fig. 3. For a heavy object, the gravity
forceactingontheobjectcouldoverloadtheshaftsofmotors
without the support caster. The overload is avoided by the
ﬂoor reaction force through the support caster.
When the object is pulled in the horizontal plane, a
frictional force acts at the contact point of the support caster.
Then, the equation of motion for the robot arm is rewritten
as follows.

we can obtain the feedforward signal for motor currents as

The feedforward signal is not enough to make the joint
angles  follow 
d
(t). Although we modeled the frictional
forcesatthejointsandthesupportcasterasmentionedabove,
the errors in the models are inevitable. Small delay and error
in regulation of motor current by the motor drives also exist.
In order to make  follow 

where the parameters c and k were chosen as c = 42.42
[Nms/rad] and k = 900 [Nm/rad]. Instead of (16), a more
sophisticated feedback controller can be exploited according
to the nonlinearity of (12) or (14). The choice of the
controller would affect the values of J
c
in the experiments.
In this paper, a PD controller in the form of (16) is utilized,
because it is simple and widely used. The gains c and k were
tuned to reduce the tracking error while keeping the stability
of the system.
B. Numerical and Experimental Results
In this subsection, we show the results of numerical
optimization and experiments with the feedback control.
Even under the feedback control, the task of pulling a heavy
object is achieved with small joint torques at the optimal
base location.
In both Case A and B, the displacement of the object is
chosen as y
T
= 0.2 [m], and the time interval T is divided
into four subintervals, that is, n = 4. For simulation results,
we show the contour plot of the cost function J
c
. It can be
obtained by ﬁnding the optimal value of or (,T) at each
grid point of the base location.

simulations, we obtain the contour plot of J
c
as shown in
Fig. 4. The grid points of the base location are distributed by
choosing ∆x and ∆y as 0.05 [m], and the minimum value
of J
c
occurs at the base location denoted as L
0
. In order to
obtain more accurate solution for the optimal location, we
change ∆x and ∆y to 0.01 [m] and redraw the contour plot
of J
c
near L
0
as shown in Fig. 5. The obtained solution
denoted as L
1
is (x

b
) = (0.03,0.64) [m]. The value of
J
c
at L
1
is 6.94 [N
2
m
2
s]. As depicted in Fig. 4, the initial
posture of the arm for the base location L
1
is close to the
singular conﬁguration where the arm is stretched out. At the
base locations denoted as S
1
and S
2
, the arm is completely
stretched out at the start time and the end time respectively.
In Fig. 5, the value of J
c
decreases as the base location
approaches S
1
.
In order to verify that the values of the cost function near
L
1
are small even in the experiments with the feedback
control (16), we performed the experiments at three base
locations, L
1
, L
2
and L
3
, which are shown in Fig. 5.
The experiments were conducted three times for each base
location.Thecurrentstojointmotorsweremeasured,andthe
joint torques were calculated by (8). The obtained values of

(16), the values of J
c
for the experiments are larger than the
values for numerical simulations. The differences between
the values of each experiment for the same location could
be caused by small error in initial posture, unsteady friction,
and so on. The average value of J
c
for the optimal location
L
1
is smaller than the average values for L
2
and L
3
. For L
1
,
the joint angles followed the desired angles with small error
as shown in Fig. 6. Figure 7 shows the time histories of joint
torques . They are different from the torques 
d
planned
by numerical simulation, due to the feedback control (16)
and error in motor current control.
From the experimental results, the base location close to
L
1
is advantageous in reducing the joint torques necessary
to achieve the task of pulling a heavy object. It should be
noted that, for the base locations where the value of J
c
for
numerical simulation is much larger, the robot arm could
not complete the task because the motor currents reached
the upper limit.

0.05 [m]. More accurate solution for the optimal location is
obtained from the contour plot near L

where ∆x = ∆y =
0.01 [m] (Fig. 9). The obtained solution denoted as L

is
(x

at L

is 14.12

Fig. 8, the initial posture of the arm for the base location
L
1
is close to the singular conﬁguration where the arm is
stretched out.
The experiments with the feedback control (16) were
performed at three base locations as well as in Case A.
Those locations are shown as L

, L
2
and L

in Fig. 9.
The experiments were repeated three times for each base
location, and the values of J
c
were calculated from the
measured currents to joint motors. The obtained values of
J
c
are summarized in Table. III. The differences between
the values for the same location could happen for the same
reasonsasinCaseA.TheaveragevalueofJ

fortheoptimal

is smaller than the average values for L

and L

.
The experimental results show that the base location close
to L
1
is advantageous in reducing the joint torques necessary
to achieve the task of lifting a heavy object up. As well as
in Case A, for the base locations where the value of J
c
for
numerical simulation is much larger, the robot arm could not
complete the task because of the motor current limit.

C. Discussion
At a singular conﬁguration, the Jacobian matrix J in (6)
is singular, and it can be shown from (5) that the joint angle
vector  can be accelerated in a certain direction almost
independently of the mass of the object. Consequently, the
kinetic energy of the arm can be generated with small joint
torques, and it can be used to pull or lift up the object
theoretically [21]. The results of the experiments with a
feedbackcontrolshowthatutilizationofthisdynamicfeature
of singular conﬁguration is practically feasible.
For practical tasks, the trajectory of the object during
pulling or lifting up it does not have to be restricted to being
on a straight line. The optimal motion planning problem in
Sec. II can be solved in the same manner even when the
trajectory of x
e
(t) is not restricted to being constant. The
trajectory of x
e
(t) can be expressed by spline functions,
and the coefﬁcients of splines can be included in  in
Sec. II-B. The results of numerical simulations show that the
obtained trajectory of the object at the optimal base location
follows closely the straight line where x
e
= 0. In this paper,
we showed the results where the trajectory is restricted on
x
e
= 0 for simplicity of the presentation.
When a robot arm pulls or lifts up an unknown object in
a certain direction, the motion cannot be planned in advance
by the method in Sec. II-B. However, the results of the paper
show that, for a heavy object, the base location should be
chosentobeclosetotheonewheretherobotarmisstretched
out in the direction of pulling at the start time. As mentioned
above, there exists the direction of joint angle acceleration
that does not depend on the mass of the object. The direction
of joint torque vector corresponding to the acceleration is
determined only by the lengths of two links [21]. Therefore,
the task of pulling or lifting up a heavy object would be able
to be done by using the joint torque in that direction with a
feedback control. Otherwise, the mass of an object could be
estimated by several trials of moving the object.
V. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we demonstrated that a singular conﬁgu-
ration of a two-link robot arm is advantageous in pulling
and lifting up a heavy object with small joint torques. Even
when a feedback control is applied to make the end effector
follow the planned trajectory, the experimental results show
that the initial conﬁguration at the optimal base location
that minimizes the joint torques is close to a singular
conﬁguration. Our future work will investigate the dynamic
featureofsingularconﬁgurationsformulti-bodysystemsthat
have more than three links.
