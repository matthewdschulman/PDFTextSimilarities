A Hybrid Feedback Controller for Robust Global Trajectory Tracking of
Quadrotor-like Vehicles with Minimized Attitude Error
Pedro Casau, Ricardo G. Sanfelice, Rita Cunha, David Cabecinhas, Carlos Silvestre
Abstract—In this paper, we tackle the problem of trajectory
tracking for a particular class of underactuated vehicles with
full torque actuation and a single force direction (thrust) that
is ﬁxed relative to a body attached frame. Additionally, we
consider that thrust reversal is not available. We present the
design of a hybrid controller that, under some given assump-
tions, is able to globally asymptotically stabilize the vehicle to a
reference position trajectory while minimizing the angle to the
desired attitude trajectory. This objective is achieved robustly
and globally, in the sense that small perturbations do not lead
to instability and it is achieved regardless of the initial state
of the vehicle. The algorithm is tested in a experimental setup,
using a small scale quadrotor vehicle and the VICON motion
capture system.
I. INTRODUCTION
There exist several vehicles that are usually modeled as
rigid-body vehicles for controller design purposes, namely,
aircraft, spacecraft, marine vessels, among others. New sen-
sor and processor technology have enabled their miniatur-
ization and, ultimately, the development of automatic control
and planning algorithms, which, in turn, have increased their
autonomy, allowing for complex tasks to be carried out with
little human intervention. These vehicles can be used for
targeting, surveillance, inspection, among a plethora of other
applications [14], [19].
More often than not, autonomous vehicles need to move
within cluttered and unstructured environments. In order to
avoid collisions or any other hazardous situation, several
path planning algorithms have been proposed such as the
ones given in [25], [2] and [5]. However, these strategies
require a reference tracking controller to work as intended.
To this end, trajectory tracking controllers were developed
for fully-actuated vehicles (see e.g. [28], [27], [7], [6]) and
also for underactuated vehicles (see e.g. [12], [1], [16],
[8], [31]). Since the rotation of a rigid-body vehicle is
represented by an element ofSO(3), the application of these
controllers to such vehicles is hindered by the topological

obstructions to global stabilization in SO(3) by means of
continuous feedback. In fact, given a vector ﬁeld deﬁned
in SO(3), there exists no equilibrium point that is globally
asymptotically stable (see [4] for an enlightening discussion
on this topic). In other words, if a continuous feedback
law is used in order to stabilize the attitude of a rigid
body to a given set-point (or trajectory), there are certain
initial states that do not allow the accomplishment of such
objective. The controller presented in [11] works around this
issue by globally stabilizing a given set point by means of
discontinuous feedback. However, it has been proved in [21]
that a given point in a compact manifold cannot be globally
robustly stabilized by means of continuous nor discontinuous
feedback. In this context, the design of hybrid controllers
has been shown to be able to overcome the topological
hindrances of attitude stabilization for fully-actuated rigid-
bodies, by means of hybrid quaternion feedback [22] and
rotation matrix feedback [22].
In this paper, we address the trajectory tracking problem
for an underactuated vehicle with a single thrust force direc-
tion and full torque maneuverability. This class of vehicles
encompasses most UAVs and AUVs, as long as the externals
disturbances are within reasonable bounds. Similarly to [16],
[8], to deal with the problem of unmodeled dynamics, we
propose a saturated controller with disturbance rejection
properties. Also, due to the underactuation of the class of
vehicles that we are considering, it is not possible to follow
arbitrarytrajectories.Therefore,similarlyto[12],wepropose
a controller that performs position tracking with asymptoti-
callystablepositionerror,whilekeepingaminimumdistance
to an arbitrary attitude trajectory. Moreover, we achieve this
objective globally by resorting to hybrid quaternion feedback
strategies, as in [23]. The work presented in this paper
expands that of [10] by adding robustness to unmodeled
dynamics, achieving optimal tracking of a reference attitude
trajectory and providing both simulation and experimental
results. The experimental results are obtained using a motion
capture system which, over the last few years, has become
instrumental in the test of novel control methodologies (see
e.g. [25]).
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In
Section II, we present notational conventions that are used
throughout the paper. Section III describes the problem setup
that is addressed in the subsequent sections. In Section IV,
we describe the controller design for the position subsystem
and in Section V we present the control law that achieves
the desired goal. Experimental and simulation results are
provided in Section VI considering a quadrotor vehicle.
Finally, some concluding remarks are given in Section VII.

III. PROBLEM SETUP
In this paper, we consider the problem of designing a
controller for a class of rigid bodies with a single thrust
direction and full torque actuation. This includes, for exam-
ple, helicopters, quadcopters and underactuated underwater
vehicles. For controller design purposes, we consider the
following equations of motion

˙ q =

where p ? R
3
denotes the position of the rigid body in
the inertial reference frame, v ? R
3
represents its linear
velocity, q ? S
3
denotes the unit quaternion that represents
the orientation of the body ﬁxed frame with respect to
the inertial reference frame, ? ? R
3
denotes the angular
velocity, g ? R denotes the acceleration of gravity, b ? R
3
represents a constant unknown disturbance, T ? R is the
thrust magnitude and m ? R denotes the mass of the rigid
6273
body. For more information on this model the reader is
referred to [26] and [3]. Notice that we have not explicitly
included aerodynamic/hydrodynamic effects in (2) because
these are application dependent and typically difﬁcult to
model. In order to overcome modelling uncertainties to some
degree,wedesignacontrollerthatisrobustbothwithrespect
to small measurement noise and constant force disturbances.
Let (p

d

and attitude trajectory which is deﬁned for all t≥ 0. In this
paper, we consider only reference trajectories that satisfy the
following assumption.

In Section IV, we design a controller for the position
subsystem and then, in Section V, we design a control law
for the whole system using backstepping techniques, taking
advantage of the structure of the system (5) depicted in
Figure 1.
IV. CONTROLLER DESIGN FOR THE POSITION
SUBSYSTEM
In this section, we address the problem of designing a
controller that solves Problem 1 when (T,q) are considered
as inputs. The results presented in this section are pivotal in
the design of the controller that solves Problem 1, which is
presented in Section V.
We start the controller design process by giving the
following assumption.
Assumption 2: ThereexistsalocallyLipschitzcontrollaw
u
0
: R

? R

such that (p

asymptotically stable for the system
˙ p

=v
0
, ˙ v
0
=u
0
(p
0
,v
0
). 
If Assumption 2 holds, then, by [18, Theorem 4.17], there
exists a smooth, positive deﬁnite and radially unbounded
function V
0
and positive deﬁnite function W
0
such that, for

Notice that, in general, the control law (p

,v

)7?u

(p

,v

)
is not robust with respect to the unknown disturbance b. In
order to cancel out this disturbance, we redesignu

as a new
control law u

(p

)??
K
(z), (6)
where z ? R
3
is an integral state. Imposing bounds on the
inputs limits the perfomance of the controller, in the sense
that, there is a limit on the disturbances that it is able to
overcome. As a consequence, the controller that we devise
in this paper must also satisfy the following assumption.

Assumption 3: Given K > 0, |b

{1,2,3}. 
In Lemma 1, we show that if the given assumptions are
satisﬁed, then it is possible to redesign u

so as to achieve
global tracking of the position trajectory.

and 3 hold, then the control law (6) renders the set

Remark 1: Notice that u

(p0,v0,z)?A0

thus the integrative state z modiﬁes the control law for the
unperturbed system u

so as to cancel the unknown bias b.
From Lemma 1, we conclude that global asymptotic
stabilization of the set A

when (T,q) are used as inputs
depends on the existence of solutions to

Problem 1 is solved. In the next section, we include the
rotation kinematics using backstepping techniques.
V. GLOBAL ASYMPTOTIC STABILIZATION OF THE
ATTITUDE KINEMATICS BY HYBRID QUATERNION
FEEDBACK
In this section, we develop a controller that solves Prob-
lem 1 when the thrust T and the angular velocity ? are
considered as inputs. To achieve this objective, we extend
the hybrid quaternion feedback strategy that was introduced
in [23] so as to deal with the presence of unknown distur-
bances and underactuation. To do so, we need to estimate

Notice that ?

and replacing (1) into (9), yielding D

troller is robust to constant forces disturbances and small
perturbations because the closed-loop hybrid system (10)
satisﬁes the hybrid basic conditions (see [13] or [23]). In the
next section, we present both simulation and experimental
results.
VI. SIMULATION/EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
To experimentally evaluate the performance of the con-
troller described in Section V, we make use of the following
components:1)BlademQXquadrotor [15],2)VICONBonita
motioncapturesystem[29],3)MATLAB/Simulinksoftware,
and4)custom-madeRFinterface.TheBlademQXquadrotor
weighs 80 g and has a radius of approximately 11 cm.
The overall control architecture is depicted in Figure 4. For
more details on the system architecture and identiﬁcation,
the reader is referred to [9].
Fig. 4: Quadrotor control architecture.
Since the VICON motion capture system outputs the
rotation matrix of the vehicle we resort to the path lifting
strategy outlined in [24] so as to obtain consistent quaternion
representations of attitude.
To assess whether the hybrid controller was working as
intended, we carried out the following experiment: set the
desired position trajectory to a circular trajectory with a
radius of 1 m and an angular frequency of 20 deg/s; set the
initial yaw of the quadrotor to be approximately 180 degrees
away from the desired orientation; run the experiment for
h(0,0) = 1 and h(0,0) =?1.
In this experiment we test speciﬁcally the hybrid nature
of the proposed controller since different values of the logic
variable produce different outcomes when the quadrotor is
near a rotation error of 180 degrees. The experimental results
were also compared with simulation results using the same
controller parameters, which are: k
p
= 3, k
v
= 5, k
V0
=
0.01, k
z
= 0.3, k
q
= 3, k
b1
= 1, K = 1 and ? = 0.5.

Recall that we are using the notation q = [? ?

to represent the unit
quaternion. See Section II for more details.
From the analysis of Figure 5, it is possible to verify that
thecontrollerisworkingasintended,sincethevehiclerotates
around opposite directions depending on the initial value of
thelogicvariable.Figure6depictsthetrackingerrorforeach
of the experiments/simulations. In both ﬁgures, it is notice-
able that the experiments have a small time delay before the
initialization of the controller. If we discard this small time
window, we argue that, even though the convergence time
in the simulations is smaller, the overall behavior is very
much alike in both simulations and experiments. Moreover,
in each experiment and simulation the disturbances were
small enough so as not to trigger any jump of the logic
variable, therefore it remains constant throughout. Figures 2
and 3 show what the rotation around opposite directions
looks like in the real-world. In these images, the direction
of rotation can be tracked by following some features of the
quadrotor, such as the white propellers.

VII. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we described a controller for a class of
underactuated vechicles that globally performs the tracking
of a reference position trajectory while minimizing the

orientation error to some desired attitude trajectory. The
class of vehicles that we consider are characterized by full
torque actuation and uni-directional thrust. This objective
was achieved by means of novel hybrid control techniques
and standard backstepping solutions. Experimental results
that demonstrate the performance of the controller and its
application to quadrotor vehicles were also provided.
