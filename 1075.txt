Abstract— Very long-reach snake-like robotic arms in the
range of 14 meters are expected to be used in decommissioning
work inside nuclear reactor containers. We developed a tendon-
driven system which has the advantage of placing electronic
devices protected in the arm’s base part which stays out of
the reactor container, and only few expensive highly radiation
hardened sensors and tools are mounted in the arm tip.
Generation of large joint torque is necessary to realize such
a very long arm. We applied the concept of coupled tendon-
driven mechanism formerly used to generate restricted two
dimensional motions, and extended its concept by proposing a
new joint arrangement which makes possible three dimensional
motions in a large workspace. Mechanical design, compact
storage method and derivation of the arm motion control
are detailed. Moreover, we built a preliminary mechanical
prototype called ”Mini 3D CT-Arm”, and the experimental
results demonstrated the validity of the newly proposed concept.
I. INTRODUCTION
A tendon-driven multi-joint manipulator whose actuators
are installed in the base unit has many advantages compared
with a manipulator whose actuators are equipped in its joints.
For example, since it does not have heavy actuators in its
arm, it is possible to reduce the total weight of the arm,
and consequently make actuators small and an arm slim. In
addition, since it does not have electronic components in
its arm, it can work in extreme environment, underwater or
under high radiation. In this paper, taking advantage of the
above, we aim at development of the tendon-driven multi-
joint manipulator, which can access to narrow space, with a
length of over 10 meters required in an actual disaster site.
Many tendon-driven robot arms are developed until now.
One of the conventional methods to construct a redundant
multi-joint arm is to radially arrange the wires and make a
bending motion by pulling and relaxing the wires [1] [2] [3].
These arms can be slim and have multi-degree-of-freedom
(DOF). For example, Fig. 1(a) shows ”Snake Arm Robot”
(OC Robotics Corp.) [4] [5]. It is driven by many wires from
the base unit, and three wires attached at equal intervals drive
one joint. However, since each driving wire goes through

many arm segments and generates sliding motion when the
wire is pulled, the frictions between the wire and structural
parts increase when the total length of the arm increase
and/or the arm makes a very sharp bending. Thus, it might
be difﬁcult for this method to develop a very long and slim
arm whose length is over 10 meters.
In this paper, we will focus on the robot arm which has
rigid links driven by wires and pulleys in order to develop a
longer and slimmer arm than conventional robot arm. Since
all driving wires are transmitted via passive rotating pulleys
with sufﬁciently large radius, the frictions between the wires
and structural parts are greatly reduced thanks to the rolling
contact of passive pulleys. In our previous work [6], a
coupled tendon-driven multi-joint long manipulator ”CT-Arm
I”, as shown in Fig. 1(b), can generate large torque in the
proximal joint without using large motors or thick wires by
involving the tension of each wire. However, joint axes of
CT-Arm I in the arm were all in the pitch direction and
therefore the redundant dexterous manipulation was limited
only in 2-dimension, although there was a swivel joint at the
base to make it 3-dimensional polar coordinate motion. In
this paper, in order to enhance the accessibility and dexterity
in narrow and conﬁned space, we develop a coupled tendon-
driven 3D multi-joint manipulator ”3D CT-Arm” which can
move and work in 3-dimension by introducing multiple yaw
joints in the distal arm segments.
The organization of this paper is as follows. In section
II, we design 3D CT-Arm for a decommissioning work of
Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. In section III, we
describe the relation between the winding length of the
tendon and each joint angle and the one between the wire
tension and the joint torque for control. In section IV, we
describe the development of preliminary prototype model and
the basic experiment of control. In section V, a summary is
given.

II. MECHANICAL DESIGN OF 3D CT-ARM
A. Target speciﬁcation
We consider 3D CT-Arm expanding its arm in the reactor
container of Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant and
investigating it, as shown in Fig. 2. In the press release
from Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) about a
mid- to long-term plan for the removal of atomic fuel
debris, TEPCO plans to investigate the bottom part of the
primary containment vessel (PCV) to ﬁnd cooling water
leakage. After boring a hole to PCV , a camera and various
measurement devices will be inserted and inspect PCV inside
[7]. To deliver a camera and the other devices, a long and
slim arm is really suitable. We assume that the required total
length of the arm is 14 m and the diameter of the arm is 0.3
m, because the diameters of the PCV sphere and inspection
hole in the actual site are 18 m and 0.3 m, respectively [8]
[9]. In addition, the arm should be stored small to be carried
to a workspace. From the above, we decide the speciﬁcation
of 3D CT-Arm as shown in table I. The stowed size is
estimated by the size of double doors (single door size is
shown in [10]).
Here, we estimate the torque required for the joint in the
most proximal joint (1st joint) in order to support an arm
horizontally, the tension of the wire which drives the 1st joint
and the diameter of the wire using a conventional design. We
show a geometrical model in Fig. 3. We assume the weight

a pulley as M = 100kg, L = 14m andD = 0.3m. In this
case, the torque (T ) required for the 1st joint and the tension
(F ) of the wire are calculated as
T =

= 6860Nm and F =

D/2
= 45.7kN. (1)
Now, we calculate the diameter of a wire in order to exert
the tension F. If we select a standard stainless wire with
safe factor of 2.0, the diameter of wire d should be larger
than 14 mm. In order not to decrease strength of the wire
by bending, D/d should be kept larger than 15. Thus, the
driving pulley to pull the wire should be larger than 210
mm, which is not compact. Moreover, the torqueT is really
huge. To the best of our investigation, a reduction unit which
can output such a high torque is RV reducer (RV-500C:
NABTESCO). However, its diameter and weight are 520 mm
and 160 kg, respectively [11]. These results clearly show that
conventional design can not satisfy the requirement in size.
To solve the problem, we introduce the principle of a coupled
tendon driven mechanism adopted in CT-Arm I, which can
generate large torque in the 1st joint with small multiple
actuators.
B. A Coupled Tendon-Driven Mechanism of CT-Arm I
We show the principle of a large torque generation on
the proximal joint by a coupled tendon-driven mechanism
applied to CT-Arm I in Fig. 4. The wire which drives each
joint is wound around the ﬁxed pulley (link driving pulley)
of the distal joint. The wire is wound around passive pulleys
(transfer pulleys) from the proximal joint to the distal joint,
and the wires are pulled by actuators mounted on the base
structure. Therefore, tension of the wire can generate torques
in all joints around which the wire is wound, and three wires’
tension participate in torque generation for the proximal
joint, which usually requires large torque to sustain the arm.
For example, in Fig. 4, if we pull three wires with force
F which drive each joint upward, torques generated in each
joint are T(= rF),2T and3T , respectively where r is the
radius of the pulley. Using this principle, we can generate
large torques on the proximal joints by coupling multiple
actuators’ torque instead of using large actuators[6]. In 3D
CT-Arm, if wire is Zylon, light and high strength ﬁber, the

diameter of wire should be only 2.5 mm, and a reduction
unit can be HarmonicDrive (CSF-45-120: Harmonic Drive
Systems) whose diameter and weight are 155 mm and 2.3
kg respectively [12].
C. Proposal of a New Joint Arrangement for Three Dimen-
sional Movements
Although CT-Arm I has a swivel degree of freedom in the
base joint, the coupled tendon-driven arm has only pitch axes.
Thus it is very difﬁcult to access a very narrow and conﬁned
space. Therefore, in this paper, we propose to install yaw
axes in addition to pitch axes in the distal segments of the
arm. Figure 5 a new pulley arrangement achieving both pitch
and yaw movements by coupled tendon-driven mechanism.
By pulling one of the two wires which drives the yaw axis,
the yaw joint can turn right and left shown in Fig. 5(a) and
(b). Since two wires are wound around via pulleys of the
pitch axis, if we pull both wires, torque can be generated in
the pitch axis and the arm can go up as shown in Fig. 5(c). By
this means, it is possible for the wire tensions which are used
to move the yaw joints to generate torque in the direction
which raises a pitch axis. As a result, we can generate a
large torque in the proximal joint by coupled tendon-driving
mechanism using multiple tendon traction forces.
We design 3D CT-Arm having 18 DOF as shown in Fig.
6 using the above-mentioned principle. The length of arm
is 14 meter and the arm has 12 pitch axes and 6 yaw axes.
For proximal joints, there are only pitch axes because main
purpose of the proximal joints is to extend the arm. On
the other hand for distal joints, there are pitch and yaw
axes alternately in order to avoid obstacles in a narrow and
conﬁned space.
D. Containment Conﬁguration
When a long robot arm works in extreme environment,
it is very important to compact containment for the ease
of deployment in the site. In this section, we describe
containment and expanded conﬁgurations of the arm shown
in Fig. 7. It is possible to twist and coil around a square drum

if the distance of the pitch joints are identical. However,
if all pitch axes are parallel to each other, we can not
make multiple turns due to the collision shown in Fig. 8(a).
However, if the direction of each pitch axis is shifted in the
roll direction, it can be twisted any number of rounds as
shown in Fig. 8(b). We derive the phase difference between
thekth and the (k+1)th pitch axis (?
k
) in the roll direction,
the inclination of the whole arm denoted as ? and the joint
angle of the kth pitch axis in the containment conﬁguration
(?
k
).
Figure 9 shows the kinematic model of calculation. We
deﬁne the arm length as L and the interval of twist as d.
In the expanded conﬁguration, the standard position of the
arm is along to the x axis, and its pitch axes are orthogonal
to the x axis. From this conﬁguration, the root structure is
rotated ( ?) around the y axis and kth pitch axis is rotated

proximal joint to distal joint. Each joint is driven by two
motors and two wires attached in the same way as 3D CT-
Arm. The wire is wound around the link driving pulley via
the transfer pulleys of each proximal joint. Torque can be
generated on the transfer pulleys of each joint by tension of
wires.

B. Conﬁguration of Control System
We show the conﬁguration of the control system in Fig. 12.
We can operate by measuring angles of each joint with po-
tentiometers. A tension sensor is not equipped in this model.
The microcomputers are two TITechSH2 Tiny Controller
(Hibot Corp.), and the motor drivers are twelve 1-Axis DC
Power Module (Hibot Corp.). Potentiometers are installed to
each joint of arm. Motors, motor drivers and microcomputers
are mounted on the base unit. We calculate each joint angle
with PC and control SH2 by serial communication. Two SH2
read the value of potentiometers and drive motors.
Table II shows the installed actuators. Motor number i
speciﬁes the installed motori in Fig. 11. Small output motors
are used for pitch down or yaw axes driving and large output
motors are used for pitching up motion.
C. Control Experiment
In control experiment, we speciﬁed a target trajectory to
be followed by the arm and controlled positions of joint
angles with (8). We controlled each motor with PI control by
considering the winding length (S

i
). In addition, we did not
drive the motors atS

i
< 0 and made the motors back-driven
with the tension of wires in order not to slack. However,
since some motors did not have sufﬁcient backdrivability,
we drove these motors in 20% of the value calculated in (8)
at S

i
< 0.
Figure 13 shows the control experiment. From the ﬁrst
position (a), each joint moved along with the curve we set up
and the arm became the last position (d). After that, the arm
followed the same locus and returned to the ﬁrst position.
We experimented repeatedly and obtained the time course
of the desired and measured joint angles shown in Fig. 14.
We can conﬁrm that most of the joints track desired angle
with, although there are some delays, sufﬁcient accuracy.
The tracking of the 6th joint angle is inferior to other joints
because the motors’ torque of the 6th joint is smaller than
others. We can improve it by introducing higher reduction
ratio. In the tracking of the other joints, ﬁrst, the 5th joint
angle has relativery large errors for 40 s to 55 s and 95 s to
110 s. This is because it takes time to wind the slack wire
which is sent out to put the link down in the previous step(
20 s to 40 s or 75 s to 95 s). At 44 s, the improvement
of the 5th joint angle is triggered by the 4th joint. The 4th
joint angle has relatively large errors at 44 s and 117 s. This
is because the 4th joint, yaw axis, moves easily by gravity
if its wires are slack. At 44 s, the wires which are ﬁxed

From the result, we conﬁrmed that the coupled tendon-
driven arm which has both yaw axes and pitch axes can
move without vibration by using a new material wire.
V. CONCLUSIONS
We proposed a coupled tendon-driven 3D multi-joint ma-
nipulator 3D CT-Arm for extreme environment task such
as a decommissioning of a nuclear power plant. 3D CT-
Arm has the pitch and yaw degrees of freedom and can
potentially work in the narrow conﬁned space which is very
difﬁcult to access. We derived the containment conﬁguration
winding around a square prism for carrying arm and obtain
the design parameters to achieve the conﬁgurations. In 3D
CT-Arm operation, we clariﬁed the relation between the
winding length of the tendon and the angle of each joint as
well as the relation between the wire tension and the joint
torque. Finally, we developed the preliminary experiment
model Mini 3D CT-Arm and demonstrated the motion in
3D space with position feed-back control. We conﬁrmed that
the measured angle followed the desired angle with sufﬁcient
accuracy.
In future work, we plan to install tension sensors and
achieve a feed-forward control to cancel the gravitational
force. Comparison between force feed-forward control and
position feedback control may contribute to develop full-
sized 3D CT-Arm.
