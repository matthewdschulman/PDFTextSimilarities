Abstract—An active Tethered Pelvic Assist Device (A-TPAD)
has been presented in this paper. TPAD is a cable robot for
studying force adaptation in human walking by applying external
forces and moments on the human pelvis. A two stage control
strategy was implemented to apply the desired force-moment pro-
ﬁle. The controller includes (i) a quadratic programming based
optimization scheme, (ii) a real-time human motion monitoring
system and (iii) a PID feedback loop to plan and implement
the required cable tensions. The control strategy was validated
ﬁrst by testing it on a dummy pelvis setup. A pilot experiment
was then conducted with a human walking on a treadmill with
A-TPAD. The goal was to apply a vertical downward force
vector equivalent to 10% of subject’s body weight (BW ) at the
pelvis. Results showed that the applied vertical force was acting
downwards over the full gait cycle and was between 8-13% of the
BW . Other force-moment components were maintained within
a speciﬁed range during the experiment. Increased foot pressure
was reported in the presence of vertical force. In summary,
A-TPAD provides the capability of applying and controlling a
desired force-moment proﬁle on the human pelvis over a gait
cycle.
I. INTRODUCTION
Post stroke survivors, children with cerebral palsy, persons
with lower extremity amputation and persons living with
traumatic brain injury are among the population groups who
have been identiﬁed to have asymmetry in gait pattern as well
as reduced weight-bearing capabilities [1]–[5]. Such impaired
walking not only affects the quality of life but also adds to
the risk of falling and serious injuries. Therefore, strategies
to improve such walking conditions are quite important in
rehabilitation.
In recent years, many experimental paradigms have been
developed to study motor adaptation and to improve human
gait. Such paradigms apply external perturbations to human
walking, which result in kinematic errors while walking.
Human nervous system minimizes these errors through recali-
bration of motor commands. Such recalibrations of established
motor behaviors represent motor adaptation and hold great
potential in gait rehabilitation [6], [7].
Several robotic devices have been used to study motor
adaptation and encouraging results were reported in the liter-
ature [8]–[15]. However, some of these devices affect human
dynamics in an undesirable manner because of their intrinsic
dynamics due to large moving inertia. In [16], it was reported
that a robot could affect subjects’ gait signiﬁcantly if it adds
more than 6 kg mass on the human pelvis. Similar inertia
effects on stability of leg kinematics were reported in [17].
Cable robots intrinsically have low weight and add minimal

center of the treadmill.
dynamics to that of the human. However, since a cable can
only pull but not push, these cable robots have been mostly
used in body weight suspension paradigm. In such cases,
human weight helps to keep the cables taut. The Zero-G [18]
and NaviGAITor [19] are some of the multi-directional support
systems for over-ground walking.
Our group has recently developed a passive Tethered Pelvic
Assist Device (TPAD), to study force adaptation in human
walking [20]–[22]. It can apply different force-moment pro-
ﬁles on a subject’s pelvis. In [20], vertical downward force
was applied on the human pelvis such that healthy subjects
showed adaptation in their gait kinematics and kinetics. Such
paradigms can have positive impact on human weight bearing
capabilities. In [21], asymmetric forces were applied in the
transverse plane on the human pelvis. Healthy subjects adapted
to these forces by exhibiting asymmetric gait patterns. Such
paradigms can help improve gait symmetry. These studies
show that TPAD can be used to design subject-speciﬁc ex-
periments and has the potential to improve impaired walking
patterns.
In this work, we propose an active TPAD (A-TPAD) to ap-
ply controlled force-moment on human pelvis. In experiments

with the passive TPAD, it was observed that the force-moment
proﬁle changed with the subject’s motion. For example in [20],
the external vertical force acted downwards only during the
single support phase of the gait cycle. The advantage of A-
TPAD is that it can maintain a prescribed force-moment proﬁle
over the complete gait cycle. A two stage control strategy in
force mode has been implemented. CAREX, an upper arm
rehabilitation device developed by our group [23], is the only
other cable robot available in literature to use force mode
control strategy. One challenge for the A-TPAD is to keep
the cables attached to the pelvis taut during the gait cycle.
As seen in Fig. 1, both upward and downward pelvic motion
can lead to cable slackening. Therefore, a human motion
monitoring system was included in the high level controller
to continuously plan the desired cable tension values. In this
work, an experiment was ﬁrst conducted on a dummy pelvis
to validate the control strategy. An experiment with a single
subject walking on a treadmill at constant speed has also been
reported in this paper.
II. SYSTEM DESIGN AND MODEL
A. Experimental Setup
The passive Tethered Pelvic Assist Device (TPAD) has been
described in authors’ previous works [20]–[22]. Active TPAD
(A-TPAD) builds upon the same structure with the objective to
control the applied force-moment proﬁle on the human pelvis.
The motors, controller and other hardware components are
shown in Figs. 1 and 2. Each cable connects to a hip brace
worn by the subject. The other end of the cable connects
to a motor mounted on an inertially ﬁxed frame. A tension
sensor was installed in series with each cable to measure the
instantaneous tension. Each tension sensor can record up to
890 N and is powered using a 12 V DC ampliﬁer (MLP-
200 and TMO-1 from Transducer Techniques, California).
AC servo motors with encoders were powered in torque
mode (Goldline XT motors and Servostar CD drivers from
Kollmorgen, Pennsylvania). Pulleys were used to appropriately
route the cables from the motors to the pelvis. The design
allows using any number of motors and to change the locations
of motors and pulleys to achieve different cable conﬁgurations.
All motors were direct drive with rated continuous torque of
2.7 Nm. A cable reel of 72.39 mm diameter on each motor
shaft was used so that a maximum continuous tension of 75
N could be achieved. These reels prevent the cables from
wrapping upon itself, as described in [24]. A motion capture
system (Bonita-10 series from Vicon, Denver) was used to
track the cable attachment points on the hip brace during
the experiment. The control was implemented using Labview,
PXI real time controller and data acquisition cards (National
Instrument, Austin).
Dummy Pelvis Experiment: The controller was ﬁrst tested
on a dummy pelvis, which consisted of two 1 ft by 1 ft
square Delrin
r
plates attached together with a six axis force-
torque sensor (Mini45 from ATI Industrial Automation, North
Carolina), as shown in Fig. 2. The force-torque sensor was

brace, when the subject walked on a treadmill at a constant speed. Shoes with
pressure pads were used to record the foot pressure data. (b) Dummy Pelvis
Experiment - Two plates setup was used to represent human pelvis. Cables
were attached to the upper plate, while the lower plate was set in motion.
A six axis force-torque sensor, rigidly connected to both plates, recorded the
force-moment vector at the center of the upper plate with respect to the lower

rigidly attached to the two plates and recorded the force-
moment vector at the center of the upper plate with respect
to the lower plate. The cables from the motors, in series
with tension sensors, were attached to the upper plate. During
the experiment, a person held the lower plate using attached
handle bars to set it in motion. Reﬂective markers were
placed on the upper plate to record the cable attachment
points. Three reﬂective markers were also placed on the lower
plate to record the motion of the lower plate in the global
coordinate system. This information was used to resolve the
force-moment vector measured using the force-torque sensor
in the global coordinate system.
Human Experiment: The controller was also tested with
a human walking on a treadmill at a constant speed of 3.2
kmph. A spring with 2.28 N=mm stiffness value was added
between the hip brace and the tension sensor in each cable.
Shoes with pressure pads and micro-controller were also used
to record the foot pressure values during walking (Fig. 2).
Similar micro-controllers were used to record foot pressure
data in passive TPAD experiments [20], [21].

cable is attached to the end effector and the other end to a motor, shown as

and P

respectively.
For both experiments, six motors were used to control the
tension in the six cables. The cable conﬁguration was similar
to the loading conﬁguration as described in [20]. Four cables
were routed from the bottom of the frame while the other
two were attached to the top of the frame, as shown in Fig.
1. Pulleys were provided on the frame to route the cables
from the motors. The goal of the experiments was to apply a
constant vertical downward forceF
z
at the center of the upper
plate and at the pelvic center. The other force-moment vector
components were kept within a speciﬁed limit.
B. Tension Planner
For a rigid body with n degrees of freedom, n = 3 for
planar and n = 6 for spatial. If m actuated cables are used,
these cables will apply an externaln1 force-moment vector
F, as shown in Fig. 3. This vector can be expressed in terms
of m1 cable tension vector T and the system geometry.
AT =F; (1)
where A is a n m structure matrix which depends on
the system geometry and can be computed knowing the
coordinates of the cables’ attachment points. For a six degrees
of freedom system (n = 6), when F is computed at point C.
The matrix A can be expressed as

In the case of A-TPAD, the goal is to apply a particular
n1 force-moment vector on the human pelvis. As shown
earlier, at least n+1 cables would be required for generating
the desiredn1 F vector [25], [26]. This makes Eq. (1) under-
determined. The general solution can be written in terms of
the minimum norm solution (T ) and the null space of structure
matrix A, assuming A to be full rank [27].

Fig. 4. Control of the A-TPAD was implemented using a high and a low
level control structure. The high level controller plans the desired cable tension
vectorT

to apply a desired force-moment vectorF

. The low level controller
implements these cable tensions using a feedback PID loop and a reference
feed-forward. A friction compensation model based on the motor velocity was
also included in the low level controller.
For T  0, Eq. (3) forms a convex region. Therefore,
an optimization problem can be formulated to ﬁnd the best
solution within the feasible set. In the current work, a quadratic
programming based optimization scheme with a lower and a
upper bound on the cable tension values was implemented.

C. Controller
The control for A-TPAD can be broadly divided into two
levels as shown in Fig. 4.
High Level Controller: This part of the controller plans the
amount of tension to be generated in each cable to achieve
the desired force-moment vector during the experiment. The
locations of cable attachment points recorded using the motion
capture system, were then used to form the structure matrixA,
as described in Eq. (2). The motion capture system provided
data at 250Hz. The markers data was sent to Labview. A
quadratic programming problem was formulated to calculate
the desired cable tension T
d
based on the desired force-
moment vector F
d
, as described in Eq. (5). The values of
T
p
were taken to be the cable tension values calculated in the
previous step, to keep the cable tensions smooth. For those
instances, when the optimization problem did not yield the
solution, previously calculated tension values were used.
720
Low Level Controller: This part of the controller imple-
mented the desired cable tension vector T
d
calculated in the
previous section. It involved a PID feedback loop based on
the current cable tension values. PID gains were selected such
that each motor step response had an overshoot below 15%
and a rise time of 0.08 sec. A reference feedforward based
on motor constants, which mapped the desired cable tension
to the motor voltage, was also included. V oltage in small
increments were applied to the motors and the corresponding
cable tension values were recorded. A least square ﬁt was
then used to calculate the motor constant for each motor. It is
important to note that for both PID gains and motor constant
calculations the other end of each cable was connected to a
inertially ﬁxed point. A friction compensation based on motor
speed was included in the low level controller. To estimate
the friction compensation parameters, a linear model was
developed between friction and motor speed, as described in
[24]. Low level controller was implemented at 1000Hz.
III. RESULTS AND OBSERVATIONS
The location of motors on the frame was decided by
simulating Eq. (5) in Matlab (Math Works, Natick). A set
of pelvic motion data with hip brace cable attachment points
was captured using a motion capture system. For each frame,
matrix A was calculated and Eq. (5) was solved to check the
existence of feasible cable tension values. The location of each
cable attachment point on the frame (P
i
) is given in Table I.
Global coordinate systemfOg:XYZ is shown in Fig. 1.
A. Dummy Pelvis Experiment
The purpose of this experiment was to validate the con-
troller. For this experiment, the subject was asked to hold the
lower plate and to move it in a circular path in the sagittal
Y Z plane. The quadratic optimization in Eq. (5) was solved

values are shown in Fig. 5 for a part
of the experiment. A close match among F

force-
moment values was observed, except for a small offset in the
X direction force values. As seen in Fig. 2, ball type reﬂective
markers were placed on the plate surface, as it was not possible
to place these directly on the actual cable attachment location.
This would generate a small error in the cable length vector
estimation.
The results of this experiment were also used to verify
whether the applied force-moment vector on the plate re-
mained within the desired range during the plate motion. As
seen in Fig. 5, the moment values were within the limit of
2Nm in the three directions. The force values in theX and
Y directions were also within the desired limit of5N and
10N respectively. The vertical force component alongZ axis
was expected to remained constant at -35N. Small variations
were observed in its values, similar variations can also be
observed in other force-moment components. These variations
in the force-moment values were the result of external human
dynamics, which acted on the lower plate during the motion.
B. Human Experiment
During the human experiment, the subject was ﬁrst asked
to walk on a treadmill at an involving speed of 3.2 kmph for
one minute without any external forces. The subject wore the
hip brace without any cables. This session was referred to as
the baseline session. The cables were then attached to the hip
brace. The external force proﬁle was applied when the subject
was standing still and straight on the treadmill. The subject
was then asked to walk on the treadmill at the same speed for
one minute with the applied force proﬁle. This session was

The pelvis and the foot marker data were used to calculate
the gait events. These event data were then used to divide the
other sensor data in gait cycles, where each gait cycle was
referenced based on right foot heel strike. Time histories of
each data set were normalized in time to 100% gait cycle.
In the following section, averaged data from the last ten gait
cycles of the baseline and the weighted sessions have been
presented.
The motion of the pelvic center in the vertical direction
over a gait cycle is presented in the Fig. 6. The pelvic center
was calculated as the mid-point of two pelvic markers in the
human frontal plane. It was observed that the pelvic vertical
motion between the baseline and the weighted sessions was
within the variability of ten gait cycles; and no differences
were observed between the two sessions. The results presented
in the passive TPAD experiment with loading conﬁguration

heel strike.
reported reduction in the vertical upward motion of the pelvis
during the single support phases of the gait cycle [20]. In the
A-TPAD, the other end of each cable is attached to a motor and
not to a ﬁxed point, which was the case in passive TPAD setup.
Since, motors were controlled in force mode, the subject was
able to execute the full range of pelvic vertical motion over
the complete gait cycle. Ability to allow unconstrained limb
motion is a desirable feature for any rehabilitation robot.
The right heel pressure data is shown in Fig. 7. It was ob-
served that the pressure values increased during the weighted
session when compared to the baseline session values. This
result is in accordance with the results presented in the passive
TPAD study with vertical downward force on pelvis [20]. Such
a change was expected since there was an extra downward
force on the subject pelvis during the weighted session. The
pressure pads used in this experiment had a limit of 45.4 kg.
Since, these pads only covered a fraction of the human foot
quantitative analysis was not conducted.
Figure 8 plots the force-moment vector at the pelvic center
during a gait cycle calculated as per Eq. (1). Cables were not
attached to the hip brace during the baseline session, therefore
only the weighted session data are presented. The force values
were normalized with the human weight. The moment values
were within the desired limit, except M
y
which developed
a small offset in the negative direction. The vertical force
values varied from 8%BW to 13%BW with roughly twice
722
the gait frequency, though the variability within the gait cycles
was signiﬁcantly small. The force values along X and Y
directions were within2%BW . The variations in the force-
moment values during a gait cycle could be attributed to the
unaccounted human dynamics during walking. Passive TPAD
experiment with loading conﬁguration in [20] reported that the
external vertical force acted downwards only during the single
support phases of the gait cycle. In the current experiment,
the external vertical force acted downwards over the complete
gait cycle. Therefore, the active version of TPAD provides the
capability of controlling and maintaining the applied external
forces, though small variations in magnitude were observed
due to unaccounted human dynamics.
IV. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
An Active TPAD (A-TPAD) was designed and successfully
tested for applying controlled force-moment proﬁle on the
human pelvis. A validation experiment was ﬁrst conducted
on a dummy pelvis. A reasonably close match was observed
between the measured and the calculated force-moment vector
at the plate center. These results validated the two-stage control
strategy adapted for A-TPAD. A human experiment was also
conducted. The goal was to apply a vertical downward force
vector equivalent to 10% of subject’sBW on the pelvis when
the subject walked on a treadmill. The applied vertical force
component was between 8-13% of the BW and the vertical
pelvic range of motion was not affected signiﬁcantly. The other
force-moment components were maintained within a small
range. This work represents successful implementation of A-
TPAD.
In future, studies will be conducted with healthy and
impaired population groups using A-TPAD to extend the
usefulness of TPAD in the realm of motor adaptation.
