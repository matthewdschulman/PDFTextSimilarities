I. INTRODUCTION
The ability of some insects to robustly traverse rough
terrain [1] and scale vertical and inverted surfaces [2] have
motivated a variety of biologically-inspired terrestrial robots
[3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8]. These abilities make legged vehicles
desirable for exploration of hazardous environments such
as collapsed buildings or natural disaster sites. Our work
focuses on the development of a sub-two gram walking
platform capable of traversing rough terrain and eventually
scaling vertical surfaces. In addition to providing accessibil-
ity to conﬁned spaces, small robots will be more adept at
climbing inclined and vertical surfaces due to surface area
to volume scaling laws.
Previously, HAMR3, a 1:7 g, 4:7 cm long hexapod,
demonstrated autonomous locomotion on ﬂat ground up to
4:3 cm/s (0:9 body lengths per second) [9]. The design of
HAMR3 focused on integrating on-board control and high-
voltage power electronics while the mechanical powertrain,
comprised of piezoelectric bending actuators and ﬂexure-
based transmissions, were not optimized. HAMR3, therefore,
performed slower than desired, was unable to support a
payload, and was incapable of traversing obstacles as small
as 1 mm.
The experience acquired in the development of previous
versions emphasized the importance of powertrain selection
for such miniature legged platforms where payload capacity
is limited. Actuator and transmission selection should focus
on maximizing vertical leg displacement and force while
minimizing mass and energy of the constituent components.
Several designs avoid these problems by building the robot
in the tens of grams mass range [10], [5], [4], [11] or larger
[12], [13], allowing them to use DC or servo motors or
even pneumatic actuators. In the sub-10 gram range, RoACH
[3], uses light-weight shape memory alloy wires as the
actuation mechanism. For our robot, piezoelectric bending
actuators are used primarily due to their compatibility with
the transmission fabrication process and high bandwidth.
The transmission and actuator selection for the robots
mentioned above are discussed in literature. In addition,
several models are suggested [14], [5], [11], [15] that explain
transverse plane kinematics of a miniature legged robot.
However, there is a lack of a comprehensive powertrain study
focused on sagittal plane leg displacements and forces that
would help researchers choose optimal design parameters
to improve robots’ payload capacities and rough terrain
locomotion capabilities.
This work aims to improve HAMR’s walking performance
through the selection of a transmission and actuator design
that satisﬁes requirements for a single leg’s lift degree of
freedom. In this paper, the development of a theoretical
powertrain model is detailed. This model is used in com-
bination with experimental results from a single robot leg
system to choose actuator and transmission parameters that
are implemented in our robot. Using these design parameters,
a new biologically inspired quadruped, HAMR-V , is built and
its payload capabilities are tested.
II. PROBLEM STATEMENT
A. Mechanical Design
HAMR-V has four legs, each with two degrees of freedom
(DOF): lift and swing. Forward walking is achieved by
appropriate phasing of these two DOFs and coupling con-
tralaterally across the body. The two leg DOFs are achieved
by using a ﬂexure-based spherical ﬁve-bar linkage (SFB),
previously described in HAMR2 [16] and utilized in both
HAMR2 and HAMR3 [9]. The SFB linkage maps two
actuator inputs to a 2 DOF leg motion: a swing DOF that
provides locomotive power and a lift DOF that raises and
lowers the leg in the sagittal plane. The inputs are decoupled
and driven by two four-bar slider crank mechanisms actuated
with piezoelectric bimorph cantilevers [17]. A drawing of
this linkage is shown in Fig. 1(a).
The SFB is manufactured using the PC-MEMS fabrication
paradigm [18], as described in [9]. A nine-layer linkage
laminate consists of ﬁve functional material layers: a central
polyimide (Kapton) ﬂexure, two rigid three-ply [0, 90, 0]
carbon ﬁber layers, and two outer brass bond pad layers.
Acrylic sheet adhesive (DuPont FR) comprises the remaining
four layers and bonds each subsequent functional layer. Each
layer is ﬁrst bulk micromachined using a UV diode-pumped-
solid-state (DPSS) laser, resulting in the rigid links separated

by compliant ﬂexures. The completed linkages are shown in
Fig. 1(b).
The resulting links may be folded or mechanically inter-
faced with other parts to form 3D ﬂexure-based mechanical
linkages. Each “hip” joint is fabricated as four planar parts:
two forming the two-DOF SFB, a swing slider-crank input,
and a lift slider-crank input. Assembly of each joint requires
two folds, followed by mating the four parts using built-in
clip interfaces. As the last step, the parts are soldered at the
brass pads to ﬁx them in place. A picture of the completed
transmission assembly is shown in Fig. 1(c).
Piezoelectric bimorph cantilevers, geometrically optimized
for maximal energy density [17], are selected as actuators for
the powertrain due to their simple geometries, scalability,
and compatibility with the manufacturing methods used to
create the transmission. These actuators have been used in
HAMR2 [16] and HAMR3 [9] and other miniature robots
[19], [18] and have sub-mm displacements (thus requiring
ampliﬁcation by the slider-crank mechanism), relatively high
force production (100s of mN) and very high bandwidths.
The actuators are composed of a central prepreg carbon
ﬁber layer sandwiched by two 127 m thick lead-zirconate-
titanate (PZT-5H) plates and a patterned copper-clad FR-4
layer for electrical connections.
B. Lift Degree of Freedom Modeling
The criteria for HAMR’s successful operation are three-
fold: each leg should be able to statically support one-fourth
of the body weight so that the body will not sag (see
Fig. 2 for our deﬁnition of sagging) while standing with
each actuator off; each leg should be able to carry half of
the body weight during walking; and the leg displacement
should be maximized in order to operate on rough terrain.
Assuming the lift and swing DOFs are completely decoupled,
a model of the lift DOF of the powertrain is developed
to investigate the effects of various design parameters on
locomotion. The model consists of the actuator as a force
source in parallel with a spring, a serial compliance term,
a kinematic model of the four-bar slider crank mechanism,
and the compliances of three ﬂexure joints of the four-bar
slider crank. The serial compliance term compensates for the
imperfections in fabrication, off-axis ﬂexure compliance (e.g.
ﬂexure buckling) and compliance of the linkages or skeleton.
An illustration of this model is shown in Fig. 3.
Fig. 2. A simpliﬁed drawing of two robots; the left exhibits no sagging
problem whereas the right version can only carry its weight after preloading
its transmission. The height difference between the bodies of these robots,
i.e. the amount of vertical displacement the legs experience, is deﬁned as
the sag.

Assuming all the stiffness values and linkage lengths are
known, the system has a single degree of freedom. The
displacement of the actuator can be directly mapped to the
displacement of the leg. Writing a power balance yields:

(assuming serial
compliance cannot be controlled). The stiffness of the joint
can be modiﬁed by changing either the ﬂexure geometry or
the polyimide layer thickness. Actuator force and stiffness
can be controlled by changing actuator geometry or the
central carbon ﬁber layer thickness. The transmission ratio
can be chosen either by changing any of the transmission
link lengths or the length of the link that connects the
transmission to the actuator, i.e. the input link length. For
this study, we chose to change the polyimide layer thickness
(the blue layer in Fig. 4) to control joint stiffness values,
since it does not require a redesign of the joints. In a similar
fashion, to control the transmission ratio, we chose to change
the input link length of the transmission (the red linkage in
Fig. 4) which does not require the rest of the robot body
to be redesigned. Changing the input link length without
changing the actuator and ‘hip’ joint positions changes the
neutral position of the transmission and stores energy in the
actuator and transmission springs. As a result, a position
and force bias is added to the transmission opposing gravity.
Therefore, the transmission ratio is effectively changed with-
out redesigning any other transmission parts. To control the
actuator force output and stiffness, we chose to change the
central carbon ﬁber layer thickness (the green layer in Fig.
4) since this would have negligible impact on the design of
other body components. To prevent HAMR-V from sagging
during its operation, the required actuator force, and thus
drive voltage, must also be found. Ideally these designs
would only minimally reduce free displacement. In addition,
the effect of adding the swing DOF should be investigated
to see if there are any issues with the coupling between lift
and swing DOFs.
III. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP
An experimental setup to test the completed transmis-
sions is built from a vertical motorized positioning stage,
a single-axis force sensor, drive electronics and a camera.
The force sensor (RSP2, Loadstar Sensors) is attached on
a three-axis manual positioner (Newport). The transmission
with a leg and an actuator is attached to a motorized
stage (UTS100PP, Newport) controlled through its dedicated
controller (SMC100PP, Newport). The motorized stage con-
troller is commanded from a PC through Matlab xPC, which
also reads the sensor output and runs the actuator attached

component is the input linkage to the transmission whose length controls
the transmission bias (shown in detail in bottom inset in (b)). The blue
layer that can be seen at the joints is the polyimide layer (Kapton) whose
thickness alters the joint stiffness values (shown in detail in top-right inset
in (b)). The green layer at the actuator center is the carbon ﬁber layer
whose thickness controls the actuator stiffness and force output (shown in
detail in the top-left inset in (b)). (b) Solidworks rendering of a biased
powertrain. Extending the length of the input linkage causes compression
in the transmission; the transmission links on each side of joint 1 bend
downwards (joint 1 becomes concave) while links on each side of joint 2
bend upwards (joint 2 becomes convex) and the lift hip link (the movable
link between joint 2 and 3) bends down. These deﬂections move the neutral
position of the leg down, providing a bias to the transmission and effectively
changing the transmission ratio.
to the transmission using a DAQ board (Measurement Com-
puting, PCI-DAC6703) and custom high voltage ampliﬁers.
A picture showing the transmission test setup is shown in
Fig. 5(a).
In order to characterize the actuators with different carbon
ﬁber thicknesses, an experimental setup involving manual
positioning stages (Newport), a six-axis force/torque sensor,
actuator drive electronics, and a camera is used. The actua-
tors are clipped to the drive electronics that includes a DAQ
board (National Instruments, NI PCI-6052E) controlled via
Matlab xPC and high voltage ampliﬁers (TREK, PZD350A).
The actuators are then brought into contact with the force
sensor (ATI Industrial Automation, Nano 17) with no load

applied. The actuators are driven with varying drive voltages
and the resulting force data is collected by the force sensor
and displacement is recorded using a camera (PixeLINK,
PL-B741F). This test setup is shown in Fig. 5(b).
IV. ACTUATOR SELECTION
The ﬁrst component that should be addressed in optimizing
the HAMR’s powertrain is actuator selection. The actuator
must be able to provide sufﬁcient force to enable the robot
to carry its weight while simultaneously maximizing dis-
placement. The actuators should also have a high energy
density so that their contribution to the robot mass will be
minimal. As discussed in section II, optimal energy density
piezoelectric bimorph cantilevers are selected for our robot.
Three different actuators are built with one (1x in Fig. 7),
two (2x in Fig. 7), and three (3x in Fig. 7) central carbon
ﬁber layers. Central layer thickness is chosen so that we
can explore the tradeoff between force and displacement (a
thicker central layer increases blocked force at the expense of
displacement) without altering the planar geometry. All the
other design parameters are kept constant and their reported
(or designed for geometric parameters) values are given in
Table I. The deﬁnitions of these parameters can be found in
[17].
Actuator force and displacement are calculated using the
laminate plate model in [17]. The actuators are also tested
using the actuator test setup described in section III. The

actuators are driven with a trapezoid signal between the
ground and bias voltage; a square signal would maximize
time-averaged force/displacement however a ramp decreases
the likelihood of damaging actuators by exciting the actuator
resonance. The voltages listed in Fig. 7 are the bias voltage
values. The actuator has maximum deﬂection when the drive
voltage is equal to the ground or the bias voltage, and has
no deﬂection where the drive voltage is half of the bias (see
Fig. 6).

The instantaneous force and displacement during a step
cycle are recorded. The half cycle energy, deﬁned as the
product of blocked force and free displacement, of the
actuator for a given drive voltage is found using the force
and displacement data and this energy is divided by the
actuator’s mass to acquire the energy density for a given
actuator. The result of the experiments and the simulations
are shown in Fig. 7. The simulations are run using the
third column of Table I which are the effective values of
actuator parameters. These values are found by ﬁtting the
simulation results to experiment results using the Nelder-
Mead method [20]. The parameters that are found by ﬁtting
are the Young’s modulus of PZT, PZTd
31
strain coefﬁcient,
PZT plate thickness, actuator length, and actuator nominal
width values. These parameters are chosen since they have
the largest impact on actuator performance and are also most
easily affected by actuator fabrication and handling methods.
The Young’s modulus of PZT and the effective width of the
actuator are found to be lower than reported, which may
be the result of ﬁeld-dependent effects on the modulus and
reduced effective width due to laser cutting, respectively. By
direct measurement, we found that the PZT plates are often
thicker than the reported 127 m, which is reﬂected in our
ﬁts. We also found the effective length to be greater due to
imperfect mechanical grounding of the actuators, resulting
in small displacements at the base, effectively increasing tip
displacement.
The agreement between the model with ﬁtted parameters
and the experiment results are acceptable for design pur-
poses. Even though the actuator with a single carbon ﬁber
layer is optimal for displacement and the actuator with three
carbon ﬁber layers has the largest force output, the actuator
with two central carbon ﬁber layers has the highest energy
density. Therefore, actuators with two central carbon ﬁber
layers are chosen to drive the new transmission of our robot.
V. TRANSMISSION SELECTION
As discussed in section II-B, the powertrain must be able
to apply a force equal to half the body weight during walking,
one-fourth of body weight during standing, and also achieve
a large displacement to overcome obstacles. In order to
test these cases, we constructed four different designs by
changing the two parameters described in section II: the
bias of the transmission and the polyimide layer (Kapton)
thickness. A ﬁfth transmission is also built, by adding the
swing DOF to the fourth design, to test if the addition of
the second DOF to the transmission would change its force
and displacement characteristics. The parameters for these
designs are shown in Table II. The values of these parameters
are chosen for practical reasons: the Kapton thicknesses of
12.5m and 25m are commercially available and the 200
m bias is chosen to match the average deﬂection that the
actuators experience at 250 V , i.e. the neutral position of the
foot for the biased transmission is the same as the lowest
vertical position of the foot that the baseline transmission
reaches.

Experimental blocked force data with zero sag (where
the neutral position of the leg is barely touching the force
sensor) and at different sag amounts (where the leg position
is offset a prescribed sag amount from the surface of the force
sensor) are taken using the experimental setup described in
section III. For the zero sag experiments, drive voltages are
varied from 100 V to 250 V in 50 V increments. The upper
limit of 250 V is chosen to avoid mechanical failure of the
piezoelectric ceramics. A drive voltage of 250 V is used for
varying sag experiments, where the sag amount is varied
from 0 to 3 mm in 1 mm increments. The resulting data is
shown in Fig. 8.

The model described in section II is ﬁtted to these data
points in order to ﬁnd the serial compliance arising from
undesired compliance of the body and transmission and
fabrication errors. The joint stiffness values can be found
using the pseudo rigid body approximation; however such
modeling is sensitive to geometry. Therefore, the joint stiff-
ness values are also found by ﬁtting to account for fabrication
errors. In addition to these parameters, the actual bias amount
experienced by the transmission is also found by this ﬁt
since the prescribed bias amount (200 m) is also affected
by fabrication and assembly imperfections. A simple cost
function of RMS error between the data and simulation is
used and this error is minimized using Nelder-Mead method
to ﬁnd the missing parameter values. The values found by
this ﬁt are shown in table III and the simulation results
using the ﬁtted values are shown in Fig. 8. As expected, the
ﬁtted parameter values suggest that the joint stiffness values
increase with increased Kapton thickness, and the bias values
are close to the designed values.
HAMR-V weighs 10.6 mN, hence the transmissions
should be able to generate 5.3 mN of force during walking.
As can be seen from Fig. 8(a), without sagging, the “base-
line” and “double thick Kapton” designs cannot generate
enough force below 250 V , whereas, the other three designs
can generate enough force for walking at drive voltages
above 150 V . On the other hand, all transmissions can
generate enough force for walking once they sag (Fig. 8(b)).

The free displacement of the legs is also recorded and
compared with the simulations using ﬁtted parameters, as can
be seen in Fig. 9. Both simulations and the experimental data
show that the “biased with double thick Kapton” transmis-
sion design, which is expected to be the stiffest transmission,
has the lowest displacement output whereas the baseline
design, which is the softest, has the highest displacement.

As expected, baseline design has the highest displacement whereas the
“biased with double thick Kapton” has the lowest.
The stiffening of the robot’s transmission causes us to sac-
riﬁce free leg displacement, however the actual vertical leg
displacement experienced during walking is the difference
between sag amount and the free displacement. Therefore, a
transmission that is not sagging is also desirable to increase
vertical leg displacement.
Among these candidates the “biased with double thick
Kapton” design is chosen as the ideal transmission candidate
because its force output is high enough for walking without
sagging (see Fig. 8(a)) and the force output continues to
increase as the sag amount increases (see Fig. 8(b)), which
means it has the highest probability of carrying the greatest
payload. “Biased” design is considered a close second, but is
not chosen due to the decrease of its force output as the robot
sags (see Fig. 8(b)), which implies that it would be harder
for HAMR to recover if it sags for any reason (increased
payload or uneven terrain).
We have also investigated the effect of adding the swing
DOF to the transmission on the force output. A “biased with
double thick Kapton” transmission with both lift and swing
degrees of freedom is built and the same experiments are
repeated. As can be seen from ﬁgures 8 and 9, the addition
of the second DOF causes negligible change.
Besides the walking case, the static case should also be
investigated. We have used our model to simulate the force
response of the transmissions for different leg displacements
where the actuator is not driven. The results of these sim-
ulations are shown in Fig. 10. The simulations suggest that
for the “biased with double thick Kapton” design, the leg
should displace 0.5 mm in order to support one-fourth of the
HAMR’s weight, i.e. it will sag 0.5 mm in static case. This
sag amount would increase to 2 mm for “baseline” design.

VI. FULL BODY EXPERIMENTS
A new version of HAMR, HAMR-V , is built using the
optimal actuator and transmission identiﬁed in sections IV
and V. A picture of the robot is shown in Fig. 11. The new
version is a quadruped, driven with optimal energy density
piezoelectric biomorph cantilever type actuators with two
central carbon ﬁber layers. These actuators are attached to a
ﬁve-bar transmission with double thick Kapton joints (25m
thickness) and a 200 m-bias. The four sides of the robot
body are made of laser-machined [0, 90, 0] precured carbon
ﬁber composite and the top and bottom plates are copper-
clad FR4. The copper on FR4 is etched to create electrical
traces required to run the actuators. The current version is
tethered and driven with a Matlab script running on a PC
connected to an xPC target to generate the drive signals. Its
mass is 1.08 g, making it one of the lightest robots capable
of legged locomotion.
Fig. 11. The new quadruped built with the optimal powertrain described
in sec. V.
In order to test the payload capacity of HAMR-V , we add
weights to the robot and run it at different drive frequencies
2404
while recording its walking speed. The robot does not have
on-board electronics and the Matlab script currently does
not implement any closed-loop control. The results of the
payload tests are shown in Fig. 12.

Fig. 12. Speed vs. frequency data of the quadruped without any payload
and under four different payloads. As expected, the increase in payload
slows the robot down and the robot walks faster as the drive frequency
increases.
The results shown in Fig. 12 suggest a 678 mg maximum
payload capacity for the robot. Even though HAMR-V
carrying 901 mg can move at high frequencies, the observed
motion is more similar to vibrating than walking and does
not have a preferential direction. Hence, the payload capacity
of robot is 678 mg, which is 63% of the robot’s mass.
VII. CONCLUSION
Transmission and actuator selection of HAMR-V , a bioin-
spired quadruped, is described in this work. The actuator
and the transmission are modeled using kinematic and power
balance equations. Four transmission designs and three ac-
tuator designs are presented and improved actuator and
transmission designs for the robot are identiﬁed. These new
designs are used to build HAMR-V which can carry an
additional mass of 678 mg. The addition of swing degree
of freedom is shown to not effect the force output of the
powertrain. Although the required force and displacement
outputs change from robot to robot, we believe the model and
the analysis described in this work can be used for similar
robots that are fabricated using PC-MEMS manufacturing
techniques.
Following this work, locomotion studies on the robot will
be conducted and a fully autonomous version of this robot
will be built using power and control electronics similar to
[9]. A camera, an inertial measurement unit (IMU), and other
sensors will be integrated to control locomotion. Compliant
leg designs for increased robustness and foot attachment
mechanisms for potential climbing applications will also be
investigated.
