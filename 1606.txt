Abstract—The issue of efﬁcient large force and moment
exertion with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is the subject
of this paper. Inspiration is drawn from the vision of UAVs that
are capable of autonomously executing industrial activities, or
effectively reconﬁguring their environment via forceful interac-
tion.Therein,thetechnicalshortcomingsofthepotentialutiliza-
tion of conventional underactuated UAV platform designs are
examined, in terms of operational effectiveness-versus-safety.
The innovative implementation of the direct thrust-vectoring
authority of tiltrotor UAV types for forceful interaction is pro-
posed, and its associated technical contributions are analyzed.
A methodology is developed for controlled forward thrust force
and rotating moment exertion, while ensuring safe operation
nearthehoveringattitudepose.Alargeforce-requiringscenario
is assembled, consisting of a realistically-sized object laid on
solid ground, regarded as a path-hindering obstacle to be
forcefully removed by the UAV via pushing manipulation. To
this purpose, a high-end autonomous tiltrotor UAV is employed
in order to achieve this environment modiﬁcation task, relying
on a properly synthesized control structure.
I. INTRODUCTION
Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have surpassed their
role as aerial observation platforms. As major ﬂight-
worthiness issues are efﬁciently treated [1], numerous novel
applications based on environment interaction are being
addressed, such as perching [2], grasping and carrying of
objects [3–6], cooperative transportation [7] and manip-
ulation [8,9], and inspection/micro-manipulation via con-
tact [10,11]. In this work, the concept of an aerial system
capable of actively modifying its environment is envisioned,
by executing tasks which require the exertion of signiﬁcant
forcesand momentsin non-verticaldirectionswhereinUAVs
are naturally endowed. Such potential tasks are: a) industrial
operationssuchasdrilling,cuttingandgrinding,orb)manip-
ulation of movable objects such as heavy doors or physical
obstacles within constrained spaces in rapid deployment and
autonomous exploration scenarios. Therein, controlled large
pushing or pulling forces are a prerequisite in order to
achieve large-scale environment modiﬁcation.
Within this paper the innovativeexploitation of the direct-
thrust vectoring capability of a tiltrotor UAV is proposed
for addressing such applications. Rotor-tilting is employed
in order to generate large forward-thrusting forces, while the
aerial system safely regulates its attitude at the horizontal
hovering pose. Furthermore, exerted moment control can be

study scenario is analyzed. The system model is presented
in Section III and the control synthesis is elaborated in
Section IV. Finally, Section V presents the results of ex-
perimental studies and Section VI concludes the article.
II. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP
Thispaper’scase-studyisillustratedinFigure2.Itconsists
ofthecustom-developed[12–14]UPATTri-TiltRotor(UPAT-
TTR) platform combined with an active 1-DoF revoluteend-
effector, which is passively compliant and equipped with
tactile switches for contact feedback. The full system state
estimation is performed on-board the UPAT-TTR, enabling
the autonomous execution of the presented scenario.
The environment manipulation objective is the displace-
mentofafreeobject,alongacertainpath.Thisisregardedas
a mockup recreation of a rapid indoor deployment scenario,
with a heavy obstacle on solid ground [15] constraining
the UAV’s navigation. In this context the movable object
is sized at approximately twice the UAV’s own mass, and
the inherent ground stiction requires a signiﬁcant forward-
thrusting force to be exerted by the UAV, without risking
stability and mechanical/structural safety.

B. Force–Moment Exertion Mode
In the Force-Moment Exertion (FME) mode, the UAV is
applyingforcesonto thedocked obstacle viathe end-effector
interface as visualized in Figure 2. The forward thrusting
components of the main rotors are applied longitudinally
in the ?
m
-direction, provided the stable attitude regulation
at {?, ?, ?}?{0, 0, ?
obj
??
m
} is ensured. A friction
force F
fr
appears due to the object-to-ground interface, in
the Stribeck [16] generalized form:
F
fr
=
(

v
(u
obj
), for u
obj
6=0
?F
e
, for u
obj
=0 AND |F

|<F
st
, (5)
where u
obj
the object-to-ground interface relative velocity,
F
e
the externally applied force, F
v
(u
obj
) the viscous friction,
and F
st
the stiction forces. In a realistic scenario, the object’s
mass, its internal structure and COM placement, and the
friction model parameters are uncertain, as even the ground
texturecanlargelyvaryamongareas.Theproposedapproach
for the purposes of this paper is the disjunction of the
problem into two separate objectives: a) attitude regulation
aroundthehoveringposewhiledocked,andb)exertedforce-
moment control for pushing-manipulation.
Concerning the attitude regulation problem, and assuming
a forward-exerted pushing force, the UPAT-TTR is consid-
ered as attached onto the object surface at the virtual contact
point. This is regarded as the new center of rotation, with
respect to which the new moments of inertia are recalcu-
lated. Additive disturbances on the attitude are mechanically
counteracted, as is pointed out in the following analysis.
The attitude control allocation principles are similar to [15],
wherein collective rotor-thrusting is utilized for pitch ?-
regulation. Also in [15], it is noted that during docking with
the object no signiﬁcant disturbing moment is producedonto
the UAV, assuming the {?, ?, ?}?{0, 0, ?
obj
} attitude
regulationandthemechanicalplacementoftheend-effector’s
centroid in-line with the vehicle’s COM (r
m
=

r
m
x
, 0, 0

),
as depicted in Figure2.
Concerning the pushing-manipulation problem, it is as-
sumed that the object COM can move along the O
x
-axis
and rotate around the O
z
-axis. Thus, LTP-based {x, y}
manipulationcan beachievedby exertinga forwardpushing-
force and a rotating moment. Forward thrust-vectoring is
employed to generate a controlled longitudinal force, while
a rotating moment can be derived via either: a) differential
thrust vectoring, or b) active end-effector ?
m
control.

These principles are illustrated in Figure 3: In a) the

C. Technical Discussion on Force Exertion via Rotor–Tilting
As discussed, there exists a range of possible tasks which
require signiﬁcant force exertion in non-vertical directions,
wherein UAVs are inherently endowed. Such a force can be

Fig. 4. Technical Analysis of UAV-based Force Exertion Principles
In Figure 4-a), the underactuated dynamics approach is
depictedwithreferencetotheobject-manipulationcase-study
scenario for consistency. This practice is elaborated in [17],
and is based on the principle of forward-forcegeneration via
pitch ?-rotation of the UAV body in order to longitudinally
project the total thrust vector. The longitudinally exerted
force is F
x
=Fsin(?), where F the total thrust, commanded
as F =

in order to achieve steady-state z-axis and ?
moment equilibrium. For a general end-effector design with
d

6=0, and assuming there is no vertical sliding motion on
the contact interface, moment calculation with respect to the
UAV COM yields:

which for? >?

This effect is intuitively depicted in Figure 4-c, maintaining
consistency with a realistic object-manipulation case-study:
4502
the object moves at u

: F

v
(u

) = F

= Fsin(?),
while suddenly encountering a drastically different-textured
area. Assuming no deformation of the object, a large near-
instantaneous ?F
fr
appears due to the UAV’s velocity near
theinstantofenteringthehigher-frictionregion.Thisappears
as a large disturbingmomentonto the UAV COM, leading to
a ?? disturbance. It is noted that the ???

term reduces a
potentiallydestabilizingeffect,justifying arectangularframe
end-effector design (d
m
z
6= 0). However for ? < ?
m
, the

reduced efﬁciency.
In order to generate large forward-exerted forces via this
(underactuated)approach, the UAV is required to heavily tilt
itsbody.However,for???
m
theeffectsofanydisturbances
on the system’s dynamics become more notable as per
(14), and the system becomes increasingly reliant on the
control authority F in order to handle them. For non-ideal,
bandwidth-limited actuation and considering the rigid-body
dynamics coupling, the control authority is limited to a
certain dynamicand static margin.Eventually,such a system
becomespotentiallymoreunstableasanevenlargerforward-
exerted force is required.
In Figure 4-b), the directly-actuated thrust vectoring dy-
namics approach is illustrated. This practice relies on ?
x
rotor-tilting in order to longitudinally project the UAV’s
propulsion force, while the body pitch is regulated at ??0.
Here (13),(14) hold for ??0, while:

where (16),(17) are for ??0, as contact forces are assumed
to be acting on the end-effector center (the end-effector
is planar to the object surface). These indicate the techni-
cal achievement accomplished by employing the directly-
actuated thrust-vectoring principle: As the forward force
component is generated by an additional control authority,
the body pitch can be regulated near the hovering attitude
pose, which drastically minimizes the effects of any distur-
bances. Moreover, an end-effector conﬁguration of ?
m
6=0,
generates a counteracting moment while ? <?

eliminate the disturbing effect of a ?

Fig. 5. Control Scheme for Force-Moment Exertion with a Rotor-Tilting
UAV in Obstacle Manipulation
tained via simulated studies on a non-linear mathematical
model of the UAV’s rotational and translational dynamics.
For each DoF a control action of the U
FF
vector in (3) is
calculated and allocated to the actuation subsystem based
on (4). The U
0

terms are calculated in a feedforward sense.
The attitude-feedback loops operate at f
?
=100 Hz, and the
translation-feedback loops at f
X
=10 Hz.
B. Force-Moment Exertion Controller
The FME control structure in the object-manipulation
case-study assumes one control subsystem for the rotational
dynamics in docked-contact, and one for the translational
manipulation of the obstacle. As discussed, force exertion
via direct rotor-tilting enables constant operation around
the planar-contact, hovering-attitude pose {?, ?, ?} ?
{0, 0, ?
obj
??
m
}, where the rotational subsystem dynamics
can be considered as decoupled. Thus, an output-feedback
control structure similar to the FF one is retained. Stabi-
lizing gains were obtained via simulated studies on the re-
evaluated constrained non-linear rotational model (with the
rotation axes placed at the virtual contact point). Continuous
adaptation of the feedback gains as functions of the rotor-
tilt angles ?
i
is performed, such that the generated force and
moment components controlling each decoupled rotational
subsystem remain constant for a given state-error vector. It
is noted that the object’s orientation ?
obj
is not measurable
while docked, however the error e
?
=??(?
obj
??
m
) can
be indirectly driven by a logical rule based on the detection
of non-bilateral contact as shown in Figure 3-c:

. (18)
For the manipulation of the object’s translation and rota-
tion, the command U
x
in (11) controls via rotor-tilting the
forward-exerted force, which is responsible for putting the
object in longitudinal motion and is driven by the Euclidian

separate PI (Proportional, Integral) output-feedback loops

The Integral term is implemented in the form of a nonlinear
Rate-Varying Integrator (RVI) [18] for position control of
stick-slip friction systems.

erence signals, as determined by the speciﬁc task objectives,
to the appropriatelyswitched controller.Its operationis sum-

a) The Free-Flight state, where no environment interaction
takes place. The generated reference is either derived from
the object reference docking-point X
o
in order to initiate
interaction, or is such that drives the UAV away from the
object after completion of the manipulation objective. This
state’sactive-conditionguard-setis: (c

ANDc

ANDc

).
b) The Non Stable-Contact state, where at least one tac-
tile switch detects contact, and the UAV is not yet at
PLANAR HOVER. At this state, the minimum contact-
maintaining U
x
min
is applied. This state’s active-condition
guard-set is: (c
1
OR c
2
OR c
3
OR c
4
) AND(PLANAR HOVER).
c) The Stick-Pushing state, where the UAV forward-exerted
force is not sufﬁciently large to break the obstacle-to-ground
interface stiction threshold, and thus u
obj
= 0 from (5).
The reference signal to the rotation P-RVI controller is
disabled, as the object orientation is controlled only dur-
ing longitudinal motion. The active-condition guard-set is:
(c
1
AND c
2
AND c
3
AND c
4
) AND(PLANAR HOVER) AND(u
obj
=0).
d) The Slip-Pushing state, where sliding motion is
in effect. The LTP-based position reference {x
r
, y
r
}
drives the translation and rotation P-RVI controllers,
in order to achieve position setpoint manipulation
of the object. The active-condition guard-set is:
(c
1
AND c
2
AND c
3
AND c
4
) AND(PLANAR HOVER) AND(u
obj
>0).
e) The Unsafe-Operation state. A characteristic case is the
detection of an improper docking point: as the object mass
structure is unknown, it is possible that r
obj
z
is such that a
moment capable of tipping the object over is generated, as
intuitively visualized in Figure 6. Such an active-condition
guard-set would be: (c
2
OR c
4
) AND (c
1
AND c
3
) AND (˙ z > 0),
reﬂecting the loss of contact on the end-effector top and the
altitude rise.
V. EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES
For the experimental validation of the proposed approach
an object of m
obj
?4.34 kg was utilized. A forward-pushing
force up to F
x
? 22 N was successfully exerted from the
tiltrotor UAV in order to overcome stiction and manipulate
the obstacle. It is noted that for this sizing a lift-and-carry
strategy would be impossible, as the total rotor thrust margin
is insufﬁcientto supportthecombinedUAV-and-objectmass.
However, the stiction force threshold is signiﬁcantly lower
andlieswithintheplatform’scapabilities.Theaccompanying
video sequence demonstrates indicative respective results.

Fig. 8. Diagonal Setpoint Manipulation
In Figure 8 diagonal setpoint manipulation is presented,
employing the
˜
U
y
differential-drive and the U
y
end-effector
manipulation principles. In these sequences, the Supervisory
FSM controller maintains the reference signal until the
setpoint y
r
-coordinate has been reached. This provides the
intuitive visualization of the effectiveness of each principle:
Thedifferential-drivemomentcontrolauthorityisinsufﬁcient
for larger required moments, which in the object setpoint
manipulation case-study appears as a large x
r
overshoot.
The utility of direct thrust-vectoringas a technical asset in
applications that require the exertion of large forces is note-
worthy. The UAV manipulates its rotor-tilting authority up
to ?
x
?45
?
. At the same time, contrary to an underactuated
system, it successfully remains near the hovering attitude
pose where operational safety lies at maximum.
VI. CONCLUSIONS
An innovative implementation for the direct thrust-
vectoring actuation authority of tiltrotor UAV types was
presented. Rotor-tilting was employed in order to exert a
large force in the longitudinal direction, while the retained
attitude control authority ensured stable regulation near the
hovering pose. Additionally, two methodologies were devel-
oped in order to enact a rotating moment, relying either on
differential rotor tilting, or a separate active end-effector.
Thisstrategy’sincreasedefﬁciency,in termsofeffectiveness-
versus-operational safety, was analyzed in a dedicated sec-
tion. Finally, the proposed approach was experimentally
validated on a mockup scenario, where an obstacle of twice
the mass of the aerial platform was successfully manipulated
via docked maneuvering while pushing.
