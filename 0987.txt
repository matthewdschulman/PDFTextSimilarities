ConservativeEdgeSparsiÞcationforGraphSLAMNodeRemoval
Nicholas Carlevaris-Bianco and Ryan M. Eustice
AbstractÑThis paper reports on optimization-based methods
for producing a sparse, conservative approximation of the dense
potentials induced by node marginalization in simultaneous
localization and mapping (SLAM) factor graphs. The proposed
methods start with a sparse, but overconÞdent, Chow-Liu tree
approximation of the marginalization potential and then use
optimization-based methods to adjust the approximation so that
it is conservative subject to minimizing the Kullback-Leibler
divergence (KLD) from the true marginalization potential. Re-
sults are presented over multiple real-world SLAM graphs and
show that the proposed methods enforce a conservative approxi-
mation, while achieving low KLD from the true marginalization
potential.
I. INTRODUCTION
Graph-based simultaneous localization and mapping
(SLAM) [1Ð7] has been used to successfully solve many
challenging SLAM problems in robotics. In graph SLAM,
the problem of Þnding the optimal conÞguration of historic
robot poses (and optionally the location of landmarks), is
associated with a Markov random Þeld or factor graph. In
the factor graph representation, variables are represented
by nodes, and measurements between nodes by factors.
Under the assumption of Gaussian measurement noise the
graph represents a least squares optimization problem.
The computational complexity of this problem is dictated
by the density of connectivity within the graph, and by
the number of nodes and factors it contains. Therefore, the
computational complexity of the graphÕs optimization problem
can be reduced by removing nodes (variable marginalization)
and by removing edges from the Markov random Þeld
(sparsiÞcation).
Methods that directly sparsify the graph connectivity in an
information Þltering framework include [8Ð10]. In Thrun et al.
[8], weak links between nodes are removed to enforce spar-
sity. Unfortunately, this removal method causes the resulting
estimate to be overconÞdent (i.e., inconsistent) [11]. In Walter
et al. [9], odometry links are removed in order to enforce
sparsity in feature-based SLAM.
Methods that remove nodes from the graph include [12Ð
16]. True node marginalization induces dense connectivity
between nodes in the elimination clique. In Folkesson and
Christensen [12], and in the dense-exact version of generic
linear constraints (GLCs) presented by Carlevaris-Bianco and

Fig. 1: Method overview. Starting with the original factor graph
(a), the red node is marginalized. This induces a densely connected
factor over the marginalization clique (b). The true uncertainty
ellipses (dashed blue lines) are not affected by marginalization. The
dense marginalization potential is then approximated using a sparse
Chow-Liu tree (c). The uncertainty ellipses after the Chow-Liu tree
approximation (red lines) are overconÞdent (note the yellow regions
that are no longer probabilistically plausible). The sparse Chow-Liu
treeapproximationisadjustedsothatitisconservative(d),modifying
the uncertainty ellipses (green lines).
Eustice [14], a linearized factor exactly reproducing the ef-
fect of marginalization at the given linearization point is
introduced over the elimination clique. Unfortunately, when
removing many nodes, the dense connectivity induced by
true marginalization quickly compounds, causing a loss of
sparsity and greatly increasing the computational complexity
of the graph optimization problem. This quickly outweighs the
computationalbeneÞtsofnoderemoval,makingthesemethods
impractical for many applications.
Kretzschmar and Stachniss [13] propose using a Chow-
Liu tree (CLT) [17] approximation, calculated over the con-
ditional distribution of the elimination clique, to guide sparse
measurement composition in producing new non-linear factors
over the elimination clique. This heuristic approximates true
marginalization while maintaining sparsity. However, because
measurement composition is used to compute the new factors,
the true CLT approximation is not computed. Additionally,
information may be double counted during measurement com-
position, producing an inconsistent estimate [14].
The sparse approximate version of GLC proposed in [14]
addresses these issues using linear factors to accurately imple-
ment the CLT approximation without double counting mea-
surement information. This method was successfully applied
to control the computational complexity in long-term multi-
session SLAM [15].

(e) Final Graph
Fig. 2: Sample factor graph where node x1 is to be removed (a). Here Xm = [x0,x1,x2,x3]. The factors Zm = [z0,z01,z12,z23,z13]
(highlighted in red in (a)) are those included in calculating the target information over the marginalization clique Xt = [x0,x2,x3] (b).
The original distribution associated with the target information, p(x0,x2,x3|Zm), is approximated using the Chow-Liu maximum mutual
information spanning tree as p(x0|Zm)p(x2|x0,Zm)p(x3|x0,Zm) (c). The pairwise potentials are reparameterized with respect to x0 to
avoid linearization in the world-frame (d). New GLC factors are computed and inserted into the graph replacing Zm (highlighted in green
in (e)). Note that node removal only affects the nodes and factors within the Markov blanket of x1 (dashed line). The methods proposed
in this paper modify the CLT step (c) in order to ensure that the approximation is conservative.
The CLT produces an approximation with the lowest
Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) among all tree structures.
Unfortunately, achieving minimum KLD often requires that
the CLT approximation be slightly overconÞdent with re-
spect to the true distribution, as illustrated in Fig. 1(c). In
most SLAM applications, conservative estimates are strongly
preferred to overconÞdent estimates. During map building,
overconÞdence can adversely affect data association, causing
the system to miss valid loop closures. Additionally, when
using the resulting map, overconÞdent estimates can lead to
unsafe path planning and obstacle avoidance [18]. Here, as in
[10] and [16], we deÞne a conservative estimate as one where
the covariance of the sparsiÞed distribution is greater than or
equal to that of the true distribution, i.e.,
÷
?³ ?.
Recently, Vial et al. [10] and Huang et al. [16] have
proposed methods that explicitly ensure conservative approx-
imations during graph sparsiÞcation. In Vial et al. [10], an
optimization-based method is proposed that, given a desired
sparsity pattern, minimizes the KLD between the sparsiÞed
distribution and the true distribution while ensuring that the
sparsiÞed distribution is conservative. This method performs
favorably in comparison with [8] and [9], however, as the
authors of [10] acknowledge, the computational cost of the
optimization grows quickly with the size of the matrix being
sparsiÞed. To avoid this they propose a problem reduction
that allows their method to be applied to a subset of the
graphÕs variables. The problem reduction still involves the
expensive inversion of the block of the information matrix
associated with the entire graph beyond the subproblemÕs
Markov blanket, which will also be intractable for large
graphs.
The method proposed by Huang et al. [16] performs node
marginalization by inducing a densely connected linear factor
as in [12] and dense-exact GLC [14]. To perform edge
sparsiÞcation, the authors formulate an optimization problem
that seeks to minimize the KLD of the approximation while
requiring a conservative estimate and encouraging sparsity
through L
1
regularization. This optimization problem is then
appliedtothelinearizedinformationmatrixassociatedwiththe
entire graph, which limits its applicability to relatively small
problems, and prevents relinearization after sparsiÞcation. Us-
ingL
1
regularization to promote sparsity is appealing because
itdoesnotrequirethesparsitypatterntobespeciÞedÑinstead,
it automatically removes the least important edges. However,
because the sparsity pattern produced is arbitrary, it is unclear
how the resulting information matrix might be decomposed
into a sparse set of factors, which is important if one wishes
to exploit existing graph SLAM solvers such as iSAM [7, 19].
In this paper we explore optimization-based methods for
conservative sparsiÞcation of the dense cliques induced by
node marginalization. The proposed methods are integrated
within the GLC framework proposed in [14] and are designed
to maintain the advantages of sparse-approximate GLC. Our
proposed methods address some of the aforementioned short-
comings of the methods proposed in [10] and [16].
¥ Like [10] and [16] our proposed methods ensure that the
sparse approximation remains conservative while provid-
ing a low KLD from the true distribution.
¥ Our methods produce a new set of factors using only
the current factors as input, and do not require the full
linearized information matrix as input as in [10] and [16].
¥ The computational complexity of our method is depen-
dent only upon the size of the elimination clique, and
not on the size of the graph beyond the clique. We
do not require a large matrix inversion to formulate the
subproblem as in [10], nor do we operate over the entire
graph as in [16].
The remainder of this paper is outlined as follows: In
SectionIIwebrießyreviewtheGLCnoderemovalframework
within which our proposed methods are implemented. The
proposed conservative sparsiÞcation techniques are described
in Section III. In Section IV the proposed methods are eval-
uated over a variety of real-world SLAM datasets. Finally, a
discussion and concluding remarks are provided in Section V
and Section VI.
II. GENERIC LINEAR CONSTRAINT NODE REMOVAL
The conservative sparsiÞcation methods proposed in this
paper are developed within the GLC node removal framework.
Therefore, weÞrst providean overviewof GLC noderemoval.
For a full discussion and derivation we refer the reader to
[14]. Here we focus on the CLT-based sparse-approximate
version of GLC, as the goal of the proposed methods are
to produce a sparse approximation with low KLD, with the
855
additional constraint that the approximation is conservative.
Sparse-approximate GLC node removal, illustrated in Fig. 2,
is performed as follows:
1) The potential induced by marginalization over the elim-
ination clique is computed.
2) The potential is approximated using a Chow-Liu tree.
3) The variables in the CLT potentials are reparameterized
as relative transforms.
4) The CLT potentials are implemented as linear factors,
referred to as generic linear constraints, replacing the
original factors over the elimination clique in the graph.
The methods proposed in this paper modify the CLT step
(step (2), Fig. 2(c)) in order to ensure that the approximation
is conservative.

the potential induced in the graph by marginalization. This
potential is characterized by its information matrix, which we
refer to as the target information, ?
t
. Letting X

nodes in its Markov blanket, and lettingZ


.
From ?
m
we can then compute the desired dense target infor-
mation, ?
t
, by marginalizing out the elimination node using
the standard Schur-complement form [5]. Because marginal-
ization only affects the elimination clique, a factor, or set of
factors, which induces the potential characterized by ?
t
, will
induce the same potential as true node marginalization at the
given linearization point.
It is important to note that the constraints in Z
m
may be
purely relative and/or low-rank (e.g., bearing or range-only)
and,therefore,maynotfullyconstrainp(X

).Asaresult,
?

, and distributions derived from ?

, may be low rank.
As in Vial et al. [10] and Huang et al. [16], we wish
to minimize the KLD of the sparse approximation while
producing a consistent estimate. When the distribution means

However, as previously mentioned, ?
t
will, in general,
be low rank, making the KLD ill deÞned. In [10], a full
rank subproblem is deÞned, but its implementation requires
inverting the information matrix associated with the rest of
the graph beyond the subproblemÕs Markov blanket. In [16],
optimization is performed over the full information matrix,
which will always be full rank for well-posed SLAM graphs.
We know that ?
t
will be a real, symmetric, positive semi-
deÞnite matrix due to the nature of its construction. In general
then, it has an eigen-decomposition given by

This allows us to work with the low-rank target information
and limit the extent of the optimization problem to the elimi-
nation clique. Intuitively, this parameter transformation can be
thought of as using the pseudo-inverse [20] of ?

to compute
the KLD. However, it is important that the transformation

A. Chow-Liu Tree Approximation
The original version of sparse-approximate GLC approx-
imated the marginalization-induced factor using a Chow-Liu
tree. The CLT produces the minimum KLD among all trees by
computing the pairwise mutual information between all nodes,
and building the maximum mutual information spanning tree.
The CLT can be expressed as

where x

is the parent of x

, and for the root of the CLT
p(x

) = p(x

). The information added to the graph by
the CLT approximation can then be written as

, (6)
where each ?
i
is the information associated with one of the
unary or binary factors in the tree, padded with zeros so that
the appropriate dimensions are achieved.
The methods proposed in this paper all start with the CLT
approximation and then use optimization methods to ÒadjustÓ
the approximation to ensure that it is conservative. Intuitively,
this can be thought of as numerically growing the uncertainty
of the CLT so that it is conservative, while minimizing the
additional KLD from the true distribution. Each method will
produce, by construction, an approximation with the same
sparsity pattern as the CLT.

B. Covariance Intersection
As discussed in ¤I, the CLT approximation is often over-
conÞdent in practice. This is due to the fact that the tree
structure is not, in general, capable of capturing the full
correlation structure of the original distribution. The covari-
ance intersection algorithm, proposed in [21], can be used to
consistently merge measurements with unknown correlation
and can be used to weight the CLT factors so that their
sum is conservative. Clearly, we should be able to do better
than covariance intersection because the true correlation in the
original distribution, ?
t
, is known. Covariance intersection,
however, does provide an easy-to-compute lower bound on
the approximation performance to which we can compare
additional methods. Additionally, it provides a strictly-feasible
starting point for more complex optimization problems. The
approximate target information produced by covariance inter-
section is deÞned as a convex combination of the CLT factors,
÷
?

where each w

scales the information added by each factor.

C. Weighted Factors
Because the true distribution is known, we can relax co-
variance intersectionÕs requirement that weights sum to one.
Instead we constrain the weights to be between zero and one,
and add the conservative constraint proposed in [10] and [16].
We refer to this formulation as Òweighted factors,Ó and its
approximate target information is deÞned as

which is again a convex semideÞnite program.
D. Weighted Eigenvalues
Instead of weighting each factor by a single value, Þner
grained control can be achieved by weighting each factor
along its principal axes independently. We refer to this for-
mulation as Òweighted eigenvalues.Ó Each factor has an eigen-
decomposition given by

are noticeably more conservative than the CLT (h).
Notethatthenumberofoptimizationvariableshasincreasedin

a signiÞcant increase in the computational cost.
E. Implementation Considerations
Each of the proposed semideÞnite programs are convex
and can be efÞciently solved using interior point methods
[22Ð24]. Interior point methods require that a strictly-feasible
starting point be found before optimization, i.e., an initial
approximation, where 0 < w
i
< 1, ?i and ?
t
>
÷
?
t
(w).
Covariance intersection with uniform weights provides an
easy-to-compute strictly-feasible starting point, and is used in
all experiments.
For low rank target information, the conservative constraint,
?
t
?
÷
?
t
(w), is semideÞnite and will have at least one zero
eigenvalue, and therefore, no strictly-feasible starting point
exists. Additionally, it prevents the evaluation of the optimiza-
tion problemÕs gradient and Hessian. Instead, the conservative
constraint is implemented as
?
t
+?I³
÷
?
t
(w),
so that a strictly-feasible starting point exists and the gradient
and Hessian can be evaluated. Our experimental evaluation
indicates that the actual value of ? has very little effect on the
results. All experiments are performed with ? = 0.1, though
values 10
?5
² ?² 1 produced nearly equivalent results.
IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
Toevaluatetheproposedmethods,wetesttheirperformance
on a variety of SLAM graphs (summarized in Fig. 3 and
Table I), including:
¥ Two standard 3-degree of freedom (DOF) pose-graphs,
Intel Lab and Killian Court.
¥ The Victoria Park 3-DOF graph with both poses and
landmarks.
¥ Two 6-DOF pose-graphs built using data from a Segway
ground robot equipped with a Velodyne HDL-32E laser
scannerastheprimarysensingmodality,DuderstadtCen-
ter and EECS Building.
¥ A 6-DOF graph produced by a Hovering Autonomous
Underwater Vehicle (HAUV) performing monocular
SLAM for autonomous ship hull inspection [25],
USS Saratoga.
The proposed algorithms were implemented using iSAM
[7, 19, 26] as the underlying optimization engine. For each
graph, the original full graph is Þrst optimized using iSAM.
Then the different node removal algorithms are each used to
remove a set of nodes evenly spaced throughout the trajectory.
Finally, the graphs are again optimized in iSAM.

approximation as proposed in [14] is also evaluated.
The results for each method, in terms of KLD, are shown in

with the CLT, which is not guaranteed to be conservative, but
serves as a baseline as it is the minimum KLD distribution
among all spanning trees. As one would expect, covariance in-
tersection produces a very high KLD because it is excessively
conservative. The weighted factors formulation improves the
KLD signiÞcantly with respect to covariance intersection,
while the weighted eigenvectors formulation improves the
KLD further still.
For the Duderstadt, EECS, and Saratoga graphs the sub-
jective difference in the quality of the estimates is very
small, with weighted factors, weighted eigenvalues, and the
CLT producing visually indistinguishable results, see Fig. 4
top row. For the Intel dataset, and to a lesser extent the
Killian and Victoria datasets, there appears to be more room
for improvement, with a noticeable difference between the
weighted eigenvalues result and the CLT for the Intel graph,
see Fig. 4 bottom row.

Finally, we consider the computational cost of the proposed
methods. A plot showing the node removal time as a function
of the number of variables in the elimination clique is shown
in Fig. 6. The average node removal times for covariance
intersection, weighted factors, weighted eigenvalues and the
CLT were 7, 32, 448, and 5 milliseconds, respectively. Even
though covariance intersection and weighted factors were both
solving optimization problems over the same number of vari-
ables, weighted factors is more expensive. This is due to the
fact that the equally-weighted covariance intersection solution,
used as the initial point for all optimizations, was often
very close to the optimal covariance intersection solution and
therefore,covarianceintersectionconvergedquickly.Weighted
eigenvalues solves a larger optimization problem and therefore
is substantially slower. Still, the weighted eigenvalues formu-
lation will often have signiÞcantly fewer variables than [10]
(which optimizes all non-zero entries in the upper triangle of
the information matrix) and [16] (which optimizes every entry

in the upper triangle of the information matrix) for a given
information matrix size.
We note that the computational cost of the proposed meth-
ods increases quickly with the size of the node removal
cliques. However, as experimentally shown in [15], sparse ap-
proximate node removal maintains small cliques in real-world
SLAM graphs even when removing a very high percentage
of nodes. This, in turn, results in essentially constant node
removal time regardless of the the number of nodes removed
and size of the graph beyond the elimination clique.
V. DISCUSSION
The proposed algorithms are presented in the context of
sparsifying the dense cliques produced by node marginaliza-
tion.However,thesetechniquescouldbeappliedtoportionsof

as their basis. We believe that this is a reasonable starting
point as it is the minimum KLD spanning tree. However,
there is no guarantee that, after using the optimization based
methods to ensure a conservative estimate, the CLTÕs sparsity
pattern remains optimal. Furthermore, other non-tree sparsity
patterns may be of interest. This is one strongly appealing
aspect of the L
1
regularization method proposed in [16] in
that it automatically selects the sparsity pattern.
Finally, there is a trade off between the complexity of the
optimization problem and the accuracy of the approximation
it is able to achieve. Based upon our experimental results, we
feel that the weighted factors formulation provides the best
trade off between KLD and computation time, as weighted
eigenvalues only performs marginally better while being sub-
stantially more computationally expensive.
VI. CONCLUSIONS
This paper explored several optimization-based methods
that can be used to produce a sparse, conservative approxima-
tion of potentials induced by node marginalization in SLAM
graphs. Starting with the sparse, but overconÞdent, CLT ap-
proximation of the marginalization potential, these methods
adjust the CLT approximation so that it is conservative, while
minimizing the KLD from the true marginalization potential.
Usingresultsfrommultiplereal-worldSLAMgraphs,wehave
shown that the algorithm enforces a conservative approxima-
tion, while achieving low KLD.
