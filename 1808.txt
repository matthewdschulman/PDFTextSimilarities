show the growth status of the cells after they have been seeded on a-Si:H 
substrate for 28, 34, 46, 54 and 72 hours, respectively. The figures show 
cells spreading on an a-Si:H substrate along the directions of channels. (e) is 
a cell staining result obtained by using calcein AM/propidium iodide. The 
last figure shows that cells have high viability even after having grown for 
72 h on a-Si:H substrate. Scale bar: 100 ?m.

and 43 hours respectively. Scale bar: 100 ?m. 
B. Mechanical properties 
Cells growing on channels with different widths regulate 
their shapes to adapt the limited adhesion areas. This process 
is regulated by the deformation of the cytoskeleton. Further, 
cytoskeleton plays an essential role in determining cell 
mechanical properties. Cytoskeletal deformation is also 
important in tumor cell migration. To investigate the 
interplay among these physiological issues, we measured the 
stiffness values of MCF-7 cells growing under different 
conditions by means of an AFM. As shown in Fig. 4, there 
are three kind of cells: C_normal cells that spread normally 
which seems quadrate, C_edge cells that grow along the 
edge of a naked a-Si:H area, and C_channel cells that 
migrate along the channels defined by the PEGDA hydrogel 
(these cells have a spindly shape). The typical force curves 
of these three kinds of cells are shown in Fig. 5 with the x 
axis representing the indention depth of a cell under the 
exerted force along the y axis. We used Gaussian fitting to 
calculate the elastic modulus. The final results are shown in 
Fig. 6. Note that the average modulus of cell growth 
normally is 0.3±0.2 kPa, cells growing on the interface of 
hydrogel have stiffness values of 0.4±0.3 kPa, while cells 
spreading on a confined channel have stiffness values of 
2.0±1.0 kPa. The results indicate that cells growing in a 
channel are stiffer than those growing at the edge as well as 
cells spreading normally. Cells growing on the edge are a 
little stiffer than normally growing cells, but the difference is 
not immediately obvious. It is also worth noting that the 
measured cells all have similar spreading areas (420–440 
?m
2
). This means that we can ignore the effect of spread 
area on cell mechanics. This result also suggests that cells 
exhibiting a spindly shape are stiffer. However, cells
generating cytoskeleton deformation adapt to the external 
environment and this deformation can influences their 
shapes and mechanical properties. Comparing these three 
kinds of cells, it seems that both cell shape and their 
surrounding environment have observable effects on their 
stiffness values.

represents cells growing on channels of confined size, “C_edge” represents
cells growing on the edge of a naked a-Si:H area, while “C_normal” means 
cells growing normally on a-Si:H substrate. The inserted figure shows the
Gaussian fitting results used to calculate elastic modulus of cells.

V. CONCLUSION 
This paper has reported on an automatic hydrogel 
modification method capable of patterning cells into desired 
shapes. In comparison to existing methods, the proposed 
technique is easier, faster and cheaper. Furthermore, it has 
the ability to change the cell patterns dynamically by 
projecting a light, without the need for a physical mask. The 
effects on cell mechanical property due to cell interaction or 
shapes of cell can be easily investigated by the proposed 
method. Utilizing this technique, a cell-passive hydrogel can 
be modified on a-Si:H substrate and used to control the cell 
shape and status. In our work, the method was tested in the 
context of tumor cell migration. AFM was used to

characterize the elastic modulus of the tumor cells in 
different shape and different migration process. The results 
showed that the cells underwent cytoskeletal deformation so 
as to adapt to the external environment and that this 
deformation had affected their mechanical properties. This 
conclusion is consistent with previous findings that both cell 
external environment and spreading area are capable of  
regulating cell stiffness [6]. The technique proposed in this 
paper can be used to control a single cell’s shape by 
confining their growth in predefined patterns. This is useful 
in studying the independent effect of cell shape on cell 
stiffness. For example, cells growing on narrow channels 
with small adhesion area stretch their bodies as much as 
possible along the channel direction. As a result, the cell 
body gets attached to the area and generates large traction 
forces to balance itself, while a larger traction force can 
increase cell stiffness [5, 7]. In short, the proposed method 
provides a versatile tool for cell patterning, which, in turn, 
makes it applied in a straightforward manner for cell 
mechanical study.
