Robots

AbstractÑ This research aims to create a framework of
transporting an object by multiple humanoid robots. In this
work, a symmetric hybrid position/force control is adapted to
two humanoid robots. The reference object position and attitude
are given by an operator online, and the two humanoid robots
generate its whole body motion to follow the reference object
position properly. The result of proposed method is veriÞed
with a dynamics simulation.
I. INTRODUCTION
Among all types of robots, humanoid robots have the
potential to handle multiple tasks and walk on uneven terrain,
like human beings. Hence, it is considered that humanoid
robots might be possible to work instead of humans at
dangerous zones such as plant facilities.
However, there is a limitation of actuator output, so
the humanoid robots are unable to perform dexterously
and effectively as human beings. Although robots could be
enforced by attaching more powerful motors, the output of
motors is proportional to the size and weight of motors and
there is a load capacity limit in robots meanwhile. Therefore,
multiple humanoid robots working cooperatively will be a
solution to exploit the capability of robots, and which enables
robots to carry a heavy object, or bend a tough object
together.
The style of cooperation of multiple robots can be classi-
Þed into two types generally:
(I) Leader-follower type: one robot recognizes its po-
sition, makes moving plan itself or is operated
directly by a human operator, which is called leader
robot. Then the other robots, which are called
follower robots, just follow the leader robot [1].
(II) Symmetry type: there is no apparent leader robot,
and a central controller controls all the robot in the
same time [2]. The central controller requires all
information of the controlled robots.
In type (I), the force-controlled follower robots follow
the position-controlled leader robot. The impedance of the
follower robots has to be small to strictly follow the motion
of the leader robot. Hence disturbance from environments
may seriously affect on the stability of the robots. Moreover,
the follower robot starts planning after the leader robot moves
as illustrated in Fig. 1 (a). This time-lag may cause low

Fig. 1. Conceptual difference of the two types of cooperation
responsibility and an unexpected falling down. In type (II),
the reference object position is equally used for controlling
the robots by a central controller. Furthermore, the two robots
synchronously move and stop as illustrated in Fig. 1 (b).
This synchronously movement achieves high responsibility
and robustness in carrying an object.
For those reasons, the symmetry type is studied in this
research for cooperation between two humanoid robots.
Uchiyama and Dauchez proposed a central control law
for controlling two robot arms without distinguishing master
and slave [2]. But the redundancy of internal force is un-
considered if there are more than two arms. This control
law is extended to Þt controlling of four robot arms in
this research. There are some ongoing researches about
cooperation transportation by robots [1][3], but most of
them focus on wheeled robots. However, a humanoid robot
uses discrete foot placement while moving which makes
it more difÞcult to accelerate or decelerate suddenly. Also,
internal force between the robots may result in falling down
because the stability margin (e.g. margin of zero moment
point from the fringe of the support polygon) of a moving
humanoid robot maybe not always big enough. Also there
is a research studies in cooperative object transportation
between a humanoid robot and a human [4]. But it turns
out that the human adjusts himself to Þt the humanoid
robotÕs movement. As a result, to achieve cooperative object
transportation by humanoid robots is more difÞcult than by
wheeled robots, and has not been realized yet.

Fig. 2. Scheme of this framework
This research aims to create a framework of cooperative
object transportation for humanoid robots. The scheme of the
framework is shown in Fig. 2. At Þrst, each robot records
the relative displacement from the center of the grasped
object to their foot position in x-y plane (d1Ðd4). The relative
displacement is set as constant, and the reference footprint
position is calculated with this constants from the object
position. Next, an operator gives a reference velocity of the
grasped object. The object reference position is calculated by
integrating the reference velocity, and the robot arms move
the object to follow the reference trajectory. The reference
footprint positions are continuously calculated while the
object is moving. When the error between the current and
reference footprint position exceeds a speciÞed threshold the
robots start to walk. After a few walks, the robots will stop
if the error is under the threshold. The center of the grasped
object is always controlled by hybrid position/force control
law in order to keep the previously speciÞed internal force
between the two robots while moving.
II. WORKSPACE VECTORS DESCRIBING COORDINATED
TASKS
In this research, the extended hybrid position/force con-
troller is derived based on the kinematics and the statics
of the four arms. In this section, the kinematic and static
equations are derived using the task vectors proposed in [2],
which involves generalized forces, velocities and positions.

Fig. 3. A quad-arm manipulator holding a single object
Let us consider four arms holding an object as shown in
Fig. 3. Œ
o
, Œ
hi
and Œ
a
represent the base frame, hand frame
of arm i, and the object frame, respectively. The object frame
is Þxed to the object. The virtual sticks
o
l
hi
(i = 1? 4)
are determined at the moment the robots hold the object as
vectors from O
i
to O
a
. The virtual sticks is Þxed to the hand
frame Œ
hi
. Let h1 and h2 be two arms of one robot, while
h3 and h4 be two arms of the other one. The deformation
of the object and the slippage of the hands on object are
assumed to be very small in this research, i.e. the relative
position between the object center and the grasping points
are constants. And in practical use, the relative position and
posture information of the two robots can be computed from
their joint angle information.

of W is 18Ðdimension. i.e. the outer force/moment acts on
the object is 6Ðdimension, and the internal force/moment
, which is independent from the movement of the object,
is 18Ðdimension. Since the null space is 18Ðdimension, we
can make 18Ðdimensional vector space corresponding to the
null space by choosing a proper vector set of 18Ðdimension,

which is orthogonal to each other. The vector space is chosen

o

o

they can be controlled by giving the reference values for
them. In the case of cooperation between two robots,
o

while

between two arms of each robot.

Finally, we deÞne a Jacobian matrix J

III. WALKING PATTERN GENERATION
A ßow chart of walking planning is shown in Fig. 4. The
two robots generate their own reference zero moment point
(ZMP) and reference center of mass (CoM) trajectory, and
hence the walking plan of two robots are independent. At
Þrst, the robots are in waiting condition. If the error between
the reference footprint position and current position exceeds
the previously speciÞed threshold, the robot starts to take its
Þrst step. The error includes position error e
p
and attitude
error in yaw direction e
A
, which are deÞned as:
e

where d

is the reference yaw angle of the foot, and
y

is the current yaw angle of the foot, respectively. e

the error will be checked again and the robot decides if it
should stop or take a next step. Finally, the robot will stop
walking when the error is under the threshold in which the
arms can move the object to the desired position without
stepping. The reference footprint position is calculated to
meet the initial relative position from the object center to
the footprint position as shown in Fig. 2. Once the reference
footprint position is decided, the reference ZMP trajectory
can be calculated by interpolating the discrete footprint
positions (Fig. 5).
Then the reference trajectory of CoM that corresponds
desired ZMP can be computed by applying the preview
control of ZMP [5].

control and force control.

The reference trajectory of CoM and swinging foot can be
calculated in the way described in chapter III. The reference
attitude of the waist link is given so that the upper body
maintains the upright posture, and the reference yaw angle
is calculated as the mean-value of the supporting foot and
swing foot. The reference object position

the four virtual sticks may cause internal force, the reference
