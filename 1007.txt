AbstractÑ Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) gather
large volumes of visual imagery, which can help monitor
marine ecosystems and plan future surveys. One key task in
marine ecology is benthic habitat mapping, the classiÞcation of
large regions of the ocean ßoor into broad habitat categories.
Since visual data only covers a small fraction of the ocean
ßoor, traditional habitat mapping is performed using shipborne
acoustic multi-beam data, with visual data as ground truth.
However, given the high resolution and rich textural cues in
visual data, an ideal approach should explicitly utilise visual
features in the classiÞcation process. To this end, we propose
a multimodal model which utilises visual data and shipborne
multi-beam bathymetry to perform both classiÞcation and
sampling tasks. Our algorithm learns the relationship between
both modalities, but is also effective when visual data is missing.
Our results suggest that by performing multimodal learning,
classiÞcation performance is improved in scenarios where visual
data is unavailable, such as the habitat mapping scenario.
We also demonstrate empirically that the model is able to
perform generative tasks, producing plausible samples from
the underlying data-generating distribution.
I. INTRODUCTION
Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) are often de-
ployed to obtain imagery of the sea ßoor through optical
sensing [1][2]. These vehicles gather large volumes of image
data to facilitate the monitoring of marine ecosystems. An
important task in marine ecology is benthic habitat mapping,
which involves classifying large regions of the sea ßoor into
broad habitat categories (such as sand, reef, etc) [2].
These benthic habitats are primarily determined by the
substrate (such as rock or sediment) and the organisms
present (such as algae or coral) [3], making them relatively
easy to distinguish using AUV image data [4]. However,
AUVs can only traverse a small fraction of a larger area of in-
terest, limiting the scale to which visual habitat classiÞcation
can be performed. Conversely, bathymetric (ocean depth)
data from shipborne multi-beam sonar is usually available
a priori over an entire site, but has a low spatial resolution
(1:6 m between adjacent points for the dataset used in this
work).

Existing solutions to benthic habitat mapping tend to
consider labelled visual data as ground truth for classiÞcation
of acoustic data [5]. The use of visual data is purely discrim-
inative, and so we propose learning a generative probabilistic
relationship between the visual and bathymetric features.
Such a model could aid planning of future surveys, by
answering multimodal and unimodal queries such as ÒWhere
are we likely to Þnd algae?Ó or ÒWhat kinds of bathymetric
features will we see in conjunction with this image?Ó.
To this end, we propose a multimodal learning approach
based on denoising autoencoders [6] that is able to Þnd
correlations between bathymetry and visual features. Our
method can naturally deal with missing modalities, allowing
it to use visual features in the learning process even when
applied to large benthic regions where only bathymetry is
available. Further, the method can handle both discriminative
and generative tasks, allowing it to perform benthic classiÞ-
cation as well as sample from the underlying data-generating
distribution. In particular, performance is improved on a
bathymetry-based classiÞer by performing multimodal learn-
ing before classiÞcation.
The rest of this paper is organised as follows: Section II
assesses related work in benthic classiÞcation and learning;
Sections III and IV provide some background and outline our
proposed approach; Section V describes the datasets used in
our experiments; and Sections VI and VII detail our results
and conclusions from this research.
II. RELATED WORK
A. Benthic ClassiÞcation
A number of existing methods address the problem of
assigning benthic habitat labels to visual imagery, by per-
forming supervised classiÞcation of coral reef survey images
[7] [8], or clustering benthic imagery in an unsupervised
fashion [9]. However, these approaches are constrained
to previously imaged areas, precluding large-scale habitat
mapping. As a result, many approaches to benthic habitat
mapping are bathymetry-based, using in-situ visual imagery
as Òground truthÓ [5]. One such technique clusters AUV-
based benthic imagery, and uses the probabilistic output as
training labels for classiÞcation of bathymetric features [10].
Another method extrapolates vision-based results to larger
regions, using visual classiÞcation from a completed dive
to determine the most informative future dive from a set of
candidates [11]. Building on these techniques, our approach
looks to incorporate both bathymetric and visual features into

the classiÞcation process, whilst maintaining the ability to
classify either modality on its own.
B. Feature Learning and Multimodal Learning
Feature learning refers to a family of learning techniques
that attempt to determine a set of basis vectors or features
to describe a dataset, often with a sparse representation.
Different algorithms can perform feature learning in practice,
including sparse autoencoders (SAEs), k-means clustering,
Gaussian mixture models and restricted Boltzmann machines
(RBMs) [12]. These methods all tend to learn similar dictio-
naries of localised Þlters [12], such as Gabor-like edge Þlters
for natural images, or handwriting ÒstrokesÓ for the MNIST
digits dataset. While RBMs are generative models that can
sample from the data-generating distribution [13], SAEs are
trained to optimise their reconstruction of the input data.
Deep learning approaches stack multiple feature learning
layers into a single model, and can learn entire hierarchies of
Þlters. Each layer of a deep network usually learns a set of
features at a different scale or complexity, such as an edge,
object-part, or whole object [14].
Deep networks have previously been applied to multi-
modal learning tasks, since multiple layers can capture higher
order correlations between two data modalities. Ngiam et al.
[15] use a deep learning approach to perform classiÞcation
of phonemes from audio and video features. However, their
network is tuned as a sparse autoencoder, which has been
shown to perform poorly in generative tasks [6]. Another
technique learns correlations between a large set of images
and a set of keywords [16] using a deep RBM. By main-
taining the generative properties of the RBM, they are able
to sample keywords given an input image and vice versa.
Another approach uses a Bayesian co-clustering algorithm to
learn a relationship between a visual dictionary and textual
words, in order to perform classiÞcation and keyword-based
image retrieval tasks [17].
C. Our contributions
Building on these methods, we advocate the use of de-
noising autoencoders (DAEs) for multimodal learning tasks.
DAEs are trained to reconstruct the clean input after a
corruption is applied, motivated by the fact that learned
features should be invariant to minor changes in the input
data [6]. By applying masking noise stochastically to a
fraction of the inputs, the training process naturally mimics
the scenario where some modalities are missing, making
them well equipped to handle multimodal learning tasks.
Further, our application demands strong performance in
both discriminative and generative tasks (classiÞcation and
sampling, respectively). DAEs, unlike SAEs, can be used as
generative models and can sample from the data-generating
distribution [6].
We validate our method with both classiÞcation and sam-
pling results, demonstrating its efÞcacy as a multimodal in-
ference engine for visual and bathymetric data. In particular,
we demonstrate that classiÞcation of bathymetric features is
improved by learning multimodal correlations with visual
data, and also demonstrate the ability of the model to sample
from the underlying data distribution.
III. BACKGROUND
A. Autoencoder
An autoencoder is a single layer neural network in which
the hidden layer learns to reconstruct the input. The input
x 2 [0;1]
d
is encoded to a hidden layer representation
y 2 [0;1]
m
according to y = sigm(Wx+b), and the
output reconstruction z 2 [0;1]
d
is decoded with z =
sigm(W
0
y+b
0
). Here, d and m are the dimensions of
the input and hidden representation, sigm(x) =
1
1+e
 x
is
the element-wise logistic sigmoid function, W and W
0
are
weight matrices, and b and b
0
are bias vectors. In the case
of real-valued data x2R
d
, a linear decoder z =W
0
y+b
0
is usually used for the reconstruction. The model parameters
are often further constrained by using tied weights, W
0
=
W
>
[12]. We adopt this constraint for our approach, since
it acts as a regulariser and affords additional ßexibility in the
model (e.g. the option to Þne tune the model as a RBM).
Given a training set of n input data vectors, each training
vector x
(i)
can be mapped to a hidden representation y
(i)
,
followed by reconstruction z
(i)
. The model parameters  =
fW;b;b
0
g are then tuned to minimise a loss function,
often the mean squared reconstruction error over the training
set. To prevent the weights from increasing unboundedly,
we add an L
2
weight decay term, using the square of the
Frobenius norm of weight matrix W. Further, past work
has empirically shown that hidden units that are selectively
activated are more useful in discriminative tasks [12]. Thus,
we also incorporate a sparsity cost, based on the cross
entropy between the sparsity (average activation) of each
unit, ^ 

Here,  and  are hyperparameters to tune the effects of

Typically, the parameters are learned using stochastic
gradient descent or another gradient-based optimisation pro-
cedure. As a result, the autoencoder learns a hidden layer
representation to minimise the mean squared error between
the input and the model-based reconstruction.
Multiple layers of autoencoders can be stacked on top
of one another in order to learn higher order relationships
between features, forming a deep network. This type of
network is learned using greedy layerwise training: training
each layer, encoding the input features according to the
learned parameters, and using these as input for the next
layer.

B. Denoising Autoencoder
In a denoising autoencoder (DAE), a stochastic corruption
is applied to each data vector x
(i)
during training, and
the resulting vector ~ x
(i)
is used as the training input. By
comparing the model reconstruction with the clean input,
the DAE learns to reconstruct input data with robustness to
corruption / noise.
Typical options for the stochastic corruption include ad-
ditive isotropic Gaussian noise, salt-and-pepper noise and
masking noise. Since our application demands robustness to
missing modalities / inputs, we apply masking noise to the
input vectors, where a fraction of the input dimensions are
set to zero. The corruption process is stochastic, so different
dimensions are masked for each training vector and for each
iteration of learning. However, after training the model, the
hidden representation is obtained using clean inputs, so that
future tasks with the encoded features are not probabilistic.
IV. MULTIMODAL LEARNING
A. Notation
Our method utilises square patches of gridded bathymetry
and AUV-based visual images. A bathymetry patchB can be
considered as the sum of a mean ocean depthB
0
= mean(B),
and a zero-mean patch capturing the local bathymetric vari-
ation (or ÒshapeÓ), B
l
= B B
0
. The local variation is
important in determining the habitat; for example, sandy
regions are likely to exhibit smoother bathymetry gradients
than reef habitats. Similarly, the depth is also signiÞcant
(for example, kelp species prefer shallower water). However,
since the depth has a much larger magnitude than the local
variation, it is likely to dominate the feature representation if
B is used directly. We solve this problem by separating the
bathymetry data into these two variables. For the remainder
of this paper, we refer to the mean ocean depth asB
0
, the
zero-meaned local bathymetry patch asB
l
, and the visual
input asV.
B. Multimodal Architecture
Our proposed architecture learns multimodal correlations
using a multi-layer hierarchy. As shown in Fig. 1, the features
forB
0
,B
l
, andV are concatenated in the mid-layer. We then
learn a DAE multimodal layer using the mid-layer as input,
which learns correlations between the modalities and learns
to reconstruct the whole mid-layer input even when large
amounts ( 50% of the input dimensions) are missing.
The mid-layer feature representation ofB
l
is obtained by
learning a DAE on the local bathymetry patches with 25%
random masking noise and a prescribed sparsity of 0:05.
Conversely, the raw depthB
0
is fed directly into the mid-
layer, and image-level features are used for the visual data.
We can justify this architecture by considering the kinds of
correlations that are likely to occur between these modalities.
The ocean depth is unlikely to correlate withB
l
patch pixels
directly, but may be related to the Þrst layerB
l
features (local
edge and gradient Þlters). For example, in the datasets used
for this work, deeper areas often have smoother bathymetry
gradients corresponding to sand habitats, while shallower

reef regions exhibit localised Ôblob-likeÕ bathymetry. Sim-
ilarly, the local bathymetry is more likely to correlate with
image-level features than individual image pixels or sub-
image patches.
Since the mid-layerB
l
features are the output of a DAE
encoding (a sparse code in the interval [0;1]), we use a
modiÞed 1-of-k encoding forB
0
. This is necessary because
it is difÞcult for the multimodal layer to learn correlations
between two modalities with different input ranges. In partic-
ular, we divide the observed depth range of 19 100 m into
82 equally spaced bins with an increment of 1m, and encode
eachB
0
as a value of 1 in the corresponding bin. To ensure
that adjacent bins are correlated (i.e. to explicitly encode
the continuous nature of the depth data) the value of nearby
bins are set based on a Gaussian-like falloff. The width of
this falloff is selected so that the sparsity of the encodedB
0
features is approximately the same as that of the mid-layer
B
l
features. Outside this width, all other values are zero.
The mid-layer features for V are obtained using the
method outlined in [4], based on the Sparse coding Spa-
tial Pyramid Matching (ScSPM) algorithm [18]. A grid of
overlapping square patches are extracted from an image and
each encoded with a SIFT descriptor. These are converted to
a sparse code (using a prelearned dictionary), pooled over the
entire image using a spatial pyramid, and then compressed
using Random Projections [4]. The output of the Random
Projections step results in a 3000-dimensional dense feature
vector, and we need to ensure the mid-layer features have a
similar sparsity across all modalities. Thus, we train another
DAE on these features, and use the encoded representation
as the mid-layer visual features. This ensures that the visual
features do not dominate the representation in the multimodal
layer.
C. Implementation Details
We perform contrast normalisation on the zero-mean
bathymetric patches B
l
when training the Þrst layer, to
ensure that our learned bases cover a larger region of the
input space [12]. We also perform ZCA whitening [12] on
the bathymetric patches to remove redundancy and pixel-
wise correlations, reducing the patches to 104 dimensions to
preserve 95% of the variance.

sand, screw shells / rubble, reef / sand interface, reef and Ecklonia Radiata (kelp). A number of data samples are shown in each row, comprising an
image obtained from the AUV (left) with the corresponding patch from gridded bathymetry data (right). The images are 13601024 pixels and are taken
1:5 3:5 m above the ocean ßoor, while the 1515 bathymetric patches cover a 22:422:4 m
2
area. In the bathymetric patches, red regions represent
shallow waters relative to blue regions.
The DAEs for B
l
and V contain 1000 hidden units,
while the multimodal DAE contains2000. Experiments were
performed with 100, 200, 500, 1000, 2000 and 4000 hidden
units, but the selected numbers exhibited the best perfor-
mance in unsupervised learning and discriminative training.
D. ClassiÞcation and Habitat Mapping
To perform benthic classiÞcation withB
0
,B
l
, andV all
available, we can encode the mid-layer representation using
the multimodal layer, and pass these Òmultimodal encodedÓ
features into a logistic regression classiÞer. When modalities
are missing (such as for benthic habitat mapping), we simply
set the missing input dimensions to zero in the mid-layer
before performing the multimodal encoding. Given that the
DAE learns features robust to masking noise, we expect that
this procedure will yield better results than if we were to
perform classiÞcation on the mid-layer features directly. This
is conÞrmed in our results in Section VI.
E. Sampling
Unlike the standard sparse autoencoder, the denoising
autoencoder can produce plausible samples from the data-
generating distribution [6]. However, contrary to RBMs,
DAEs lack a model of the marginal distribution of the
hidden layer [19] and cannot generate samples from an
arbitrary hidden layer representation. Vincent [19] proposes
that this marginal distribution be modelled as an empirical
distribution, comprised of the set of hidden codes obtained
by encoding the training vectors. Using the example of a
single layer DAE, a sample can be obtained as follows.
First, we encode a training sample to obtain the hidden layer
representation. Then, we perform Bernoulli sampling, where
the value of each unit acts as the probability of activation
of the unit (as with an RBM), resulting in a binary code.
Finally, deterministic decoding yields a new input sample.
For our network, we adopt the same procedure for the
DAE layers, comprised of a deterministic bottom-up pass,
followed by alternating Bernoulli sampling and deterministic
decoding. Missing modalities are again handled by masking
the corresponding dimensions in the mid-layer. Note that
since the ScSPM approach cannot perform top-down decod-
ing (due to the pooling layers), we cannot sample visual
features below the image level.
One speciÞc task of interest is to sample depth / bathy-
metric features conditioned on an input image; i.e. the
query ÒGiven this image, what kinds of bathymetric features
might be present?Ó. To handle this task, we use the same
sampling procedure but instead clamp the visual features at
the observed values (i.e. the evidence) on each iteration.
V. DATASETS
The bathymetric patches were obtained from large-scale
gridded data from Geoscience Australia [20]. The visual
ScSPM features were computed from 1360 1024 pixel
images taken during 14 dives by our AUV Sirius in 2008
off the Eastern coast of Tasmania, Australia [2].
The DAE layer forB
l
was trained using a set of 500;000
1515 patches extracted randomly from the gridded data.
With a separation of 1:6 m between grid points, they each
represent an area of 22:4 22:4 m
2
. The selected size
of this region was based on two considerations: it had
to be sufÞciently large to capture enough texture in the
bathymetry, and sufÞciently small to avoid covering many
different habitat classes. We note that the approach outlined
in [10] uses multi-scale features up to a 5050 m
2
area.
Matched multimodal data was obtained by extracting a
bathymetry patch centred at the AUV position corresponding
to each image. The AUV navigation accuracy is comparable
to the bathymetric grid spacing, and the habitats of interest
typically vary at much larger scales. We therefore assume
that any potential misregistration between the images and
bathymetry (from localisation errors) will have a minimal
effect on the relationship between the two modalities.
The expert labels for the AUV image data were con-
solidated into 5 habitat classes, characterised by keywords
ÒsandÓ, Òscrew shells / rubbleÓ, Òreef / sand interfaceÓ,
ÒreefÓ, and ÒkelpÓ (Ecklonia Radiata). Examples of the
images and bathymetric patches corresponding to each class
are shown in Fig. 2. The labelled dataset contained 68;700
image / bathymetric pairs, split equally into a training and
3822
test set. For the habitat mapping and sampling results, we
use a subset of this data, corresponding to an area of interest
known as OÕHara Bluff.
VI. RESULTS
The learned bathymetric features are shown in Fig. 3.
Interestingly, the DAE learns edge and gradient Þlters similar
to those obtained from natural image patches [12][14].

A. ClassiÞcation Performance
For the discriminative training, a regularised logistic re-
gression classiÞer was used, with a ÒOne-vs-AllÓ scheme for
multi-class classiÞcation. For each classiÞcation scenario, a
3-fold cross validation was performed on the training set
for various values of the regularisation hyperparameter. The
value that maximised the validation accuracy was then used
to retrain the classiÞer on the entire training set.
To quantify the effect of multimodal learning, two clas-
siÞcation scenarios are presented. In the standard encoding
scenario, classiÞcation is performed directly on the mid-layer
features with the available modalities. In the multimodal
encoding scenario, the missing modalities are Þlled in with
zeros at the mid-layer, and the entire feature vector is en-
coded by the multimodal layer and passed into the classiÞer.
The multimodal DAE was trained 10 times, and we report the
mean and standard deviations of the subsequent classiÞcation
results. The performance of the algorithm is shown in Table I,
with the classiÞcation accuracy and associated F1-score.
As expected, results are signiÞcantly better when visual
data is present. When comparing the multimodal scenario
with the standard scenario, we observe an improvement
in performance for the scenarios in which visual data is
unavailable. Interestingly, with visual data available, the
performance with multimodal encoding is slightly lower than
with the standard encoding. This may indicate that the visual
features are already fairly precise for this task, and gain little
information by encoding their relationship with bathymetric
features. The most important result is the benthic habitat
mapping case (B
0
andB
l
), where the multimodal approach
yields a 10% improvement in accuracy. This suggests that
the discriminative power of bathymetric data is improved by
transformation to a feature space which encodes correlations
with visual imagery.
With this improvement, we are able to more accurately
perform large-scale habitat classiÞcation off the coast of
Tasmania, in an area of interest known as OÕHara Bluff (Fig.
4). The classiÞer used to produce the map was trained on a

from the entire Tasmanian dataset, only the training points

regions represent areas over which bathymetry data was

represent sand, screw shells / rubble, reef / sand interface,
reef, and kelp. The AUV dive trajectory is overlaid on the
habitat map, with the colour at each location representing the
ground truth label for the image obtained at that location. A
bathymetry map is also shown for comparison, with depth
contours plotted.
In general, the habitat map is qualitatively similar to that
produced by Bender et al. [10]. Crucially, however, our
approach also encodes visual feature information into the
classiÞcation process. We can also analyse the individual
class probabilities to gauge the performance of the model
(Fig. 5). As expected, the distribution of kelp correlates
strongly with depth, and is most likely to be observed in
the shallower waters towards the bottom-left (South-west)
corner of the map. Similarly, screw shells / rubble and sand
are more likely to be observed in deeper waters towards the
East, though they are distributed over a larger region.
B. Generative Sampling Performance
The model can also sample from the underlying data-
generating distribution, and we present the results of sam-
plingB
0
andB
l
given an input imageV. Some generated
samples are shown in Fig. 6, with the model using each input
image (top row) to generate samples of encoded depths and
bathmetric patchs, respectively (following rows). Recall that
the depth features are encoded as a 1-of-k with Gaussian
falloff, with 82 bins between the range of 19  100m.
Therefore, the depth ÒsignalÓ should be interpreted as an
activation function, where a high activation value suggests a
higher likelihood of observing that depth.
To quantitatively analyse the results, the model was used
to generate 1000 such samples ofB
0
andB
l
for every image
in the OÕHara Bluff region. The images were then grouped
by class label, and the depth samples averaged over each
class to show the distribution over the entire depth range
(Fig. 7). Additionally, the rugosity, a measure of roughness
or terrain complexity [21], was computed for each generated
bathymetry patch, and the mean and standard deviation over
each class are shown in Table II.

interpreted as an Ôactivation functionÕ over the depth range 19 100m).
The results suggest that the model is learning the underly-
ing data distribution. The sampled bathymetric patches are,
on average, smoother for the sand classes and more rugose
for the reef and kelp images (Table II). Similarly, while the
kelp image activates depth features at the lower (shallow)
end of the range, higher depths are activated for sand and
reef (Fig. 7). We also note that the variation within each class
is indicative of the spatial distribution of the class.
VII. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we have presented a multimodal approach
to perform learning and inference from AUV-based image
data and coarse shipborne bathymetry. Our model learns the
relationship between both modalities, and is able to naturally
deal with missing modalities. As such, the algorithm can

the class of the image used to generate them, and a few key classes are
shown here.

capture the visual features of a region, but can still be applied
to large-scale bathymetry where visual data is unavailable.
Our results show that by learning the multimodal corre-
lations between visual and bathymetric data beforehand, we
can signiÞcantly improve classiÞcation performance when
visual data is unavailable. Results also show that the ap-
proach can act as a model for the underlying data-generating
distribution, generating plausible samples of bathymetric

features given an input image.
Future work will focus on experimental validation across
various other AUV dives, as well as application to other mul-
timodal domains, such as incorporating multi-beam backscat-
ter or hyperspectral imagery. Further, we aim to utilise mul-
timodal inference to perform survey selection and mission
planning.
