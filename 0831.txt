AbstractÑIn this paper, we present an improved RRT-based 
motion planner for autonomous vehicles to effectively navigate 
in cluttered environments with narrow passages. The planner 
first presents X-test that can identify passable narrow passages, 
and then perform an efficient obstacles-based extension 
operation within passable narrow passages. In order to generate 
a smooth trajectory for the vehicle to execute, a post-process 
algorithm with trajectory optimization is proposed. For the 
purpose of demonstrate benefits of our method, the proposed 
motion planner is implemented and tested on a real autonomous 
vehicle in cluttered scenarios with narrow passages. 
Experimental results show that our planner achieves up to 13.8 
times and 7.6 times performance improvements over a basic 
RRT planner and a Bi-RRT planner respectively. Moreover, the 
resulting path of our planner is more smooth and reasonable. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
With the constant pursuit of people for intelligent life, 
autonomous vehicles have become increasingly important 
research topic in various civilian and military operations. A 
fundamental part of the vehicle autonomy consists of motion 
planning and navigation system that enables it to safely drive 
through different types of environment. General motion 
planning methods have been studied in the literatures and it 
plays a vital role in different fields from computer animation, 
artificial intelligent to autonomous systems.  
Intrinsically, a motion planning task can be stated as 
finding a path for a robot, such that the robot can move along 
this path from its initial configuration to goal configuration 
without colliding with any obstacles in the scene. Dijkstra?s 
shortest path algorithm, potential fields and A* algorithm are 
traditional methods for motion planning [1]-[3].  In 2007

DARPA Challenge, a motion planning method based on 
Anytime Dynamic A* algorithm is well applied by CMU team 
[5]. Their approach generates good results in practice for 
urban driving, so that they finally won the competition. 
Sampling-based methods in robotic motion planning 
literatures, such as the Probabilistic RoadMap (PRM) [6] or 
Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRTs) [7], which have 
received a considerable amount of attention in recent, as they 
have been designed and successfully used to motion planning 
in a variety of environments [17]. In 2007 DARPA Urban 
Challenge, a RRT-based motion planner is developed by MIT 
team [8]. This method is not only effective for obstacle 
avoidance, but quickly finds a path to the goal configuration in 
the random steps. Thus, make them successfully complete the 
competition. 
The above mentioned methods are effective for route maps, 
such as urban roads and highways. In cluttered environments 
with narrow passages or complex multi-obstacle environments, 
however, these methods are not suitable for motion planning 
since the limitations of their own. In these environments, 
quality of A* algorithm is largely restricted to the grid 
resolution. In addition, since the number of grid points grows 
exponentially with the dimensionality of the state-space, so 
does the running time of the algorithm. Yet, potential field 
methods easily suffer from local minima [4]. For RRT-based 
planning algorithms, their performance will degrade if the free 
space of the robot has narrow passages. Because of the 
sampling points are less likely to fall into the narrow passage, 
which hinders the tree to grow through the passage. 
Motivations for the work presented here come from 
motion planning for autonomous vehicle in cluttered 
environment with narrow passages. Therefore, we present a 
new Improved RRT-based algorithm (which is abbreviated as 
An Improved RRT-based Motion Planner for Autonomous Vehicle in 
Cluttered Environments

IRRT in the following sections) in this paper, and develop a 
motion planner based on IRRT at the same time. This motion 
planner can efficiently generate a smooth and feasible 
trajectory in cluttered environments with narrow passages or 
complex multi-obstacle environments, and thus successfully 
solve the motion planning problem. 
Specific contributions of this paper include:

passages and estimate the width and depth of the 
difficult regions, which determine whether to meet 
driving requirements of the robot to further increase 
the recognition accuracy.

time.

proposed, which makes the resulting path can be 
directly executed by the vehicles to guarantee the 
integrity and practicality of the planner. 
? We have implemented our motion planner and test the 
real performance of the planner on our autonomous 
vehicle ÒIntelligent Pioneer IIÓ (see Fig.1). In practice, 
our algorithm improves the performance by 13.8 
times and 7.6 times as compared to basic RRT planner 
and Bi-RRT planner respectively. 
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section II, 
we provide a brief survey of related work in sampled-based 
planning. In Section III, we present our improved RRT-based 
algorithm, and post-process algorithm is described in Section 
IV. Experimental results of the motion planner in a real 
autonomous vehicle and comparison with reference methods 
are given in Section V. 
II. RELATED WORK AND PRELIMINARIES 
In this section, we will formulate the motion planning 
problem and then discuss prior work on RRT which 
especially be designed to efficiently handle the complex 
environment with narrow passages. 
A. Motion planning problem formulation 
For clarity, we give some definitions and terms at first. 
For a mobile robot with n degrees of freedom (DOFS), its 
configuration can be represented as a point in an 
n-dimensional space C, called the configuration space. A 
configuration q is free, if the robot placed at q has no collision 
with the obstacles or with itself. We define the free space F to 
be the set of all free configurations in C. The obstacle space B 
is defined to be the complement of F: B=C/F. Let the starting 
configuration be q
start
?F and the goal configuration be q
goal
?F.  Thus, the motion planning problem is to find a path 
connecting q
start
 with q
goal
, that is, a continuous collision-free 
path ¹:[t
0
, t
f
] ?F, such that ¹(t
0
) = q
start
 and ¹(t
f
) = q
goal
 , 
where t
0
 is the starting time and t
f
 is the final time. 
Though the motion planning problem is an interesting 
thing from a practical view, the problem is still known to be 
computationally challenging, especially in complex 
environment. In order to achieve computational efficiency, 
sampling-based approaches have been extensively used. 
Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRTs) have been widely 
applied in single-query problems, while Probabilistic 
RoadMaps (PRMs) are useful for multi-query problems [17]. 
B. RRT and Narrow passages problem 
At first, we give a brief description on RRT algorithm. It 
incrementally searches C from starting configuration q
start 
(the 
root node of search tree) by iteratively selecting a random 
configuration q
rand
 followed by finding q
nearest
 , the nearest 
node in the tree to q
rand
, and steering q
nearest
 towards q
rand
 to 
produce q
new
 which is then added to the tree. More 
specifically, when q
nearest
 is selected, an Extend operation is 
executed on q
nearest
 towards q
rand
 which iteratively takes steps 
based on the environmental resolution, checking validity at 
each step. This continues until either a tolerance distance, the 
B boundary, or q
rand
 is reached. Even though, RRT have 
drawbacks in passing through narrow spaces of the 
environment. 
In fact, if the path to find in C passes through a narrow 
passage, the algorithm has to sample configurations inside the 
small region, impacting the connectivity of F. However, it is 
difficult because the volume of the narrow passage is small 
compared with C.   
In order to efficiently handle this challenge, many 
strategies have been presented to improve the performance of 
RRTs for narrow passages. They include utilizing a 
bidirectional search with two trees (Bi-RRT)[7], using the 
work space obstacle  geometry information to guide the 
sampling (OBRRT) [9], adaptive sampling strategies towards 
more critical regions[10], [11], biasing sampling 
techniques[12],[13], etc. 
Particularly,Retraction-based methods [14],[15],[16],[20], 
[21], have shown great success in handling the environment 
with narrow passages. One approach, is called as Selective 
Retraction-based RRT, filters the use of Retraction-based 
RRT by taking a possibly expensive Bridge-line test, to 
determine whether a node of the tree is within or near a narrow 
passage [16].Our idea is just inspired by it. The biggest 
difference is that our method can not only identify the narrow 
passage, but also can estimate the width and depth of the 
narrow passage which analysis whether it can satisfy the 
conditions of traffic. Moreover, in this special region, we also 
propose a novel and inexpensive extension method to meet the 
requirements of practical application.

III. IMPROVED RRT-BASED ALGORITHM 
In this section, we present our improved RRT-based 
algorithm which is designed for efficiently handling narrow 
passages. 
It is necessary to add some basic constraints, including the 
width and depth of narrow passages, to identify the narrow 
passage, since our intention is for the vehicle motion planning 
in this environment. In order to avoid spending the sampling 
time on those impassable regions, we present a X-test method, 
which is inspired by the bridge line-test [11]. 
A.  Improved RRT-based Extension 
We first explain our extension method of IRRT, whose 
pseudo code is at Algorithm 1. When a random configuration 
q
r
 and its nearest neighbor node q
n
 are computed, we perform 
our extension method, IRRTExtend(q
n
,q
r
), shown in 
Algorithm 1. In the first step, if the line of (q
n
,q
r
) is 
collision-free, the extension method is the same to the 
extension method of the standard RRT explained in Sec. II-B. 
Otherwise, we perform X-test to decide whether a passable 
narrow passage exists. If it indicates that there is one, we find 
the estimated entrance point of the narrow passage. 
Subsequently, we can perform a new extension method in this 
special case. 
B. X-test 
The X-test algorithm not only determines whether a 
passable narrow passage exists, but find out the estimated 
entrance point of the narrow passage. Its pseudo code is 
shown in Algorithm 2. In order to perform the X-test, we first  
 
create a line segment whose one end is located at q
c
 and the 
length is related to the size of robot. Instead of generating the 
line direction in a uniform manner, we consider local 
information around q
c
 to make the line direction to through 
narrow passages with higher probability. Since the line 
segment between q
c
 and q
n
 is collision-free, we can think that 
there are no narrow passages along this direction, which is 
v
1
=(q
n
-q
c
)
 
(see Fig. 2(b)). In like manner, then, the line 
segment between q
c
 and q
r
 is in B, we can also think that there 
are no narrow passages along the direction, which isv
2
=(q
r
-q
c
) 
(see Fig.2(b)). This local information guides us to select a 
random line direction between these two line directions. 
      After constructing a line whose two end points are q
c
 and 
q
e
, we check whether there is a collision at point q
e
. If there is 
a collision, we treat the region around these q
c
 and q
e 
as they 
are in a narrow passage, and thus perform the succeeding 
operation, which will return the estimated entrance point q
d
 of 
the narrow passage or null. When connect the configuration 
q
e
 and the configuration q
r
, we can obtain two obstacle 
boundary points q
m
 and q
f
 . If the line segment between q
m
 and 
q
f
 is collision-free and their length is longer than d
threshold
, 
which is equal to the sum of the width of robot and safety 
distance, we can check the intersecting line L of 
f m
q q
 whether 
there are any collisions in L.   Note that we generate the

identify the narrow passages by performing X-test. Note that (b) also is 
a illustration of X-test method.

direction of line L in a specialized manner, selecting the 
vertical direction in a higher probability. The main aim of 
checking the collisions in such a way is that we can identify a 
passable narrow passage and exclude those fake passages. 
And then we call this X-test, because the line segment 
f m
q q
 
and line L resemble a capital letter X. 
C. Obstacles-based Extension 
Intuitively, if we expand from a configuration in free space, 
we should apply a simple growth method such as randomly 
selecting a direction. However, if we expand within a narrow 
passage, expensive growth method may be more useful. In 
these special regions, then, we can take advantage of the 
information of obstacles to do more efficient extension. 
Therefore, we present a new extension method, 
Obstacles-based Extension (q
d 
, d), shown in Algorithm 3. Our 
method is based on the information of goal configuration and 
the information of obstacles, such that, once a configuration is 
identified in a narrow passage one can perform a extension 
with a fixed length size d. Note that, the newly generated 
configuration must keep a safe distance between it and 
obstacles. The main reason of extending the configuration in 
this way is that it not only meets the constraints of obstacles 
space, but can speed up the progression of our algorithm in 
constrained regions. 
IV. POST-PROCESS ALGORITHM 
It is well known that RRT-based planners often generate 
jerky and unnatural paths that may contain unnecessary turns, 
or that the velocities at the points may change arbitrarily. All 
of these issues are bad for the vehicle to execute. Especially, 
these issues become more significant when the environment 
has narrow passages as the narrow region for path planning 
becomes more constrained [18]. Therefore, a post-process 
algorithm is proposed for generating smooth paths. And this 
algorithm consists of two stages: pruning stage and smoothing 
stage. 
A. Pruning Algorithm 
As mentioned earlier, in order to address the unnecessary 
turning points problem, we introduce our pruning algorithm, 
Pruning (T), shown in Algorithm 4. 
 
In this algorithm, we need to take into account the 
obstacles constraint, which is caused by the change of 
connection of node. Then, we make a detailed introduction of 
our pruning algorithm. 
We can obtain an ordered tree T= {q
0
, q
1
, q
2
, ... , q
N
} (q
0
 is 
the initial node and q
N
 is the goal node) from the 
aforementioned IRRT. In order to discard the unnecessary 
turning nodes, we apply greed strategy in this algorithm. Let  
q
temp
 represents q
0
 and start from q
temp
, we orderly try to 
connect to q
1
, q
2
, ... , q
N
, till the line segment between q
temp
 and 
q
i
 has a collision with obstacles. Then we can replace the 
zigzag path between q
temp
 and q
i-1
 with the straight line. 
Observe from Fig.3 that the unnatural nodes (q
1
, q
2
, q
3
) 
between q
0
 and q
4
 are discarded and the critical nodes are 
retained. Thus the issue of unnatural and unreasonable paths is 
effectively solved. 
B. Path Smoothing 
In this final stage, we need to handle the path from the 
aforementioned operation to generate a smooth and 
continuous-curvature path. By the experiences of experiments, 
we use the method of Bezier Curve to smooth the path because 
it?s inexpensive overheads and well geometric property. 
Bezier Curve is defined as follows: we construct n-stage 
Bezier Curve by n+1 control points P

According to our experimental results (Section V), it can

method of Bezier Curve. 
C. Overall Algorithm 
A pseudo code of the overall algorithm of our IRRT 
planner is shown at Algorithm 5. We generate a random 
sample q
r
 and find out its nearest neighbor node q
n
. Then we 
perform our extension algorithm, IRRTExtend(á ), and update 
the tree T. We iteratively perform these steps until we find a 
collision-free path between the start and goal configurations. 
Finally, we perform the post-process algorithm to obtain a 
smooth path S for the vehicle to execute. 
V. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 
A. Experimental Condition 
We have implemented the motion planner in our 
autonomous vehicle platform, called ÒIntelligent Pioneer 
IIÓ(see Fig. 1). It is equipped with a GPS/INS receiver, three 
LIDAR sensors (two Sick LMS, one Velodyne HDL-64), and 
three cameras [19]. We did some experiments for outdoor 
autonomous traveling through the cluttered environment with 
narrow passages. And we implement our method and 
compare this method with basic RRT and Bi-RRT. Fig. 4(a) 
shows the experiments environment for autonomous driving 
with sizes 3.3 x 45 meters and Fig. 4 (b) depicts the 
corresponding perception map. In Fig. 4 (b), the white area 
indicates safety area and blue area indicates obstacles area or 
infeasible area.  
In the cluttered environment, we set a start point (purple 
point) and a goal point (green point). All algorithms are 
implemented in Visual C++ on an Intel i7 computer that has 
2.53 GHz CPU. 
B. Evaluation Results 
The final paths after optimization and smooth of three 
different methods are shown in Fig.5.  Observe from Fig.5 
that our planner is obviously more reasonable than the other 
two planners, RRT planner and Bi-RRT planner. The

resulting path of our planner (Fig.5 (c)) is almost in the 
middle of the sinuous road. However, the path of RRT 
planner (Fig.5 (a)) is close to the obstacles and the path of 
Bi-RRT planner is much sharper (Fig.5 (b)). Moreover, we 
also compare the relevant characteristics of our planner with 
the other two planners, which is shown in TABLE I. Note that, 
in the third column of Table I, the number of retained nodes 
after pruning is listed in parentheses. And in the fourth 
column, the time cost of according planner expansion is also 
listed in parentheses. As RRT is a randomized algorithm, we 
performed the same experiment 500 times for three different 
methods respectively and compared their average 
characteristics.  Firstly, in the term of success-rate, IRRT 
planner and Bi-RRT planner are all 100%, but the 
success-rate of RRT is only 87%. Secondly, the number of 
nodes of IRRT planner is drastically less than the others. And 
the unnecessary nodes are effectively discarded by Pruning 
Algorithm, the few critical nodes are reserved. From the 
expansion time, our planner shows 13.8 times and 7.6 times 
improvement over RRT planner and Bi-RRT planner 
respectively. 
VI. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE 
In this paper, we present an improved RRT-based motion 
planner to further the overall performance of RRT planners in 
cluttered environment with narrow passages. Our planner can 
identify the passable narrow passages by using X-test, and 
then perform the obstacles-based extension within the 
difficult regions. After finding an original path from start 
point to goal point, we handle the path by post-process 
algorithm to obtain a smooth path. We have implemented this 
method and applied it for a real autonomous vehicle in a 
difficult scenario. Our experimental results show that our 
planner significant speedups over prior RRT planners in 
cluttered environment. 
There are several limitations of our planner. Though our 
method can handle the narrow passages for autonomous 
vehicle, the total computation time can?t well satisfy the 
real-time (Table I). The main reason is that Pruning 
Algorithm of the post-process spends large time on collision 
detection.  Furthermore, to some extent, our method is lack of 
robust due to the interference of environment noises. 
There are many avenues for future research work. We 
would like to take the RRT as a tool of exploring the 
information of space to combine with other intelligent 
algorithms, such as machine learning and neural fuzzy 
network. Moreover, we would like to further enhance the 
robustness of our method. Finally, we also would like to 
apply our X-test method to PRM planners.
