Design and Control of a Low Cost 6 DOF Master Controller
Tian Qiu Student Member IEEE, William R. Hamel Fellow IEEE, Dongjun Lee Member IEEE
AbstractÑ This paper provides the design of a low cost
master controller for teleoperation systems. The system consists
of a center handle and four off the shelf haptic devices. The
control law of the four devices coordinates them to provide six
degree-of-freedom(DOF) force feedback. The relative position
and the dimension of the handle are designed to maximize the
range of motion. The system actuation redundancy problem is
formulated into a standard convex optimization problem and
resolved. The squared sum of the force provided by all the
haptic devices are deÞned as the optimization function and
the desired force and torque feedback is used as the linear
constraints. Experiments in teleoperation and haptics projects
were carried out to verify the theoretical results about system.
I. INTRODUCTION
A haptic device with 6 DOF force feedback is essential
in providing exact and complete kinesthetic feedback. There
are several off-the-shelf haptics device with 6 DOF of force
feedback [1], [2], [3]. Force Dimension offers several haptic
devices with 6 active joints, A product called Òsigma. 7Ó
even has a seventh active grasping joint to mimic the motion
of a pair of scissors[1]. Geomagic provides a haptic device
called ÒPhantom PremiumÓ which can provide a fairly large
workspace and force capacity [3]. Another notable product
called ÒHaptic WandÓ is also available from Quanser, a re-
search equipment company [2]. It offers Þve active degree of
freedom with a sixth passive joint. Typically, these expensive
systems that many researchers cannot afford.
There are two ways of building a 6 DOF haptic device:
1) designing and building the whole system from scratch
[4], [5], [6], [7]; 2) integrating existing off-the-shelf haptics
products with less degrees of freedom, and combining them
to provide a higher degrees of freedom force feedback.
Building an advanced haptic device based on the off-the-
shelf haptic devices can be very cost effective. The Novint
Falcon is developed as a haptics research device and widely
used as a computer gaming input. Many researchers have
integrated multiple Falcons together to develope new haptic
devices with higher degrees of freedom. Instructions about
how to build it is provided in [8]. A device similar to it has
seen application in device calibration for Þngernail imaging
[9].

The Phantom omni, another type of widely used hap-
tic device, can also be integrated to provide advantages
in force/torque feedback for various research. In [10], a
simulation platform for Da Vinci remote surgery system
is developed. Two Omnis equiped with hand grippers are
used as master devices for the Da Vinci system, each of
them controls one slave robot individually, so no kinematic
coupling or force control collaboration is considered. The
Omni and the Falcon have also been used in collaborative
haptic tasks in [11]. The kinematics and dynamics have been
studied in [12], [13].
The challenge of our work is that the system we build has
actuation and kinematic redundancy. All Phantom Omni de-
vices return is end-effector position information. The system
needs to compute the handlesÕ position and orientation based
on this information. The computation includes coordinate
transformation and vector computation. The force feedback
from the devices also needs to be coordinated to ensure
precision while minimizing the total load of the system.
The advantages of our system includes: low cost, effective
force/torque feedback, more degrees of freedom in feedback
and better position resolution. One Phantom Omni costs
$1500. So the total cost of our system is approximately
$15004=$6000. The force feedback provided by the new
system is the summation of four individual Omnis, so the
maximum force feedback is four times the original deviceÕs.
Also, the devices are conÞgured in such a way that torque
feedback can be provided to the operator, which is critical
in many applications. For example, in the case where an
operator is teleoperating a robot with an impact wrench as
its end-effector, the resistive torque provided to the operator
can provide them with ample information.
II. SYSTEM DESIGN AND KINEMATICS
In this section, the general design of the proposed con-
troller is presented. Its mechanism and capacity are dis-
cussed.
A. Mechanism
Four Phantom Omni devices were used in our system as
shown in Fig. 1. All of them were Þxed onto the 80/20
aluminium frame with rods that are not shown in the Þgure.
The rods were threaded and screwed onto the bottom frame.
The original handles on the Omnis were removed. The handle
we built was attached to the end links. The Omnis are
electronically connected in cascade style using Firewire. Two
Omnis are used in each cascade, so there are two cascades
in total. According to the manual, each cascade can have a
maximum of 20 haptic devices, so the amount of devices we

used was far below the capacity and therefore update rate
would not be affected.
B. Range of Motion and Force Capacity
The haptic devices are placed to maximize the range of
motion of the new master controller. The range of motion
of the Phantom Omni is 6.4Ó 4.8Ó 2.8Ó (160 120
70mm) [14]. The deÞnition of the coordinate system for a
Omni is shown in Fig. 3. If the new device travels along the
vertical axis, all the Omnis reach their maximum and mini-
mum Y-axis value simultaneously, so the range of motion in
Y-axis is them same as on the original Omni speciÞcations.
Comprised where there were two Omni devices, P1 and P4,
were placed side ways to the other two. The range of motion
on the horizontal plane is limited by the Z-axis motion of P1
and P4. Therefore, the range of motion of the new system
is smaller than the Phantom Omni: 2.8Õ 4.8Õ 2.8Õ (70
 120 70mm). When in the center of the workspace, the
rotational range of motion of the new system is the same as
the original Phantom Omni. However, it is noted that when
close to the boundary of the workspace, signiÞcant rotational
range of motion was lost.
The maximum exertable force of a Phantom Omni is 0.75
lbf (3.3 N)[14]. The maximum force feedback that can be
offered by the proposed system is the sum of the force
feedback from the four Omnis, and therefore, 3 lbf (13.2
N).
C. Handle
The handle of the new system was designed to connect the
four Omnis together. It has four holes which Þt tightly with
each haptic device. In order to reduce its weight, the handle is
hollow. The light weight is essential to because the gravity of
haptic devices is added on top of the force feedback provided
by the active joints. Any extra weight hampers the kinesthetic
perception. 3-D printing has shown great potential in new
equipment prototyping. It brings great ease to the engineers
Fig. 2: Control System of the novel 6 DOF haptic device
because of the ßexibility of 3-D printing. Parts coming from
3-D print are light weight and comparatively sturdy. The
handle was printed using a Stratsys Fortus 250mc 3D printer.
III. KINEMATICS
The general control architecture of the proposed device is
shown in Fig. 2. The purpose of this section is to present the
solution for the ÒKinematic coordinate transformationÓ and
ÒKinematicÓ block of that Þgure.
A. Kinematics of Phantom Omni
A Phantom Omni haptic device has six joints in all: three
actuated and three passive. The device measures the rotation
angle of each joint and computes the position of the end
link. The origin of the coordinate that is attached to the end
link is where the last and the second-to-last intersects. The
rotational axis of the fourth link also passes through this
point. The joint angles of last three passive joints effect the
end effector orientation but not the position. The position
and conÞguration data acquired from the Omnis are all with
respect to its own world frame.
B. Modelling and Coordinate Transformation
Each Omni can measure the position of its end link with
respect to its own world frame. We use that as the position
of the corner of the handle,O

coordinates corresponds to one Omni in Fig. 1. They needed
to be transformed into the common world frame Þrst.

The position and orientation of the handle with respect to

C. Kinematics
The orientation of the controller is derived using Eqs. 7,
8 and 9. All the position data (p

) are in the common
world coordinate. Therefore, only the position data from each
Omni is used to derive the orientation of the handle.Thus
the singularity problem that usually happens at the last three
passive joints is avoided. Denote:

IV. FORCE FEEDBACK
This section addresses the ÒActuation Redundancy Reso-
lutionÓ in Fig. 2. The actuation redundancy issue is formu-
lated into a convex optimization problem and a solution is
provided.
A. Force Coordinate Transformation
When computing the command force for each device, the
desired force and torque is Þrst represented in the frame
located at the center of the handle, as shown in Fig. 4; the rest
of the coordinates represented the force each Omni exerted
on the handle. The reason why we pick this coordinate frame
is that the leverage for each force exerted on the handle
would be constant based on the chosen coordinate frame.
After the optimization process, the computed force vector
will be transformed into world frames of each haptic device,
respectively.
B. Actuation Redundancy
The four haptic devices have three actuated joints each.
Therefore, there are twelve DOF actuation in the system, but
the force/torque feedback has only 6 degrees of freedom.
This actuation redundancy is formulated as an optimiza-
tion problem. The objective function is the squared sum
of the torque applied on each joint. The justiÞcation of
this is that the torques are proportional to the current for
each motor, and therefore to the power consumption of the
haptic device. Minimizing the sum of the torques is the
same as minimizing the effort of the whole control system
and maximizing the life of the system. The constraint for
this optimization problem is the desired torque and force
feedback to the operator.

The desired force and torque at the new handle are given
by the following equations. The subscripts stand for the index
of haptic devices, the superscripts stand for the axis of the
corresponding device.

Each of the four Phantoms provides 3 DOF force feedback,
so the number of unknowns here is twelve. There are a total
of six constraints on them, from Eq. 10 to Eq. 15. We propose
an optimization function to control this redundant system.
Motors in the haptic devices provide the force feedback,
and forces are proportional to the currents passing through
the motor. In order to minimize the load of the system, we
proposed the following objective function:

we can get Eq. 19, whereJ is shown in Eq. 20. This matrix
is the Jacobian matrix of the system. Since the output of the
Omnis is force and the output of our new system is force and
torque, the Þrst three lines of the matrix have no dimension,
and the remaining three lines have the dimension of length.

After deriving F , all the force components have to be
transformed into the form with respect to the ground frame
of the Omnis.

D. Convex Optimization Methods
Given the objective function in Eq. 16, and linear equal-
ity constraints in Eq. 19, then apply the ÒKarush-Kuhn-

The matrix on the left side of Eq. 22 is invertible by
inspection, so the optimal value can be found by directly
taking the matrix inverse. Since this is a constant matrix,
matrix inversion doesnÕt have to be processed every iteration.
It can be computed ofßine and stored in the computer

V. EXPERIMENTS
A. Teleoperation Experiment
In this experiment, the system we developed is used as
the master robot in a teleoperation system. A Whole Arm
Manipulator (WAM) robot was used as the slave robot as
shown in Fig. 5. Two computers are used as the master and
slave controllers. The master controller is connected to the
master robot through Þrewire cable, and the slave controller
is connected to the slave robot through Control Area Network
(CAN) bus. The position, orientation and force information
is transmitted between the computers through the Ethernet.
2-Channel controllers are used to enforce position and force
tracking. Result of the position and orientation of the master
controller is given in Fig. 6. The workspace we proposed is
demonstrated. [17], [18], [19].
B. Haptics Experiment
In this experiment, the system interacts with a unilateral
deformable virtual wall in virtual environment(VE). The
virtual wall passes the origin and is perpendicular to the
z axis. Its force and torque feedback functions are deÞned
in Eqs. 25 and 26. The desired joint position is computed
using the kinematics of the new system, the Þgure shows that
the singularity problem is avoided because of the method we
used. The force collaboration between the Omnis is shown
in Fig. 7. All of them are shown in the end-effector frame
of the Omnis.

VI. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORKS
A novel 6 DOF haptic device is proposed in this paper.
Its kinematics and force control are discussed. Its actuation
redundancy issue is also addressed. This device provides a
large workspace, great force feedback and a low built cost.
A haptic and a teleoperation experiment are presented to
demonstrate its capability.
Other mechanisms can also be added to this system in
future works to extend its functionality. For example, forceps
can be installed to control the motion of any robot end
effector such as robotic hands, or forceps. These different
end-effectors can bring a variety of potential applications to
our new haptic system, such as telesurgery or radioactive
material remote handling. In haptics research, a 6 DOF
force feedback can help the operator interact with the virtual
environment better than haptics devices with less degrees
of freedom. For instance, when simulating the process of
using an electric drill to drill a hole in a stiff object,
torque feedback is the major portion of the haptic feedback.
Therefore, a 6 DOF master controller would provide a lot
more information than 3 DOF master controllers.
