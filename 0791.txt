Abstract— Free-flying space robot’s nonlinearity and 
strong coupling characters make the dynamics and 
control of such system more complicated than a terrestrial 
robot system. The Space robots are always built in very 
light for saving the launch energy. The flexibility of the 
joints and links is considerable arising from its elasticity. 
Controlling this manipulator is more complex than 
controlling one with rigid joints due to the interactions of 
rigid and flexible motion, in which only a single actuation 
signal can be applied at each joint and has to control the 
flexure of both the joint itself and the link attached to it. 
To discussing an under-actuated flexible-link 
flexible-joint space manipulator, a free-flying space 
manipulator with one flexible link and two flexible 
revolute joints is presented in this paper. The dynamical 
Lagrange equation is established, and a singularly 
perturbed model has been formulated and used for 
designing a reduced-order controller. This controller 
consists of a rigid control component and two fast control 
components. Numerical simulations show that the link 
and joint vibrations have been stabilized effectively with 
good tracking performance. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
Outer space is an ultimate field for the application of 
robotics technology. As outer space is a harsh environment 
with extreme temperatures, vacuum, radiation, gravity, and 
great distances, human access is very difficult and hazardous 
and is therefore limited. To assist human activities in space 
robotic manipulators have been playing essential roles in 
orbital operations [1]–[5]. To obtain a good tracking 
performance of space-based robots, various dynamic 
modeling and control techniques have been developed during 
the past several decades. Most of modeling and control 
methods for space robotic systems assumed that robot arms 
mounted on their spacecraft are rigid [6]–[9]. But space robots 
are built very light in order to save expensive launch energy, 
which results in considerable joint and link flexibilities [10]. 
Link flexibility is a consequence of the lightweight of 
manipulator arms. Joint flexibility arises because of the 
elasticity of the joint. Thus, flexible space robots undergo two 
types of motion, i.e. rigid and flexible motion. Because of the 
interaction of these motions, the resulting dynamic equations

of flexible space robots are highly complex and, in turn, the 
control task becomes more challenging compared to that of 
rigid space robots. Therefore, a first step towards designing an 
efficient control strategy for these manipulators must be aimed 
at developing accurate dynamic models that can characterize 
the above flexibilities along with the rigid dynamics. 
The dynamic equation of flexible dual-arm space robot 
based on the Lagrange method and the assumed mode method 
was presented and the inversion-dynamic nonlinear 
compensation and PD feedback is performed to track the 
desired trajectory [11]. A methodology for designing stable 
manipulation-variable feedback controls of flexible 
free-flying space manipulators for positioning control to a 
static target and continuous path tracking control was 
proposed [12], which was based on virtual rigid manipulator 
(VRM) concept and can extend other controls for rigid 
manipulators to those for flexible free-flying space 
manipulators. A simple direct adaptive control law was 
presented which improved the performance of vibration 
control algorithms effectively [13]. Different controllers 
based on singular perturbation theory were proposed in 
[14]–[17], which can track the trajectory and damp out the 
vibration of the flexible link simultaneously. An experimental 
study of a control policy for end-effector trajectory tracking of 
structurally flexible space-based manipulators was made [18]. 
A passivity approach for the control design of flexible 
joint robots was applied to the rate control of a three-link arm 
modeled after the shoulder yaw joint of the Space Shuttle 
Remote Manipulator System (RMS) [19]. A system consisting 
of several flexible joint robots mounted on a spacecraft with 
closed kinematic chain constraints was studied and a 
coordinated controller was proposed, which consisted of a 
position and internal force controller for the slow subsystem 
and a joint elastic force controller for the fast subsystem [20]. 
An extended Kalman filter strategy to estimate state variables 
from noisy measurements in flexible joint space manipulators 
was presented [21]. A method of adaptive fuzzy compensation 
and backstepping control for the trajectory tracking precision 
of space robot flexible-joint was proposed [22]. The dynamic 
model of a space manipulator with flexible joints and friction 
was established, and the anti-windup nonlinear PD control to 
avoid the torque saturation of the joints was presented [23]. 
The dynamic modeling and singular perturbation control of 
free-floating space robot with flexible joints were made 
[24-25]. 
From above, we can see that there are some works on 
space manipulator considering only link flexibilities or only 
joint elasticities. Space robots with both joint and link 
flexibilities are seldom studied. Terrestrial manipulator with 
both flexible links and elastic joints have been studied.

Ignoring the flexible effects caused flexible-link flexible-joint 
robots uncontrolled [26]. The coupling effect of the flexible 
joint and the flexible link on the dynamic singularity of the 
flexible manipulator was addressed [27]. Subudhi A dynamic 
modelling technique for a manipulator with multiple flexible 
links and flexible joints based on a combined Euler–Lagrange 
formulation and assumed modes method was proposed 
[28-29]. Output Feedback Sliding Mode Control architecture 
for slewing flexible joint and link robot structures was 
presented [30]. Singular perturbation controller of space 
manipulator with flexible-link and flexible-joint was 
investigated [31].
 
Since communication devices and solar panels are more 
sensitive to the change of spacecraft’s attitude than to that of 
spacecraft’s position, it’s important to study space 
manipulator with attitude controlled spacecraft (that is a 
free-flying space manipulator)[32]–[33].This paper deals with 
the problem of controlling a flexible-link flexible-joint 
free-flying space manipulator. Firstly the dynamic model of a 
free-flying space manipulator with a flexible link and two 
flexible revolute joints is established by applying the 
Lagrange equations and linear momentum conservation 
theory. Secondly based on singular perturbation theory, the 
system is transformed into two subsystems: a flexible-link 
subsystem and a fast flexible-joint subsystem. The 
flexible-link subsystem is further transformed into two 
subsystems: a rigid subsystem and a fast flexible-link 
subsystem. A composite controller which consists of a rigid 
control component and two fast control components is 
proposed. The flexible-joint fast controller is designed to 
stabilize the flexible-joint fast subsystem around the 
equilibrium trajectory set up by the flexible-link subsystem 
under the effect of the rigid controller and the flexible-link fast 
controller. The flexible-link fast subsystem controller will 
damp out the vibration of the flexible link using optimal 
Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) method. The rigid 
subsystem controller dominates the trajectory tracking of 
coordinated motion. Finally the numerical simulation is 
carried out, which confirms the controller proposed is feasible 
and effective. 
I. DYNAMIC MODELLING  
The planar free-flying space robot with one flexible-link 
and two flexible-joints as shown in Fig.1 is studied. The 
flexible joint is dynamically simplified as a linear torsion 
spring that works as a connector between the actuator and the 
link [34]. The system consists of the base B

The controller performances are shown in Figs. 3-4. It can 
be seen from Fig. 3 that good tracking performance is 
achieved through the application of the proposed controller. 
Fig. 4 shows that the first and second mode of vibration of the 
flexible link are well damped.  
IV. CONCLUSION 
The planar flexible-link flexible-joint free-flying space 
manipulator dynamic model has been established by using the 
Euler–Lagrange principle. The introduced dynamic model 
first is disassembled into three subsystems: the flexible-joint 
fast subsystem, the flexible-link fast subsystem and the rigid 
space manipulator. The general model formulation is 
exploited to obtain the closed-form dynamic models for 
practical free-flying space robots with any number of flexible 
links and flexible joints. 
Based on the introduced dynamic model, the composite 
controller which consists of a rigid control component and two 
fast control components is proposed. The results of numerical 
simulation indicate that good tracking is performed and link 
vibrations are suppressed effectively.
