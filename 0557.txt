Abstract-Aiming at the robot drilling perpendicularity in 
aircraft assembly, a surface normal measurement method is 
presented and a drilling end effector is designed. Four laser 
ranging sensors are uniformly distributed around the drill to 
measure the surface normal as four non-coplanar points define 
a unique circumscribed sphere and the sphere center can be 
calculated. By this principle, the method measures four points 
coordinates on the curved surface in the drilling area using four 
laser ranging sensors. If the four laser ranging sensors are close 
enough to each other, it is reasonable to assume that the drilling 
point is on the sphere surface. Therefore, the connection line of 
the sphere center and the drilling point is the surface normal at 
the drilling point. The angle ? between the normal and the axis 
of the drill is calculated and if ? is larger than 0.5 degree, the 
drilling end effector will adjust the attitude of the drill to make 
sure ? is smaller than 0.5 degree to meet the requirement in 
aircraft assembly. A novel adjusting mechanism is designed in 
the end effector which can keep drill vertex immobile when 
adjusting drill position. Thus, it is not required to remove the 
drill vertex to the mark point. Simulation results of three kinds 
curved surfaces show that the surface normal measurement 
method is accurate and efficient. Experiments on aviation 
drilling system results also demonstrate the adjusting 
mechanism is effective with high accuracy. 
 
I. INTRODUCTION 
The service life of modern airplane has been improved 
increasingly and it can reach 5000 hours for main trunk 
airline[1]. It is reported that 70% fatigue failure accidents of 
airplane body are caused by joints position and 80% fatigue 
crack comes from riveting holes[2]. An experiment on Ti 
alloy indicates that the fatigue life of bolt will reduce 47% if 
the riveting holes are tilt beyond 2 degrees[3]. Therefore, the 
verticality of riveting holes has an extremely important effect 
on airplane life. 
The verticality of a riveting hole depends on whether the 
normal at the drilling point coincides with the axis of the hole. 
Thus, surface normal measurement is a key technology in an 
aircraft automatic drilling system and the accuracy of 
measurement will greatly influence the verticality[4]. In 
recent years, many researchers have conducted a great deal of 
studies on the calculation method of surface normal. Megumi

Saito measures a transparent curved surface normal by 
using polarization of light[5]. Hasegawa chooses a pair of 
wedge-prisms and a ranging sensor to obtain surface normal 
[6]. However, it is not suitable to measure normal by 
principles of optics in drilling robot system. Although 
quadratic surface fitting algorithm [7] possesses high 
precision in measuring surface normal on quadratic surface, 
but its accuracy is reduced when applied on the measurement 
of other surfaces and the selection of the measurement 
position should be optimized by a data reconciliation method 
which reduces the measurement efficiency. Gong et al. 
presents a three-point algorithm in which three laser ranging 
sensors are equispaced around a circle[8]. The normal is 
calculated from the cross product of any two vectors that are 
tangent to the surface at the drilling point. But the subpoint 
coordinate of drill vertex is difficult to measure in actual 
application. According to four non-coplanar points define a 
unique circumscribed sphere, Wang et al. proposes a 
algorithm of normal attitude regulation[9] which established 
a coordinate system at every laser ranging sensors and 
complicated coordinate transformation is needed. Besides, a 
reorientation algorithm is needed to remove the drill vertex to 
the drilling point as the design mechanism of his end effector. 
After measuring the surface normal, an adjusting 
mechanism is needed in the end effector which can adjust the 
drill position to make the axis of drill coincide with the 
normal at drilling point. A robot drilling system with attitude 
adjusting module produced by the Electroimpact company 
has been applied in airplane assembly in Boeing 
company[10]. A 2-d.o.f. orientation device is designed by 
J.R.Serrac’ n based on 2UPS?1U mechanism[11]. It can 
adjust the attitude of the scalpel and has applied in bone 
milling surgeries experiment. Using 2-DOFs rotation 
motions to rotate respectively along two axes which are 
perpendicular to each other, Wang et al. designs an 
end-effector for drilling robot[9]. However, it is needed to 
move the drill vertex to the drill position after adjusting the 
drill attitude. J. Antonio Briones designs a drilling robot 
based on CAPAMAN parallel mechanism and does 
experiments with the robot[12]. A 2R1T parallel mechanism 
is used by Shan et al. to realize adjusting the attitude of 
principal axis. Some drilling experiments have been done 
with the mechanism on butt joint of airplane wing body[13]. 
 Compared with the above methods, the surface normal 
measurement algorithm is simple without complicated 
matrix transformation in different coordinate systems and the 
designed adjusting mechanism is novel which avoiding 
remove the drill vertex to the drilling point. The rest of this

According to the knowledge of geometry, the center of the 
sphere is the point of intersection of L

.Therefore, 
from (11) and (12),we can obtain the coordinate O

the sphere center. So four points which are not co-plane 
arbitrarily in space can determine a sphere and its center 
coordinate can be calculated. 
Assuming a drill position coordinate ( , , )

workpiece surface, it can be accepted that ( , , )

M x y z is on 
the sphere which is circumscribed with A, B, C, and D when 
the four points are close to each other. Thus, vector quantity

III. DRILLING END EFFECTOR 
Drilling end effector is a key component of the robot 
drilling system. As the accuracy of industry robot can not 
meet the requirement in aircraft assembly[14], an adjusting 
mechanism is needed in the end effector to adjust the attitude 
of drill.  
As shown in Fig.4, the end effector consists of the Spindle 
& the Feed Unit(SFU), the Vision Location Unit(VLU), the 
Adjusting Attitude Unit(AAU), the Scrap Absorption & the 
Press Unit(SAPU), the Normal Measurement Unit(NMU). 
The position of the drilling mark point is orientated by VLU 
and then the normal at the drilling point is measured by NMU. 
The angle ? between the normal and the axis of drill will be 
calculated and if ? does not meet the requirement in aircraft 
assembly, that is ?<0.5 degree, the attitude of drill will be 
adjusted by AAU. Finally, the SAPU press on the workpiece 
to prevent the vibration during drilling and the SFU start to 
drill. The SAPU will absorb the drill chippings to avoid they 
scratch the holes. The working flow is shown in Fig.5.

In AAU, an adjusting mechanism is designed which 
includes two eccentric discs and a spherical pair. The draft of 
the mechanism is shown in Fig.6. There are two rotundity 
eccentric discs in the mechanism and both radii of the 
eccentric discs are r. The geometry axis of the small eccentric 
4483
  
disc coincides with the eccentric axis of big eccentric disc, as 
O
1
 line shown in Fig.6. O line is the geometry axis of big 
eccentric disc and O
2
 line is the eccentric axis of the small 
eccentric disc. A spherical plain bearing is mounted at the 
eccentric axis of the small eccentric disc and the axis of drill 
across the spherical hinge. The drill vertex locates at the 
center of sphericalpair, that is O
sp
 point. When the two 
eccentric discs rotate a full circle, the swept area of the axis of 
drill is a taper, as shown in Fig.7. That is, when the two 
eccentric discs rotate different angles, the axis of drill can 
reach an arbitrarily position in the taper and the progress is 
an adjusting attitude of the drill axis. As the drill vertex is 
located at the center of the spherical pair center, during the 
adjusting progress, the drill vertex is static which can avoid 
removing the drill vertex to drill position and this is an 
immense advantage compared with other end effectors which 
are presented in [9][15] which need a reposition progress 
after adjusting the drill attitude.

A. Experimental result 
The drilling end effector is mounted on the experimental 
platform of aviation drilling robot, as shown in Fig. 9. The 
aviation drilling robot comprises the base body, the suckers, 
the drilling end effector and the control system. The base 
body bears the weight of the drilling end effector and the 
drilling end effector can move on the base body with two 
directions. The suckers are adsorbed on the workpiece 
surface. The drilling function is completed by the drilling 
end effector, and the Austria B&R controller is used in the 
control system.

In the experiment, the drilling end effector scans the 
mark point on the workpiece surface, when the mark point 
is determined, the end effector moves on the base body until 
the drill vertex is above the mark point.Then, four laser 
ranging sensors emit laser to the surface to obtain four 
projection points on the surface, as shown in Fig.10. The 
measurement normal 
m
n of mark point M is calculated by 
four points measurement method, and the connection line 
between drill vertex and spherical hinge center is the drill 
centerline direction, then we can get the direction of unit 
vector

in aircraft assembly. Fig. 11 shows the comparison of the 
effect of drilling. (a) displays the drilling effect by an end 
effector without attitude adjustment mechanism while (b)

Comparing (a) with (b), take the holes drilled on Al for 
example, the diameters of the two holes are measured at 
intervals of 30 degrees and the diametersÕ profile of the holes 
are shown in Fig. 12.

that the roundness of the hole drilled by the designed 
end-effector with attitude mechanism is far smaller than that 
of the hole drilled by end-effector without attitude 
mechanism. The smaller the roundness is, the smaller the 
perpendicularity is. Thus, it can be proved indirectly that the 
surface normal measurement and the double eccentric discs 
adjusting mechanism can prove the perpendicularity of holes.  
 
V. CONCLUSION 
In this paper, a novel method for surface normal 
measurement and an original design for adjusting drill 
attitude in robot drilling end effector are presented. The 
normal at drilling point is measured by four laser ranging 
sensors which are equispaced on a circle. Simulation results 
show the measurement method for surface normal possesses a 
high accuracy. The characteristic of the adjusting mechanism 
is that it can make drill vertex keep static during adjusting 
attitude of the drill. As the original design for adjusting 
mechanism, the drilling efficiency will be increased because 
this mechanism can avoid removing drill vertex to the 
drilling position after adjusting the attitude of the drill. 
Experiments on aluminium alloy, titanium alloy and carbon 
fibre composite are implemented by a climbing robot drilling 
system. The results indicate that the method for surface 
normal measurement and the adjusting mechanism are 
effective to improve the verticality of holes in aircraft 
assembly.
