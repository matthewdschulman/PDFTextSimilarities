Cooperative human-robot haptic navigation

Abstract— This paper proposes a novel use of haptic feedback
for human navigation with a mobile robot. Assuming that a
path-planner has provided a mobile robot with an obstacle-
free trajectory, the vehicle must steer the human from an initial
to a desired target position by only interacting with him/her
via a custom-designed vibro-tactile bracelet. The subject is free
to decide his/her own pace and a warning vibrational signal
is generated by the bracelet only when a large deviation with
respect to the planned trajectory is detected by the vision sensor
on-board the robot. This leads to a cooperative navigation
system that is less intrusive, more ﬂexible and easy-to-use than
the ones existing in literature. The effectiveness of the proposed
system is demonstrated via extensive real-world experiments.
I. INTRODUCTION
A. Motivation and related work
Let us assume that a human wants to reach a ﬁnal location
in a large environment with the help of a mobile robot (see
Fig. 1). Possible scenarios include assistance of an older adult
or a visually-impaired person, or helping a person who is in
a dangerous situation with poor visibility and no way of
hearing clearly due to environmental noise.
The human is free to select his/her desired linear velocity
and the robot should not force him/her to its pace as long
as environmental obstacles are avoided and he/she is able to
safely reach the target location. The robot guides the human
by only regulating his/her angular velocity: a simple and low-
intrusive way to do this is to use haptic signals provided by
wearable devices (e.g., a wrist-worn bracelet). In this way,
the person always remains in charge of the ﬁnal decision to
take, and he/she can always override the “suggestions” given
by the navigation system. The type of correction made by the
haptic bracelet should always be perceived as very soft, and
unnatural vibrations should be avoided as much as possible.
The main source of inspiration for this work came
from [1], where a passive approach inspired by the classical
“Cobot” philosophy [2] is adopted for guiding an elderly
person using the brakes of a commercial walker, and from [3]
where the authors propose a leader-follower formation con-
trol strategy, which in this paper has been adapted to our
speciﬁc human-robot setup.
A large body of literature exists, indeed, on the theme of
assistive robotics and human-robot cooperation/navigation.
In [4], an EKF-based indoor localization system is proposed

for the visually impaired. The sensing platform consists here
of an inertial measurement unit and a 2D laser scanner.
In [5], the authors proposed an approach that exploits the
arm compliance of a humanoid robot to follow the human
guidance in a physical cooperative task. The robot estimates
the human pose and moves accordingly. In [6], the authors
developed an assistive-guide prototype robot to help visually-
impaired people to navigate unfamiliar areas. However the
control of the robot does not account for the user’s motion but
only considers the deviation of the robot from the reference
path or the proximity to obstacles. Moreover, the authors did
not focus on the human-robot interaction. In [7], the authors
proposed a travel aid for the blind which consists of a belt,
a portable computer and ultrasonic sensors. Acoustic signals
displayed to the user via stereophonic headphones allow
to guide him/her around obstacles in pursuit of the target
direction as well as to represent an image of the environment
using stereophonic effects.
Noninvasive human-robot interaction can be easily
achieved via haptic feedback. In fact, visual and auditory
channels may be overloaded with information, thus resulting
in a rapid error increase and in a consequent reduction
in overall user performance. A possible solution to this
problem is to deliver this information through an underuti-
lized sensory channel. As with sound, a tactile stimulus is
made up of a signal with varying frequency and amplitude,
but differently from the auditory feedback, tactile feedback
directly engages our motor learning system [8]. In [9], the
authors applied force and position signals to the user’s hand
in order to guide the human operator in large environments.
The position of the user is transformed into the target envi-
ronment. A desired target path is then inferred based on the
human’s motion, on additional information from the target
environment, or on task-speciﬁc criteria. Similar approaches
usually focus on tele-operating a remote device and guiding
the user in the remote environment. However, although haptic
devices which provide kinesthetic feedback generate strong

forces and effectively guide human motion, they are typically
bulky, grounded and not portable in large environments.
To address this issue, in [10], an haptic belt is used for
waypoint navigation: however, the system relies not only on
vibro-tactile stimuli but also on GPS information which is
not available indoors or in some outdoor environments (e.g.
urban areas with tall buildings).
B. Original contributions and organization
The setup considered in this paper consists of a mobile
robot equipped with a vision sensor (an RGB-D camera)
and a human subject wearing a custom-designed vibro-tactile
bracelet. The robot follows a pre-planned path and helps
the human to reach a desired target position. A predeﬁned
distance and orientation should be maintained between the
human and the robot at all times. The leader-follower forma-
tion control strategy proposed in [3] has been tailored to our
human-robot setup: in fact, recent studies [11] have shown
a close relationship between the shape of human locomotor
paths in goal-directed movements, and the simpliﬁed kine-
matic model of a wheeled mobile robot. Thus, nonholonomic
constraints similar to those governing the motion of mobile
robots, seem to be at work when a human is walking: in
particular, the authors have shown that the shoulders can
be considered as a sort of steering wheel that drives the
human body with a short delay (of about one ﬁfth of a
second). Differently from [3], in our scenario the human
should always be able to freely select his/her linear velocity.
A speciﬁc haptic feedback is sent to the user in order to
adjust his/her angular velocity according to the formation
speciﬁcs. Our purpose is to send easily processable on/off
signals to the human, so that he/she can promptly respond
to the stimuli of the guiding robot.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Sect. II and
Sect. III present our control strategy and the haptic-feedback
generation mechanism, respectively. Sect. IV describes our
human visual detection algorithm and Sect. V reports the
results of real-world experiments. Finally, in Sect. VI con-
clusions are drawn and possible subjects of future research
are outlined.
II. PROBLEM FORMULATION
In this section, we brieﬂy review the leader-follower
formation control strategy proposed in [3], and show how
to adapt it to our human-guidance problem.
A. Formation control setup

are positive control gains (observe that G is
always invertible as long as d/l > 0, which is always true
in practice).
Note that since nonholonomic constraints analogous to
those governing the motion of a unicycle robot, seem to be
at work when a human is walking [11], the control law (1)
can also be applied (with suitable modiﬁcations) to mixed
human-robot formations (cf. [12]). In what follows, we will
show how to tailor (1) to our human-guidance problem. No-
tice that in our framework the distinction between leader and
follower is not relevant: in fact, here both agents cooperate
without direct physical interaction to achieve a common goal
(reach the desired target position).
B. Human-robot guidance
Differently from [3], in our scenario the human should
always be able to freely choose his/her linear velocity.
However, in order to be driven byR
r
to the target position,
his/her angular velocity should be suitably regulated. On
the other side, the robot should change its linear velocity
according to that of the user, while its angular velocity
depends on the speciﬁc trajectory from the initial to the
target position. Since the desired geometric path of the robot
is the result of an on-board planning algorithm, we assume
the trajectory is smooth (i.e., the tangent to the trajectory is
well deﬁned at each point), and that its curvature is known.
Typically, a planner yields a smooth trajectory which consists
of the union of segments and circular arcs. The angular

Remark 1: Suppose that the robot estimates the human
motion using an on-board vision sensor with limited ﬁeld of
view (cf. Fig. 1 and Sect. IV). Since the formation parameters
are deﬁned in the reference frame of the robot, then a suitable
choice of l

allows to always maintain the human

Note that while it is not problematic to drive a robot
with velocityv

to a human. In the next section we will show how
to use haptic feedback to address this challenging problem.
III. HAPTIC FEEDBACK
In this section, we describe the main features of our haptic
device and the nature of the vibro-tactile feedback provided
to the human. We also present the results of an experimental
analysis conducted to assess how the stimuli produced by
the bracelet are perceived by humans.
A. Description of the haptic bracelet
Studies have demonstrated that vibration is best on hairy
skin and in bony areas [13], [14]. In particular, wrists and
spine are generally preferred for detecting vibrations, with
arms next in line [15]. Moreover movement can decrease
detection rate and increases response time of particular body
areas. For example, walking affects lower body sites the
most [15].
Since the haptic feedback will provide the human with
information about his/her angular velocity, two vibrating
motors will be used to independently warn the user. However,
since real robots have strict limitations on their maximum
linear velocity, a third motor needs to be used to warn the
human when he/she is too close to the robot.
A bracelet shape with three vibrating motors circling
the forearm, ensures sufﬁcient distance between the motors
while covering a minimal forearm area. In fact, the minimal
distance between two stimuli to be differentiated is about
35 mm on the forearms [13], [16].
Following these guidelines, we designed a wrist-worn hap-
tic bracelet in which three cylindrical vibro-motors,L (left),
(a)
(b)
(c)
Fig. 3. Human-robot interaction is achieved via a vibro-tactile bracelet
equipped with three vibrating motors (a), attached to an elastic wristband (b).
The three motors are disposed equidistantly in order to improve the vibro-
tactile perception. The Li-Ion battery and the Arduino board are in (c).
C (center) and R (right) are independently controlled via
an external PC using the Bluetooth communication protocol
(see Fig. 3). The communication is realized with an RN42
Bluetooth module connected to an Arduino mini pro 3.3V
with a baud rate of 9600. An Atmega 328 micro-controller
installed on the Arduino board is used to independently
control the vibration amplitude of each motor. The three
Precision Microdrives 303-100 Pico Vibe 3.2 mm vibration
motors were placed into three fabric pockets on the external
surface of the bracelet (the width of the wristband is about60
mm), with shafts aligned with the elbow bone (see Fig. 3).
Since the rotating masses are exposed, we placed each motor
inside a plastic cylindrical case in order to protect them from
damage and guarantee a correct operation. The motors have
a vibration frequency range of 100 Hz-280 Hz (the maximal
sensitivity is achieved around 200 Hz-300 Hz [17]).
B. Haptic feedback generation
In order to not overload the tactile channel and to not
reduce the recognition time, few but signiﬁcative signals
should be sent to the user. To this end, we do not modulate
the frequency of the signal but adopt a simple on/off mech-
anism. When a motor is engaged, it vibrates at a frequency
of 250 Hz with an amplitude of 0.6 g in order to achieve
maximal sensitivity.

Since the maximal linear velocity of real-world robots is
limited, the robot might be unable to maintain the formation
if the human walks too fast. To avoid this, a suitable signal
is sent to the central motor to warn the human when he/she
is getting too close to the robot. Let ? ? R

In order to reduce the aftereffect problem (vibration effects
usually persist after the end of the stimulation, see [18] and
the references therein), we displayed a periodic vibrational
pattern with period 2? instead of a continuous signal (see
Fig. 4(a)). Moreover, to keep the signal recognition as simple
as possible, in the case of a combination of stimuli, we do
not superimpose them but alternate between the two patterns
reported in Fig. 4(a) and 4(b), respectively. It is worth noting
that we avoided cases in which all motors were turned on and
cases in which the left and right motors were contemporarily
activated, since they never occur in our human-guidance
problem.
C. Evaluation of the haptic bracelet
The proposed haptic bracelet has been tested on 8 healthy
subjects (6 males, age range 26-60, all right-handed): 4 of
them had experience with previous prototypes of our haptic
bracelet based, however, on different working principles.
None of the participants reported any deﬁciency in the
perception abilities (including vision, hearing, touch and
proprioception). In the evaluation, a single signal (center
C, left L, right R) or a combination of signals (center-left
CL, center-right CR) was sent to the haptic bracelet. The
subjects were asked to identify which motors were vibrating.
Each participant was informed about the procedure before the
beginning of the experiment and a 5-minute familiarization
period was given to each subject. The evaluation consisted
of two sets of 25 trials each: after each set the subjects
took a small break. Every signal was proposed ﬁve times
in a pseudo-randomized order with a vibrating frequency of
250 Hz and amplitude of 0.6 g. Sequences of stimulation
appeared in short bursts with ? = 0.2 s (see Fig. 4(a)).
The subjects could correctly perceive almost the totality
of the proposed stimuli (cf. Table I). The average time
elapsed to perceive the stimuli was approximately 1.31 s
with a standard deviation of 0.06 s. In order to evaluate the
statistical signiﬁcance of the differences between the stimuli,
we performed a one-way ANOV A [19] on the observed num-
ber of correct responses and on the elapsed time. ANOV A
analyzes the groups variances to test the heterogeneity of
their means. From our analysis, it turns out that the type of
stimulus does not signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the percentage of
correct responses or the elapsed time.

IV. HUMAN VISUAL DETECTION AND TRACKING
This section provides an overview of the major steps
of our method for detecting the human from the visual
information provided by an RGB-D camera on-board the
robot: our approach is quite general and can be applied
to other typologies of vision sensors (e.g., time-of-ﬂight
cameras) as well.
In what follows, we will assume that the robot xy-plane
is parallel to the ﬂoor. As a preliminary step, we perform
an extrinsic calibration of the RGB-D camera and robot
reference frames. The homogeneous matrixH
R
K
, that relates
the robot frame (R) with the camera frame (K), is estimated
using the algorithm proposed in [20]. This preliminary step
is necessary since the control strategy described in Sect. II
is computed with respect to the robot frame. We then use
NITE’s skeleton tracker to detect and track the human (see
Fig. 5(a)). Since the shoulders play an important role in
the nonholonomic description of human locomotion (cf.
Sect. I-B), in the detection phase we discard all the 3-D
points that are too far from the human’s torso. We ﬁrst
downsample the data using a voxel grid ﬁlter with a leaf size
of 2 cm (see Fig. 5(b)). We then express the downsampled
point cloud in the robot reference frame using the estimated
homogeneous matrix p
R
= H
R
K
p

, where p
K
represents
the point cloud of the human torso andp
R
the point cloud
in the robot’s frame. We then projectp
R
onto the robotxy-
plane and ﬁt an ellipse over the points (see Fig. 5(c)).

used to track the subject (the skeleton of the torso is shown in white). (b)
The points which are not close enough to the torso are discarded, while the
remaining points are down-sampled and expressed in the robot’s reference
frame. (c) The points are ﬁnally projected onto the robot xy-plane and the
position and orientation of the human body is determined via ellipse ﬁtting.
To improve the robustness when the skeleton tracker fails
during the human motion, we select the 3-D points in the
neighborhood of the previous human pose. We project those
points onto the robot xy-plane and then perform a cluster
ﬁltering discarding those clusters whose dimension is outside
a given range and whose distance is far enough from the
last tracked human position. Finally an ellipse ﬁtting is
performed over the resulting cluster. We relied on the Point
Cloud Library [21] to process the 3-D point data and extract
the information about the human motion.
V. EXPERIMENTAL VALIDATION
The effectiveness and robustness of our human-robot nav-
igation mechanism has been tested in a large indoor envi-
ronment using a Pioneer P3AT robot (which has a maximal
linear velocity of 0.7 m/s) equipped with a backward facing
Microsoft’s Kinect camera.
Six healthy subjects (age range 23-30, all males and right-
handed) were involved in our tests
1
: ﬁve of them participated
in the evaluation of the haptic bracelet (cf. Sect. III-C). All
subjects were blindfolded and instructed to move according
to the tactile stimulation, but no indications were given about
the linear and/or angular velocities to be kept. Two different
trajectories were considered for the robot in order to test
the haptic feedback when the user continuously changes his
direction (see Fig. 6(a)). Each subject performed 4 trials: 2
trials with trajectory A and 2 trials with trajectory B in a
random order.
The visual tracking algorithm described in Sect. IV was run

time of the motors of the mobile robot, the control inputs
of the human and robot were computed every 0.2 s and
sent to the robot via the TCP/IP protocol. Regarding the
formation parameters, we set l

Figs. 6(d), 6(e) report the mean and the standard deviation
of the norm of the formation error for each of the 24 trials
(i.e. 4 trials for each of the 6 subjects), and the percentage
of time over the all trials in which the vibro-tactile bracelet
was activated. In blue it is shown the ﬁrst subject who did
not participate in the evaluation of the haptic device (cf.
Sect. III-C). As we can notice from Fig. 6(d), the mean
of the norm of the formation error is always smaller than
0.9 m, which we deem acceptable for the application at
hand. Moreover, although the ﬁrst user never tried the haptic
bracelet before, he was able to correctly recognize the haptic
stimuli and cooperate with the robot.
The mean of the norm of the formation error over all
the trials, is 0.52 m with a standard deviation of 0.16 m
and the average time in which the bracelet was turned on is
the 80.9% of the total duration of the trial with a standard
deviation of 10.9%. In this respect, the robot trajectories
represent a sort of worst case due to the continuous change of
the human direction. A possible way to reduce the bracelet’s
activation time is to use a robot with higher maximal linear
velocity, in which case the central motor of the bracelet may
be eliminated. This option will be considered in our future
research.
VI. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper we have proposed a new haptic paradigm
for the guidance of a human in an unknown environment
with a mobile robot. The subject is free to decide his/her
own pace and a warning vibrational signal is generated by a
wrist-worn haptic bracelet only when a large deviation with
respect to the planned trajectory is sensed. With respect to the
existing robot navigation schemes, our cooperative guidance
system is less intrusive, more ﬂexible and user-friendly and
it does not require a long training program. The effectiveness
of the proposed approach is demonstrated via an extensive
experimental validation. In future works, we would like to
perform experiments in cluttered and noisy environments,
and conduct tests with elderly people and subjects with vision
or vestibular disorders.
