I. INTRODUCTION
Design, analysis and accurate control of legged robot
behaviors have been among difﬁcult challenges faced by
robotics researchers. This line of inquiry brought together
researchers from different areas, including biomechanics
[1], dynamical systems [2], control theory [3], mechanical
engineering [4] and materials science [5], towards the goal
of building high performance autonomous legged machines.
Surprisingly, simple hybrid spring-mass models have been
able to capture the essence of basic running behaviors, em-
bodied by the now widely accepted Spring-Loaded Inverted
Pendulum (SLIP) model [6]. Since its early discovery [7],
to its ﬁrst instantiation on physical robot platforms [8], with
more recent detailed analysis [9–12], as well as extensions
and adoption by morphologically different platform designs
[8,13–16], this model continues to provide a rich context in
which running behaviors can be studied and implemented.
One of the challenges in the embodiment of the fully
passive SLIP model in physical robots [17,18] is the manner
in which system energy can be managed through active
components.Insomecases,suchastheﬂightprecompression
of the leg in the Bow-Leg platform [13], this is accomplished
without compromising the passivity of the stance phase.

Another approach which remains within the conﬁnes of the
ideal model has been active modulation of spring stiffness
during stance, implemented by some recent platform designs
such as the BiMASC [19] and MABEL [20] platforms.
Alternatively, for platforms that use a hip actuator as the
only energy input, extensions to the model were necessary
to support controller design and stability analysis [21].
Among the best combinations of mechanical simplicity
and minimal deviations from the ideal spring-mass model are
designs that incorporate a linear positional actuator in series
with the leg spring. Raibert’s hoppers were similar to this
design in their use of a pneumatic actuator in series with the
spring [8,22]. The difﬁculty of accurate position control for
these actuators was addressed by the ARL Monopod [14],
which uses a DC motor coupled with the spring through
a ball screw. More recent instantiations of this idea can
be observed in the ATRIAS biped [16] as well as other
small experimental platforms [23]. Recent efforts include
using principles behind series-elastic actuators, considering
the combination of the spring and the actuator as a force
transducer [24,25]. Improvements in rough terrain mobility,
as well as new analytically tractable solutions to resulting
dynamics have been reported in the literature [26,27].
In this paper, we propose a novel method that bridges
the analytic gap between such serially actuated compliant
leg designs and the passive SLIP model. In particular, we
consider the lossy SLIP model, a generalization of the
ideal, conservative model, as a basis for our locomotion
controllers. Our recent work on approximate but accurate
analytic solutions to the dynamics of this system have been
instrumental in the construction of adaptive, model-based
controllers and state estimators for running behaviors [11].
We now propose to actively modulate the leg force through
the series elastic leg actuation to obtain a virtual SLIP model
whose viscous damping coefﬁcient can be selected as desired
by a high level gait controller.
Active control of damping is traditionally considered
for vibration control in various application areas [28–30],
wherein dissipative forces are actively introduced into the
system to attenuate unwanted vibrations. In contrast, systems
with different, possibly negative, damping coefﬁcients at
different parts of their state space have been used to induce
stable oscillatory behavior that are useful for many applica-
tion domains [31], including locomotion [32]. The novelty
of our approach lies in our goal of embedding a simple,
analytically tractable templatesystemwithinamorecomplex
anchor structure [17]. As a result, we are able to ensure the
applicability of analytic models and gait controllers designed

for the lossy SLIP model, providing a useful abstraction for
the control of running behaviors. We also show, through
systematic simulation studies, that energy efﬁciency, control
accuracy as well as power requirements on the leg actuation
resulting from this strategy are better than its most common
alternative, variable stiffness [33], for regulating system en-
ergy when actuator limitations are considered. For simplicity
of the presentation, we limit the scope of this paper to a
vertical model that captures all relevant issues in controlling
the energy for a hopping system, noting that our method can
readily be generalized to planar running behaviors thanks to
the weak coupling between radial and angular dynamics as
described in our earlier work [11].

Themathematicalmodelfortheverticalhopperwithseries
actuation in the leg, which we call VA-SLIP, is illustrated in
Fig. 1.a. Itincorporates a linear actuator in series with the leg
spring in order to inject or remove energy from the system.
This actuator is assumed to be position controlled, with its
length u considered as a control input. Similar to planar
SLIP models, this model alternates between stance and ﬂight
phases, that can further be decomposed into compression
and decompression, and ascent and descent, respectively.
Touchdown, liftoff, bottom, and apex events, respectively
identiﬁed with subscripts td, lo, b, and a, mark transitions
among these sub-phases and are deﬁned in the same way as
the ideal SLIP model [11].
The VA-SLIP model follows ballistic trajectories during
ﬂight, captured by the dynamics ¨ y =?g. Stance dynamics,
however, are those of a second-order spring-mass system
with a constant forcing term due to gravity, and the spring
length modulated through the actuator input, taking the form
¨ y=?g?

Since we focus on a purely vertical system, a Poincar´ e
section at the apex point yields the one dimensional apex
state X :=y
a
. As usual, we deﬁne the apex return map as a
combination of four components as

are subscripted with u since they depend on the particular
choice of control strategy during stance.
B. The Template: Vertical SLIP with Tunable Damping
In contrast to the actuated VA-SLIP model, which closely
corresponds to the physical robot implementation, Fig. 1.b
shows the passive SLIP model with a tunable damping
coefﬁcient d
?
, which we call VD-SLIP. We will use this
modelasadynamicaltemplatetointerfaceourhighlevelgait

for this model are identical to those of the actuated model,
but stance dynamics take the form

excluding the actuation and incorporating a different damp-
ing coefﬁcient, d

For the planar lossy SLIP model, our previous work
revealed an accurate approximation for the return map [11].
Unlike the planar SLIP model, however, vertical hopper
dynamics admit an exact solution that we outline in the rest
of this section. Energy is conserved during ﬂight, yielding
descent and ascent maps as

These derivations complete the Poincar´ e map, allowing us
to formulate gait controllers focusing on the virtual damping
coefﬁcient d
?
as a control input in Sec. II-D.
C. Embedding VD-SLIP into VA-SLIP
As noted in Sec. II-A, the linear actuator in the VA-SLIP
model is assumed to be position controlled, meaning that
the control input u can be chosen as desired. Using this
model to realize VD-SLIP dynamics with a desired damping
coefﬁcient d
?
requires that the acceleration felt by the robot
body is identical for both, leading to the constraint

d

Solving this equation for the control input u hence yields the
continuous stance controller for the VA-SLIP anchor model
to properly realize VD-SLIP dynamics as
u
e
(t)=
d?d
?
k
˙ y(t), (14)
where d
?
denotes the desired virtual damping coefﬁcient.
Note that since this embedding exactly realizes VD-SLIP
dynamics, the analytic return map derivations of Sec. II-B
remain valid with d
?
replaced with d
?
.
Close inspection of (14) shows that energy input from
the actuator resulting from this embedding controller will be
spread throughout the stance phase in contrast to methods
that require abrupt step commands to the actuator such as
those used by Raibert’s hoppers or the ARL Monopod.
Consequently, this method will present substantial beneﬁts
in power requirements on the actuator compared to the
alternative method of adjusting spring stiffnessat bottom that
can also preserve the validity of analytic solutions [6,34].
D. High-Level Control of Energy
Now that we have active control over the damping co-
efﬁcient of the VD-SLIP template, we can use it for gait
control. For vertical hoppers, this is equivalent to controlling
system energy, with positive and negative values of d
?
used
for decreasing and increasing the energy level of the system,
respectively.

Fig. 2. Monotonic dependence of the change in VD-SLIP energy, ?E on

We begin by noting that the return map for the VD-SLIP
model now accepts d
?
as a control parameter, rewritten as
X
k+1
=
¯
f(X

?
). (15)
With this in mind, we formulate our gait controller in a
deadbeat structure, relying on the inverse of the return map
to yield
d
?

?1
(X

,X
?
), (16)
where X
?
denotes the desired apex height to be achieved in a
single stride. Even though the return map derived in Sec. II-
B does not readily admit an analytic inverse with respect to
the damping coefﬁcient, the one-dimensional and monotonic
relation between d
?
and the change in energy within the
stride ?E :=mg(y
a,k+1
?y

), illustrated in Fig. 2, admits an
efﬁcient numerical solution. This takes the form of a simple

E. Variable Stiffness Control
One of the more commonly used alternatives for analyt-
ically tractable control of the SLIP model relies on chang-
ing the effective spring constant of the leg, either through
mechanical linkages [33] or using active force control on
a structure such as the VA-SLIP model. In the latter case,
the actuator position required to realize a desired stiffness k
?
takes the form
u
s
(t)=
k?k
?
k
(y(t)?y
0
). (18)
Usually, analytic tractability is obtained by assuming a step
change in stiffness at the bottom instant, enabling the stance
4558
map to be studied in two parts. An example run with the VA-
SLIP model under this controller is shown in Fig. 3 as the
dot-dashed red plot. In subsequent sections, we will provide
a comparative study of this method in relation to our method.
F. Actuator Limitations and Practical Considerations
As evident from the example run in Fig. 3 with con-
stant virtual damping d
?
, there are discontinuities in u(t)
at touchdown and liftoff. Even though the discontinuity at
liftoff is not a problem since the actuator can be quickly
rewound during ﬂight, the necessity of having y = y
0
at
touchdown requires u(t
td
) = 0 at touchdown. The stiffness
control method of (18) exhibits a similar discontinuity in
actuator position at the bottom instant.
Such discontinuities clearly cannot be realized by any
physical position-controlled actuator. Consequently, we must
consider controller performance under actuator limitations in
order to ensure their practical applicability. In particular, we
willconsiderarealisticDCmotormodelwhereintheactuator
speed is limited by its force as
|˙ u(t)|< ˙ u
max
(1?|F|/F
max
), (19)
where F denotes the current force exerted on the actuator
by the leg spring, and F
max
is the maximum actuator force.
In the following sections, we will propose two modiﬁcations
to our method to address this practical limitation without
invalidating the analytic solutions for the VD-SLIP template
dynamics.
1) Energy Pumping Limited to Decompression: Inspec-
tion of (14) shows that u(t
b
)=0 at bottom, independent of
thevalueofd
?
.Consequently,thediscontinuityattouchdown
imposed by the gait controller in Sec. II-D can be eliminated
if the active tuning of damping is limited to decompression
alone. Fortunately, the solutions of Sec. II-D can be adapted
to this scenario by decomposing the stance phase into its
sub-maps. Fig. 3 shows the resulting simulation as the dotted
green line in comparison with the other methods.
The clear drawback of this modiﬁcation is that no energy
is injected into the system during compression, effectively
increasing power requirements on the actuator as is evident
from the larger actuator displacements in Fig. 3. Neverthe-
less, analytic solutions to stance dynamics are preserved,
enabling accurate deadbeat control.
2) Initialization of Actuator with Ramp Input: In order to
use the entirety of the stance phase for energy regulation,
we propose to incorporate an “initialization” phase for the
actuator immediately after touchdown, until it reaches the
position required by (14). In particular, we use
u
r
(t)=? sign(d?d
?
)(y?y
0
), (20)
which is zero at touchdown, and thanks to its monotony,
catches up with the ideal actuator position command within
the compression phase. The parameter ? can easily chosen
be chosen such that |˙ u(t)| < ˙ u
max
throughout compression
since ˙ y(t)willbemonotonicallyincreasing.Interestingly,this
initialization phase corresponds to a lossy SLIP model with
a different stiffness whose dynamics take the form
¨ y=?g?
k
m
(1?? sign(d?d
?
))(y?y
0
)?
d
m
˙ y, (21)
which are the same as those of the VD-SLIP model, making
the analytic solutions of Sec. II-B immediately usable. The
only challenge is to ﬁnd the transition time t
sw
such that
u
r
(t
sw
) = u
e
(t
sw
), which is also relatively straightforward
thanks to the analytic nature of solutions in both cases. The
composition of solutions for this initialization phase with the
rest of the stance yields an analytic return map, on which the
gait controller of Sec. II-D can be applied. Fig. 3 shows an
example simulation as the dashed magenta line showing the
ramp-up initialization method in comparison with others.
III. CONTROLLER PERFORMANCE AND EFFICIENCY
In this section, we present a comparative study of the
energetic performance and controller accuracy for gait con-
trol methods we described in Sec. II. We ﬁrst evaluate the
energetic effectiveness of all four methods in Sec. III-A
based on the maximum amount of energy they can inject
into the system within a single stride. We then investigate
the accuracy of single-stride deadbeat control in Sec. III-B.
Finally,wecomparepowerrequirementsofthesemethodson
the actuator, establishing that the tunable damping methods
allow platform designs with smaller actuators and better
efﬁciency. All our simulation results in this section consider
a human-sized platform with y
0
=1m and m=70kg.
A. Effectiveness of Energy Input
One of the physical constraints associated with robot
designs using a linear actuator in series with the leg spring
is the limited range of displacements for the actuator. In this
section, we establish upper bounds on the amount of energy
that can be injected into the VA-SLIP system using all four
control methods described in Sec. II by considering only the
range constraint|u(t)|<u
max
, assuming that the actuator can
otherwise supply required forces and velocities.

height was computed for each controller enforcing |u(t)|<
u
max
, and the results were averaged for different physical
damping coefﬁcients in the range d ? [100,500]Ns/m. As
expected, the stiffness controller has the lowest energy
injection performance since it is limited to decompression
and requires a large initial displacement. For similar rea-
sons, the decompression-only damping controller is limited
in its energy injection capability. However, both the ideal
damping controller and the ramp-up damping have similar
performance, with up to 1m height gain in a single stride,
showingthattheycaneffectivelyusetheentirestridetoinject
energy into the system for the best effectiveness.
B. Accuracy of Deadbeat Control
Having established that the ramp-up damping controller
outperforms its alternatives in being able to supply the most
energy within a single stride, we now investigate its accuracy
when additional actuator limitations described in Sec. II-F
are introduced. To this end, we use a maximum actuator ve-
locity of ˙ u
max
=2m/s and a maximum force of F
max
=10kN,
motivated by motor choices in the ATRIAS 2.1 robot scaled
to the size and weight of our platform. We run simulations
covering initial conditions and spring stiffnesses in the same
ranges as Sec. III-A, while considering height difference
commands in the range ?y:= y

?y(0)? [?0.5,0.5]m. We
evaluate controller performance with a percentage error,

Our results show that the accuracy of the stiffness con-
troller is the worst since it requires a step change at bottom
which is impossible to realize with realistic actuators. The
bottom instant is also when the spring force is largest,
challenging the actuator’s power constraints. Similarly, since
the ideal damping controller also assumes a discontinuous
actuator position at touchdown, its accuracy worsens as
the desired height difference increases. Damping control
limited to decompression does well in a certain range, until
its demand on the actuator speed exceeds practical limits
beyond which its performance degrades substantially. Since
the ramp-up damping controller eliminates discontinuities in
the desired actuator position and spreads out energy pumping
throughout the entire stance, its accuracy remains consis-
tently low for a large range of desired height differences.
Finally, it is informative to note that when the desired height
difference is close to ?0.35m, the physical damping in the
system does most of the work, eliminating the need for
explicit control and increasing the accuracy of all controllers.
C. Actuator Power Requirements
Finally, this section presents improvements in actuator
power requirements under each of the four different gait
control methods. To this end, we focus on a single choice of
leg parameters with k=10000N/m and d =100Ns/m, using
an initial robot height of y(0) = 1.6m with different com-
manded height differences in the range ?y? [?0.5,0.5]m.
Actuator limits were chosen to be the same as Sec. III-B,
with maximum and average power requirements through the

Fig. 6. Dependence of average (top) and maximum (bottom) actuator
power on the commanded height difference for four different controllers.
Simulations were run for a particular leg with k = 10000N/m and d =
100Ns/m and an initial height y(0)=1.6m.
Our results show that the stiffness control has the highest
power requirements as expected, attempting to inject most
of the energy at bottom where the spring force is largest.
The damping adjustment limited to decompression performs
better but still has substantial power requirements. The ideal
damping control and the ramp-up damping perform best,
with a dramatic reduction in power requirements for small
changes in apex height, until the actuator saturates altogether
beyond ?y>0.5m. Note, also, that the natural damping in
the system around ?y≈?0.25m eliminates the need for any
4560
actuation, which is why power requirements on the actuator
all vanish at that point.
These comparative results show that the novel gait control
method we proposed through active tuning of the system’s
damping coefﬁcient has the best performance in terms of
effective energy injection, controller accuracy and power
requirements. As such, it provides a robust, effective and
accurate method for controlling running behaviors.
IV. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we introduced a new control strategy for
runningrobotsthatincorporatealinearactuatorinserieswith
thelegcompliance.Ourstrategyisbasedontuningthedamp-
ing of a virtual unactuated leg attached to the robot body,
preserving the spring-mass-damper structure and solutions
of radial SLIP dynamics [11]. We present our derivations
and controller design on a simpler, vertical model, noting
that they can readily be extended to planar running models.
Our simulation studies show that the proposed strategy and
its extensions to address physical considerations yield more
efﬁcient energy injection within a stride, smaller power
requirements on the actuator and better control accuracy
under physical actuator limitations in comparison to an
alternative control strategy that relies on active regulation
of leg stiffness.
We expect to verify our results on an experimental plat-
form in the near future. In the long term, we believe that
this method will provide a sufﬁciently efﬁcient and accurate
control strategy for locomotion to support physical imple-
mentations of model-based adaptive control, state estimation
and reactive footstep planning algorithms.
