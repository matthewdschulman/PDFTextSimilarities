Abstract— In order to define meaningful limit values for 
human-robot collisions, we have come to the conclusion that 
only comprehensive collision tests with live test subjects will 
successfully lead to verified limit values. A literature survey 
about current approaches for limiting the consequences of 
hazardous contacts between humans and moving machines 
(including robots) showed that limit values are often specified 
without an appropriate injury severity or without considering 
the variety of the human body. In this article, we show why the 
injury onset is appropriate to limit the consequences of human-
robot collisions, and how this onset can be quantified through 
collision tests with live test subjects. With our work we would 
like to present a promising method that can remedy the current 
lack of consensus regarding an appropriate injury severity and 
verified limit values. 
I. PREFACE 
Industrial workplaces with physical Human-Robot 
Interaction (pHRI) have been increasing recently. In general, 
such settings pose a significant risk for the human’s health, 
since collisions with the robot cannot be avoided completely. 
In the last decade, collisions between robots and humans 
were studied in various experiments and simulations. The 
most comprehensive studies were carried out by the German 
Aerospace Center (DLR), which, for instance, analyzed the 
characteristics of human-robot collision through experiments 
with crash-test dummies [1] [2] [3] [4]. Other research 
groups, which are also noteworthy in this context, used stress 
tests with live test subjects to study the maximum operation 
conditions of collaborative robots in order to limit the 
consequences of unintended contact on pain-related levels [5] 
[6]. 
In accordance to these studies, we have come to the 
conclusion that only comprehensive stress tests with live test 
subjects will successfully lead to verified limit values. In this 
article we will present a new approach on how blunt impacts 
can be quantified by performing experimental collision tests 
with live test subjects, and, therefore, how a specific 
threshold can be provided with verified limit values. This is 
an extension of our previous activities in the field of human-
robot collisions whereby we analyzed the correlation between 
constrained and unconstrained impacts [7]. During this study 
we developed an experimental test-rig that allowed for 
performing collision test with live test subjects. As we will 
show later, this set-up was used in our present work to 
quantify critical thresholds for blunt robot-human collisions.

In Section II we give a brief overview of the most recent 
approaches for determining appropriate thresholds that define 
the maximal consequences of hazardous contacts with 
moving machines like collaborative robots. In Section III we 
introduce the field of blunt impact injuries in order to provide 
an understanding of this field, their related effects, and the 
processes involved. The experimental design, methodology, 
and first results of our study are presented in Section IV. 
Finally, we conclude our work in Section VI and give a brief 
outlook regarding our further work on this topic. 
II. COLLISIONS AND THEIR ALLOWABLE CONSEQUENCES 
There are several approaches for defining the allowable 
consequences of hazardous contact situations between 
humans and moving machines. In this chapter we summarize 
the most recent approaches and their corresponding limit 
values. Our solution to overcome the gap between verified 
limit values and a corresponding injury severity is then 
presented in the last part of this section. 
A. Critical consequences of collisions in pHRI 
The discussion about the critical consequences of an 
impact in robotics arose as the demand for pHRI in 
manufacturing has increased. There are currently a variety of 
different notions on what critical or still-allowable 
consequences of contacts between humans and robots could 
be and there is no clear consensus. The most common 
approaches are summarized below. 
Pain: The pioneering work of Yoji Yamada introduces 
the pain tolerance limit as the critical stress for humans which 
may arise during a collision with a robot [5]. A similar 
approach is followed in [6]. The pain entrance level is 
currently examined by the University Medical Center of the 
Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz (JGU Mainz) in a 
current study that was initiated by the German employers' 
liability insurance association (BG). In this study the pain 
onset of 100 subjects is being examined at 29 well-distributed 
body locations through the use of a pain algometer [9]. Note, 
that pain entrance is different from pain tolerance. Pain 
entrance expresses the minimum stimulus inducing pain, 
while pain tolerance refers to the maximum intensity of 
stimulus tolerated [8]. 
Injury: The Institute for Occupational Safety and Health 
of the German Social Accident Insurance (IFA) 
recommended that all injuries can be considered as 
acceptable if the severity doesn’t exceed a contusion without 
skin opening and fractures as included by AIS1 of the 
Abbreviated Injury Scale or superficial injuries of the ICD-10 
classification [10]. A similar approach was presented by the 
Study on meaningful and verified Thresholds 
for minimizing the Consequences of Human-Robot Collisions

DLR that considers a contusion without skin opening as 
appropriate for human-robot collisions [11]. A precise 
specification of this trauma is provided by the AO 
Classification for fracture description of the human skeleton. 
B. Limit values of collisions in pHRI and machinery safety 
In order to limit the consequences of unintended and 
hazardous contacts to machines on a specific level, 
independently of what is finally considered as acceptable, the 
introduction of biomechanical and/or operational limit values 
is necessary. The most recent limit values are summarized 
below. 
Standards: There are several standards about machinery 
safety, which are specifying limitation quantities to minimize 
the injury risk of mechanical hazards like collisions. The 
most frequently used quantities and their associated values 
are summarized in Table I. As the summary shows, most of 
the reviewed standards define neither an injury severity nor a 
body location for the specified threshold values. Furthermore, 
there is no information whether the specified values were 
verified or not. 
Pre-standards: A standard on testing body impact 
protection equipment, that has currently draft status, 
differentiates between severe and slight injuries. A total of 
eleven body regions are taken into account for which, 
depending on the injury severity, specific force limit values 
are provided. The limit values were gathered from literature 
of different research sectors and first published in the HSE 
report RR906 [20]. Another detailed list of biomechanical 
limit values can be found in a recommendation of the IFA 
[10]. In contrast to all other references, this list is set up in a 
highly differentiating manner by regarding force and pressure 
as relevant quantities for limiting the effects of collisions. 
Furthermore, a well-structured body model is used to allocate 
three specific limit values for each of 15 body regions. The 
authors gathered all values from a comprehensive literature 
survey.

Robotic research: The focus in the most-recent work of 
the DLR [11] was not about which values cause specific 
injury, but rather about the parameters of moving rigid 
objects. Here the parameters velocity, reflected mass and 
shape of the contact area are taken into account. In a variety 
of drop tests, speed limiting functions were determined by 
using porcine abdomen flesh, which has characteristics 
similar to human abdomen tissue. The result shows a clear 
dependency between injury severity and the parameters of the 
dropped impactor.

All limit values summarized in Table I and II, have one 
essential disadvantage in common: their validity was never 
verified with living humans. Neither single subject tests nor 
tests with high statistical significance were carried out. Thus 
there is no certainty regarding the correlation of the defined 
collision consequences (if defined) and their related limit 
values. In our opinion the lack of unverified limit values is 
the main reason why none of all available approaches and 
their limit values were adopted for pHRI, and, therefore, 
safety in pHRI will remain an uncertain issue. 
C. Approach and contribution of our work 
The available approaches for classifying the allowable 
consequences of hazardous contacts range from using pain 
entrance to minor injuries, which, for instance, can be 
classified by AIS1, as criteria. We expect that the pain onset 
is not a suitable measure to define threshold values since it 
will provide significantly low force and pressure values, 
which would further result in slow and less useful robot 
velocities. On the other hand we consider minor injuries as 
classified by AIS1 to be too severe, since AIS1 includes per 
definition, a mortality rate of 7‰ and one broken rib [21]. In 
our opinion, neither the former nor the latter injury is 
acceptable in the sense of pHRI. The pain tolerance level 
introduced by Yoji Yamada [5] seems to be a promising 
approach that should be further pursued. However, it is not 
clear whether a serious correlation between pain tolerance 
and injury exist or not. In this case there is only one of the 
presented severity approaches left: mild contusions without 
skin opening and without fractures. In order to accept this as 
the allowable injury severity for human-robot collisions, it is 
crucial to limit their degree according to a number of 
concrete phenomena. We discussed this issue intensively 
with experts for occupational safety and physicians from 
different specialist areas. We concluded that the acceptable 
degree should only appear as an edema (commonly known as 
a bump) and a bruise, which can be, from a medical 
perspective, considered as harmless, since the healing process 
of these injuries generally ends without permanent 
consequences. 
3379
  
Although biomechanical research focuses a great deal of 
attention on human tolerance testing, almost no substantial 
information could be found in the area of contusion 
thresholds. Only one article was found that gives insights into 
contusions and their formation due to dynamic impacts [22]. 
III. BLUNT IMPACT TRAUMA 
In medical terminology, a hazardous collision between 
humans and blunt objects that causes injuries without skin 
penetration is denoted as a blunt impact trauma. The 
appearance of injuries resulting from blunt impact trauma is 
determined by the physical characteristics of the moving 
object which collides with the human body, and the specific 
body location. The resulting injury is in part due to the ability 
of the moving object to displace tissue with high velocities. 
The substantial injury causing factors are the total amount of 
energy discharged, the time in which the energy is 
discharged, and the area over which the energy is released 
[23] [24].

Figure 1.  Selected locations for examination of mild contuison thresholds  
The typical phenomena of mild contusion are edema and 
bruises, whose appearance essentially depends on the 
intensity of the blunt force trauma. The initial reaction to 
blunt trauma impact is dilatation of capillaries that further 
reduces the flow of blood. In addition, the permeability of the 
capillaries increases whereby plasma passes into the 
traumatized tissue and fibrin occludes the lumen of 
lymphatics. These processes result in the swelling of the 
traumatized localization. When the impact intensity is higher, 
both in terms of force and/or energy discharged, the 
underlying blood vessels are lacerated microscopically and a 
visible bruise forms. The appearance of the bruise is 
determined by the amount of bleeding, the type of tissue, the 
depth at which the bleeding originates, and the time of 
clotting. Typically, both the dermis and the subcutaneous 
tissue, with possible extension into superficial layer of 
muscle, are affected through the impact [23] [24] [25]. 
As shown by the DLR, a collision with a complex robotic 
system can be reduced to a rigid object that is characterized 
by the parameters velocity v
0
, mass m, and surface shape S 
[11]. These parameters can be considered as relevant injury-
causing factors. According to [22] further quantities 
including maximum contact force F , maximum pressure ?, 
impulse p, absorbed energy ¢Wand density of the absorbed 
energy d
¢W
 should also be considered, because it is not yet 
clear if these quantities have an essential influence on blunt 
impact trauma. 
IV. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN 
This section provides all information about the 
experimental design including the setup, used methods and 
the medical accompaniment. 
A. Ethics 
Ethical approval for this study was obtained from the 
Ethical Committee of the Otto von Guericke University in 
Magdeburg. The study was deemed acceptable since the 
impact tests have “minimal risk”. The experimental set-up 
and the continuous medical accompaniment of our study 
were important factors in obtaining the positive evaluation. 
B. Subjects 
For the preliminary phase of the study we selected three 
locations on the left arm for examining collision as shown in 
Figure 1. These locations are the most exposed parts of the 
human body and therefore, have a high probability of being 
involved in a collision. Altogether we acquired four subjects 
(one female, three males, age 28:8§2:1, weight 
(73:3§5:8)kg, height (1:79§0:05)m). 
C. Experimental setup 
The experimental setup is illustrated in Figure 2. It 
consists of a coupled pendulum hanging from a stiff frame 
{1}. In front of the frame, a stiff rack {2} is installed to 
fasten the body parts of the subjects before inducing impacts. 
Additional fixing devices {3} and a vacuum mat {4} are used 
to keep the subjects in position and to minimize evasive 
movements. The pendulum body itself consists of a ram {5} 
and an impactor {6} located on the front side. Altogether, 
three impactors of different shapes are available as shown by 
Figure 3. A mounting device is provided to increase the 
effective mass {7} of the ram body in discrete steps.  In the 
preliminary phase of our study we used only two different 
masses. Each mass includes the permanent weight of the 
pendulum (? 1:36kg) and additional weights that were 
mounted on the ram. In order to determine the exact 
pendulum inertia, we carried out an experiment where the 
oscillating motion of the loaded pendulum was measured. 
Afterwards, the pendulum parameters, namely inertia and 
damping coefficient, were determined by fitting a model of 
the pendulum on the measurement acquired in the oscillation 
experiment. This approach yields for both masses 4:16kg 
and 8:65kg respectively, which are typical for small 
collaborative robots like the LWR of the DLR [24]. A 
locking mechanism {8} at the back side of the pendulum 
frame is provided to fix and release the deflected ram. The 
maximally adjustable deflection corresponds with a collision 
velocity of approximately 1:25m=s.

A piezo-electric load-cell is used to measures the impact

=10kHz and a resolution of 
16bit. All all impactors are covered with a pressure sensor 
from TekScan {3} that samples at a rate of f
S
=1:3kHz. 
D. Experimental methods 
Collision tests with different impact energies (mass and 
collision velocity are adjustable) and impactor shapes are the 
key elements of our work for determining the threshold of 
mild contusions. Our approach includes the application of 
impact energies upon selected body locations until a critical 
consequence occurs, in particular the appearance of an edema 
or a bruise, and the perception of intolerable pain. The pain 
tolerance level must be taken into account, because it is not 
ethically acceptable to subject the volunteers above theirs 
individual pain tolerance. During a collision test all relevant 
quantities (the contact force, the pressure within the contact 
area and the pendulum motion) are measured.

Figure 3.  Available impactors 
The entire experimental procedure is illustrated in Figure 
4. Note that any initial session will always start with the 
highest mass as highlighted green in the illustration. This 
allows for a systematic coverage of the available energy 
spectrum with a minimal number of sessions. Whenever a 
critical consequence occurs and there are still available 
masses left, it is necessary to wait fourteen days until the 
stressed body part is healed and therefore the examination 
can be continued [25]. Otherwise, without any injury-related 
evidences, a relaxation time of seven days is considered as 
sufficient. The collision velocity is given by the deflection of 
the pendulum and the position when the pendulum collides 
with volunteer. Since it is hardly possible to position the 
volunteer in front of the pendulum so that the impact is 
induced at the zero crossing point of the pendulum ' = 0, 
the collision velocity cannot adjusted on specific values 
precisely. Figure 5 shows the real test-rig and a collision test. 
E. Medical accompaniment 
Each subject needed to pass a comprehensive assessment 
of their physical condition that was conducted by trauma 
surgeons, which are highly experienced in the effects of 
cardiovascular disorders. They took an anamnesis and 
evaluated essential body functions such as clotting time, heart 
rhythm, sense of balance, etc. Only when no health-related 
concerns and risks were diagnosed, were the respective 
subjects considered acceptable for the study. Furthermore, 
ultrasound images of the selected target locations were 
recorded by dermatologists in order to document the initial 
state. 
A physician is present the entire time during a collision 
test to ensure quick initiation of medical countermeasures 
should any complications arise. Directly after the collision 
test the stressed body part of the subject is examined and 
photographically documented. Meanwhile, the subject 
recorded its sensed pain on a five-step perception scale. All 
diagnostic results will be documented in a report. This short 
examination is followed by another one, which takes places 
six hours after the collision test. This waiting time 
corresponds to the time period in which any possible swelling 
would appear [25]. During the follow-up examination a 
visual and ultrasound diagnosis of the stressed body locations 
was made.

B. Medical examination 
During the collision tests, two subjects developed a 
visible bruise at location {2} (upper arm). At the same 
location one subject got a bruise and remarked that the 
perceived pain reached his/her tolerance level denoted by a 
value of 5 within a pain scale from 1 (no pain) to 5 
(intolerable). The pain tolerance level of 5 was reached at the 
locations {1} (lower arm) and {2} (upper arm) in three 
separate tests. At location {3} (shoulder), none of the 
participating subjects have yet to reach their pain tolerance 
levels or have been bruised.

The ultrasound examination was accomplished after each 
session at all stressed body locations in order to diagnose a 
subcutaneous edema and/or bruise. Unfortunately, we came 
to the result that the resolution of the available ultrasound 
scanner is insufficient for identifying slight bruises and 
edemas clearly. One bruise, which could be diagnosed by 
ultrasound, is shown in Figure 6.

VI. CONCLUSION AND FURTHER WORK 
A literature survey in the field of machinery and robotics 
safety showed that limit values are often specified without 
any appropriate injury severity or without considering the 
variety of the human body with locations of totally different 
characteristics. In the robotics community there are 
promising approaches to specify limit values in consensus 
with specific consequences, which are considered as tolerable 
or critical.  In our opinion none of these approaches are 
adequate enough since their limit values have not been 
verified with living humans or their corresponding 
consequences leading to inefficient operation conditions 
(slow and less useful robot velocities) or have no statistical 
relevance. To overcome all these lacks we have begun a 
comprehensive study with the goal to define an appropriate 
injury severity for pHRI from an occupational safety 
perspective. Through consultation with physicians and 
experts for occupational safety we propose that mild 
contusions including the appearance of an edema or a bruise 
should be the maximum injury severity for pHRI. We have 
presented how this threshold can be backed up with verified 
limit values, which in turn are obtained through experimental 
collision tests with live test subjects. The promising results 
gathered during the preliminary phase of the study turn out 
that our approach has great potential to contribute the current 
standardization efforts in pHRI. 
Up to now, it is not clear which quantity has the most 
relevant influence on injuries due to blunt impacts. This is the 
primary objective of the following phase of our study in 
which we plan to examine more subjects at five locations by
