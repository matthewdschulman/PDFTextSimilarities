Abstract—Motivated by the needs to develop dexterous 
flexonic mobile node (FMN) for structural health monitoring 
where obstacle avoidance is among the most challenging tasks, 
this paper presents a novel FMN design for navigating on 
iron-based structures. Unlike most existing magnetic wheel 
designs, the FMN uses fixed-magnet configuration contributing 
to smooth motion, self-maintained orientation and automatic 
negotiation of concave corners.  Taking into account of several 
stringent considerations (including tight dimension, efficient 
attachment and manipulation flexibility) to facilitate avoidance 
of structural obstacles in tight space, a prototype FMN 
incorporating a compliant beam (that results in more DOFs 
than designs with multiple links and pin/ball joints), along with 
a 3-step strategy for negotiating a convex corner, has been 
developed.  Although controlling a continuous deforming beam 
is challenging given limited number of actuators, both 
simulation and experimental results confirm a simple 
input/output relation between the rear axle displacement and 
front axle rotation, which is anticipated to facilitate control 
implementation of FMN for obstacle avoidance. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
n recent years, wireless sensor networks have grown to be a 
practical and promising approach for civil structural health 
monitoring (SHM) [1, 2].  In a mobile sensor network, each 
node is a sensor-carrying robot capable of autonomous 
navigation and wireless communication with peers. Given the 
complicated civil structures (with corners, steps, reinforced 
ridges, etc.), a mobile robot must embody a flexible structure 
for negotiating various obstacles and for attaching/detaching 
a sensor onto/from ferromagnetic surfaces as well as perform 
other potential functions for SHM applications[3, 4]. Inspired 
by biological limbs (such as octopus tentacles and elephant 
trunks) that enable many animals the capabilities of dexterous 
locomotion and compliant manipulation, researchers have 
been developing flexible robots featuring compliant beams 
for continuous bending and twisting[5-9]. However, it is a 
challenging task to design and control a compliant beam 
subjected to nonlinear deformations with kinematic

redundancy in the three-dimensional (3D) space. There is a 
need for an efficient method for designing flexible robots, 
which describes all state variables in a global coordinate 
while accounting for both focal and distributed loadings 
along the beam. This is achieved by derivation based on 
curvatures, which is inherent to geometry and independent of 
coordinate frames. For this reason, the method is named as 
curvature-based beam model (CBM), which is used for 
designing and controlling a novel robot with a flexible 
structure referred to here as a “flexonic mobile node” (FMN). 
Unlike rigid configurations with a fixed distance between the 
front and rear axles of a car-like robot, the FMN features 
various deformable configurations in the 3D space by 
incorporating a compliant beam (connecting the front and 
rear axles with a controlled pin joint) and thus enabling it to 
flexibly navigate on ferromagnetic structures. 
It has been widely accepted that mimicking morphology of 
animals/insects is beneficial to the design of autonomous 
robots [10]. To accomplish agile and dexterous motions, 
researchers have to employ various types of joints and 
actuators, as well as complicated sensory feedback control 
loops. With typical actuators in mind, additional degrees of 
freedom (DOFs) usually require more 
actuators/sensors/batteries, which would result in bulky and 
chunky robot bodies and hence increased robot inertia with 
compromised agility. With elegant designs and advanced 
control techniques, hyper-redundant robots are fabricated as a 
flexible structure consists of a series of actuated joints to 
emulate motions of snakes [11, 12] and lampreys [13]. 
However, redundant designs are hard to realize on small scale. 
To reduce the number of actuators while maintaining the 
characteristic of flexibilities, researchers have been using 
smart materials, such as the ionic conducting polymer film 
(ICPF) and the ionic polymer-metal composite (IPMC) for a 
fish-like micro robot [14, 15]. Recently, a new medical device 
of active cannula comprising of super-elastic concentric tubes 
[16, 17] has been designed. Due to the features of continuous 
bending and twisting, they are also known as flexible robots. 
Their designs with conventional actuators and commercially 
available elastic materials (such as linear/rotational motors 
and Nitinol) have brought up the question on how to control a 
mechanism with continuous large deformation using very few 
actuator inputs. This paper intends to provide a preliminary 
answer to this question from the viewpoint of designing and 
modeling of an FMN.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: 
? Robot design concepts for obstacle avoidance are 
developed and analyzed from three aspects of dimension, 
attachment and flexibility, based on which an FMN is 
designed with a compliant beam and fixed arc magnet 
configuration. 
? With the application of SHM [6, 18, 19] in mind, typical 
structural obstacles are considered as combinations of two 
basic corner types, and corresponding avoidance 
strategies are developed.  
? To validate the proposed navigation strategy, both 
experiment and simulation are carried out for the FMN 
and the matched result suggests a simple displacement 
control for structural obstacle avoidance. 
II. DESIGN CONCEPTS 
Fig. 1 shows a network of autonomous robots, which are 
capable of carrying smart sensors and navigating on civil 
structures for health monitoring. Each robot is featured with 
small size, magnetic attachment and compliant mechatronics. 
Its front axle and rear axle are connected by a compliant beam, 
through which it can load/unload a sensor on the working 
surface and negotiate corners with various poses, so it is 
named as the flexonic mobile node (FMN).

As civil structures are built with established engineering 
criterions and standards, a field robot to navigate on these 
structures should be designed under certain guidelines, which 
can be categorized into the following topics of dimensions, 
attachment and flexibility. Along the discussion of these 
guidelines, the design concepts of the FMN are also 
delivered.  
A. Dimension 
Dimension of a field robot is obviously critical to its design 
of mechanical and electrical components. However, it is even 
more important to the function of obstacle avoidance. Fig. 2 
shows a schematic of a general robot (either wheeled or 
legged) to overcome an obstacle, where the featured 
dimensions of the robot and the obstacle are denoted as R and 
H, respectively. In this way, the robot can be considered as a 
sphere of radius R, and it is subjected to a virtual pushing 
force F from motors or actuators. When the force can provide 
enough positive torque F(R-H), the robot can overcome the 
obstacle. In this way, if R is much larger than H, it is very easy 
to climb the step as shown in Fig. 2(a). However, if R is close 
to H, or in other words, the robot is about the same size as an 
obstacle, it tends to be trapped as shown in Fig. 2(b). Also, if 
R is much smaller than H, then the task can be divided into a 
sequence of typical obstacle avoidance motions, such as 
negotiating concave and convex corners in Fig. 2(c). Of 
course, an attaching force would be required for certain 
motions, such as climbing, to compensate for the gravity.

With typical obstacles in mind, it is reasonable to design a 
robot either much larger or much smaller than the featured 
dimension of the obstacles. For SHM, an extremely big robot 
would be too heavy, energy inefficient and risky. Since the 
width and length of general trusses is larger than 15cm and 
200cm, one axle of the FMN is designed as compact as about 
8cm? 8cm? 8cm. In this way, navigation on complicated truss 
structures can be achieved with strategies developed for 
overcoming simple obstacles.  
B. Attachment 
Permanent magnets are employed to provide attraction 
forces to attach the FMN onto an iron surface. The novel 
concept of the fixed magnet configuration is developed from 
the general design of alternative rotating magnets. Fig. 3(a) 
shows one of the traditional magnetic wheels, where thin 
rectangular magnets envelop a solid cylinder with their 
magnetization axes arranged alternatively pointing towards 
and outwards from the wheel center. However, the new 
configuration fixes the magnet on the frame (Fig. 3b), so that 
the robot moves with the externally rotating wheel by only 
compensating for the friction; while in the design of rotating 
magnets, the wheel embodies a polygon profile and the 
driving force has to compensate for the magnetic force, which 
is much larger than the friction. As the polygon wheel moves 
on a surface, its center vibrates vertically because of the 
varying rotation radius. This dynamics contributes to the 
tilting of the robot frame body (Fig. 3b), which deteriorates 
the performance of the onboard sensors such as the image 
processing unit. In this way, the supporting columns have to 
be added to maintain the frame orientation. But the fixed 
magnet configuration can naturally maintain its pose in a 
similar manner as a tumbler, thus can perform much smoother 
motions.

By realizing the concept of fixed magnet configuration, Fig. 
4 shows the mechanical structure of the FMN. Two arc 
magnets, which are radially magnetized in the opposite 
directions, are fixed with the frame body through the guards 
(radius is 30 mm). Each of the hollow wheels (inner and outer 
radii are 31 mm and 32.5 mm, respectively) is independently 
driven by one DC motor. As a magnetic force decreases 
dramatically with distance, the gap between the magnets and 
the surface is designed to be about 3.5 mm. Also, an iron plate 
is added to increase the wheel attraction force by forming a 
closed-loop of magnetic flux. After assembled with the 
electronic components, the overall weight of one axle is 
measured as about 0.4 kg, which is mainly contributed by the 
motors, batteries and magnets as main parts of the FMN are 
made of Delrin.. So a robot design with the fixed magnet 
configuration is anticipated to be lighter than that using many 
magnets in the traditional configuration.

C. Flexibility 
A field robot is desired to be as flexible as possible to 
negotiate various types of obstacles, implying the more 
degrees of freedom (DOFs) the better. A four-wheel robot is 
used as a comparison platform for different design 
configurations. Assuming the robot is self-balanced with 
fixed magnets as proposed in the previous section, the rear 
axle embodies 2 DOFs as it can move forward/backward and 
make turns on a plane. In the following, the front axle relative 
motion is analyzed for four design configurations and their 
total DOFs are summarized in Table I: 
- DC1 (Link): When connected with a rigid link, the front 
axle has no relative motion to the rear axles. 
- DC2 (Pin joint): The added pin joint allows the front axle 
to rotate with respect to the rear axle. The rotation 
direction depends on the pin axis orientation. 
- DC3 (Ball joint): The front axle is able to rotate in the 3D 
space with a ball joint characterized by yawing, pitching 
and rolling. However, the rotation range is limited, and the 
distance between the two axles is uniquely determined 
once the front axle orientation is known. 
- DC4 (Compliant beam): By connecting with a compliant 
beam subject to both bending and twisting, the front axle 
is capable of both rotation and translation in the 3D space, 
and the rotation range is much larger than DC3. It is noted 
that the compliant beam can have infinite number of 
deformed shapes, which has not been accounted in this 
analysis.

III. OBSTACLE AVOIDANCE 
With typical engineering components in mind, geometries 
of most structural obstacles are combinations of different 
surfaces. So obstacle avoidance of an FMN can be achieved 
by navigating from one plane to another. This can be 
decoupled into two basic strategies of corner negotiation. 
A. Convex Corner 
Fig. 5 shows an FMN crossing a convex corner A from 
plane I to plane II. The reference frame XYZ is defined such 
that axis Z is normal to the plane I where the FMN initially 
locates and axis X is normal to the corner edge. Similarly, the 
frame X?Y?Z? is obtained by rotating the frame XYZ with 
respect to the axis Y so that Z? is normal to the plane II. 
Because of limited turning space, the FMN changes its 
initially aligned front and rear axles by turning the front axle 
(equivalent to a rigid body with mass m
1
 and mass center C
1
, 
and the wheel radius is r
w
) and deforming the compliant beam.

 are attached to the

0
 and x
1
 are along the beam 
axis while z
0
 and z
1
 are normal to the beam surface, so they 
characterize positions and orientations of both ends, 
respectively.  
The strategy for the FMN to negotiate a convex corner with 
limited turning space comprises three steps:  
5129
  
Step 1: The rear axle turns so that the front axle can 
approach the edge perpendicularly, where ? is the angle 
between X and x
0
. Afterwards the rear axle pushes forwards 
by u
0
 along x
0
, exerting forces F
1
 and torque M
1
 through the 
compliant beam to rotate the front axle about A by ? which is 
determined by the angle formed by the axes Z and z
1
. 
Step 2: Right after the front axle crosses over the corner, 
the two axle move together.   
Step 3: As soon as the rear axle reaches the corner, it is 
pulled over by the front axle via the compliant beam. 
Step 1 is detailed in the following as the success of the 
convex corner negotiation in the 3D space is dictated by this 
initiation, which differs from the 2D case as presented in 
previous research [6]. In Fig. 5, N is the normal force acting 
on both wheels of  the front axle; f (=?N) is the friction; ? is 
the coefficient of friction between the wheel and the ground; 
and M
m
 is the torque provided by the front axle motors. The 
following assumptions are made in this discussion:  
1) The magnetic wheels are designed as in Section IIB so 
that the FMN is attached on the steel surfaces as it moves. 
2) The non-slip condition is satisfied:

3) Because the magnets are very close to the surface, the 
moment arm is very small, thus the magnetic torque is 
negligible as compared to that due to gravity.

equations are formulated in vector forms, so they are valid for

Motions of the FMN can be simulated by solving the 3D 
compliant beam governing equations (Appendix) with 
boundary conditions provided by (3) and (4). Fig. 6 illustrates

B. Concave Corner 
Compared to the 3-step strategy to negotiate convex 
corners with limited space, concave corner negotiation is 
much simpler because it is automated in nature by the fixed 
magnet configuration as illustrated in Fig. 7. Considering 
only one axle approaching the corner on the plane I, it is 
driven by the motor torque M
m
 as given by (1). Once the 
wheels push against the plane II, the axle could not move any 
further and the wheels get stuck (Fig. 7a). As the wheels do 
not rotate, the frame would be subjected to the reaction torque 
from the wheels, which is equal to –M
m
. Although the 
magnetic forces are very large to attach the robot to any iron 
surface, the magnetic torque is actually smaller than the 
motor torque, thus the frame starts to rotate as shown in Fig. 
7b. After the magnets get released from the plane I and 
attracted to the plane II, the axle can continue moving and the 
task of concave corner negotiation is achieved.

IV. EXPERIMENT AND RESULTS 
The proposed design concepts of FMN are realized as 
shown in Fig. 8. One end of the beam is rigidly fixed on the 
rear axle frame while the other end is pinned and coupled with 
a slider. As the pin moves to the right end (Fig. 8a), the beam 
5130
  
front edge pushes against the front axle and is locked as 
fixation. When the pin is at the other end, there is a gap 
between the beam front edge and back of the front axle, 
allowing for free rotation between them and facilitating 
in-plane turning without twisting the beam. Besides, 
electronic components of image processing and wireless 
communication are also implemented on the FMN prototype 
for application of SHM.

The objectives of the experiment are as follows: 
1) The first objective is to validate the proposed obstacle 
avoidance strategy for convex corner negotiation, where 
the pushing angle varies from 0º to 60º . 
2) The second is to validate the theoretical model for corner 
negotiation based on a compliant beam by comparing 
simulation result against experiment. 
3) The third is to find a control method potentially effective to 
obstacle avoidance. Of particular interest is to determine 
the rear axle displacement u
0
 for a desired front axle 
rotation angle ?. 
Fig. 9 shows the experiment setup for the front axle to 
overcome a right corner on a steel structure. To accurately 
maintain the pushing angle ? and measure the rear axle 
displacement u
0
, the rear axle is replaced by a set of manual 
positioners. The translation stages in Part A are used to adjust 
the height of the compliant beam to obtain a horizontal initial 
state, while those in Part B measure the pushing displacement 
u
0
 from 0 to 75mm. The rotation stage in Part C is employed 
to manipulate ?, thus can change the direction of the 
complaint beam relative to the front axle.  
Snapshots of the front axle wheel are captured by a digital 
camera for each value of u
0
 as shown in Fig. 10(a), and the 
wheel center is calculated by image processing techniques. 
Then, the rotation angle ? of the front axle is obtained by the 
orientation of the line connecting the wheel center and the 
corner point. Since the simulation results for different ? are 
very close to each other, average of the simulation result is 
compared against the cases of ? increased from 0º to 60º with 
increment of 15º in Fig. 10(b). It is shown that simulation 
closely matches with the experiment results, although 
deviations exist for  ? = 0º and 30º . It is noted that errors may 
come from calculation of the required torque that involves 
determination of the assembly mass center. Another error 
source would be the image processing when the corner point 
is determined by manually picking one pixel, which gives rise 
to negative initial value of ?. Besides, it is obvious that the 
rotation angle ? is linear with the rear axle displacement u
0
 for 
different pushing angle ?, which potentially facilitate the 
control implementation for corner negotiation.

V. CONCLUSION 
Motivated by the application of structural health 
monitoring (SHM), this paper has proposed a flexonic mobile 
node (FMN) based on several design concepts from three 
aspects of dimension, attachment and flexibility. To facilitate 
structural obstacle avoidance, the dimension of the robot 
should be either much larger or much smaller than the 
targeted obstacles. A novel magnetic wheel configuration is 
developed by fixing arc magnets to the robot frame, which 
performs smoother motion than traditional design with 
rotating magnets. Also, this fixed magnet configuration is 
able to maintain the robot frame orientation and automate the 
concave corner negotiation. For the case of convex corner 
negotiation, a 3-step strategy is presented by incorporating a 
compliant beam (embodies more DOFs than links and 
pin/ball joints) , where both simulation and experiment results 
confirm a linear relation between the front axle rotation and 
rear axle displacement. As typical structural elements can be 
decoupled into convex and concave corners, the method 
developed in this paper can be readily used for structural 
obstacle avoidance.
