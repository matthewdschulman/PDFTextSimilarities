Analysis of the Inverse Kinematics Problem for 3-DOF Axis-Symmetric
Parallel Manipulators with Parasitic Motion
Mats Isaksson, Anders Eriksson and Saeid Nahavandi
AbstractÑ Determining an analytical solution to the inverse
kinematics problem for a parallel manipulator is typically
a straightforward problem. However, lower mobility parallel
manipulators with 2-5 degrees of freedom (DOFs) often suffer
from an unwanted parasitic motion in one or more DOFs.
For such manipulators, the inverse kinematics problem can
be signiÞcantly more difÞcult. This paper contains an analysis
of the inverse kinematics problem for a class of 3-DOF
parallel manipulators with axis-symmetric arm systems. All
manipulators in the studied class exhibit parasitic motion in
one DOF. For manipulators in the studied class, the general
solution to the inverse kinematics problem is reduced to solving
a univariate equation, while analytical solutions are presented
for several important special cases.
I. INTRODUCTION
The Þeld of kinematics is the study of motion without
considering the forces that cause the motion. Simply put, the
inverse kinematics (IK) problem means Þnding the actuated
joint angles of a manipulator, knowing the position and
orientation of its end-effector (EEF). For an industrial robot,
the main use of the IK is to calculate the joint angles corre-
sponding to a programmed path (positions and orientations)
of the EEF. In addition to that, the derived expressions are
useful for kinematic analysis of a manipulator, including
studies of its isotropy and stiffness.
The section of the workspace where solutions to the
IK exist is called the reachable workspace. The reachable
workspace is limited by the arm lengths of the manipulator,
joint limitations and collisions. If a solution does exist, it
may not be unique. The IK could have multiple or even
inÞnite solutions. The parallel manipulators (PMs) studied
here are typically designed so that only one solution to the
IK is valid. However, manipulators of the investigated type
could be designed with the possibility of utilising multiple
IK solutions. In [1], this possibility is explored for a 6-DOF
variant of the manipulators studied here.
It is often loosely stated that the IK problem is complex
for a serial manipulator (SM) whereas straightforward for a
PM. However, while this is often the case, several exceptions
exist. First of all, the IK for an SM does not have to be
complex. Consider for example a serial 6-DOF mechanism
whose base is attached to a 2-DOF joint with the same
functionality as a universal joint, except that both joint axes
are actuated. Assume this joint is connected to an actuated

telescopic link, which in turn is connected to a manipu-
lated platform via a 3-DOF joint with three concurrent and
perpendicular joint axes that are all actuated (kinematically
equivalent to a spherical joint). If the tool centre point (TCP)
is assumed to be in the joint axes intersection point of
the 3-DOF joint, the IK of this decoupled mechanism is
straightforward with only one possible solution. However,
for a typical 6-DOF serial industrial robot, the manipulator
DOFs are not decoupled, leading to a more complex IK
problem. For such manipulators, the solution for each joint
is typically dependent on the solution of other joints in the
kinematic chain and can not be determined independently.
Furthermore, such mechanisms typically feature multiple IK
solutions.
Similarly, the IK for a parallel robot is not always straight-
forward. As most deÞnitions of a parallel robot allows for
more than one actuated joint per kinematic chain, a 6-DOF
parallel robot may have as few as two kinematic chains and
one of these chains may include Þve actuated joints. In this
case, the complexity of the IK problem is similar to that of
a 5-DOF SM and hence more intricate. A redundant parallel
robot could be composed of two 6-DOF SMs connected at
the EEF, in which case the complexity of the IK problem is
more than double that of a 6-DOF SM.
For a fully parallel manipulator, each kinematic chain only
features one actuated joint. Hence, each joint coordinate can
typically be calculated independently of the other joints. De-
riving an analytical solution to the IK for such manipulators
is usually uncomplicated. However, as will be demonstrated
in this paper, Þnding analytical solutions to the IK for fully
parallel manipulators may also be intricate. This is often the
case for lower mobility PMs, as mechanisms of this type
commonly suffer from an unwanted coupled motion of the
EEF. Such motion was named parasitic motion in [2]. Due
to the parasitic motion, the position and orientation of the
EEF is not completely known. Even though the unknown
EEF coordinates are not required to be determined explic-
itly, solving the IK problem for mechanisms with parasitic
motion typically involves calculating both the unknown EEF
coordinates and the coordinates of the actuated joints.
This paper provides a study of the IK problem for a
class of 3-DOF PMs with axis-symmetric arm systems. The
actuated upper arms of the investigated axis-symmetric PMs
have a common axis of rotation, leading to equal manipulator
properties in all radial half planes deÞned by this common
axis. All manipulators in the investigated class suffer from
parasitic motion of the EEF in one DOF, which complicates
the IK problem.

The studied manipulator variants are introduced in Section
II. This class of manipulators includes all variants of the
SCARA-Tau robot [3]. The IK of the original SCARA-Tau
prototype was Þrst presented in [4]. In [5], an alternative
derivation of the IK for this manipulator was proposed and
a solution for a SCARA-Tau variant with triangular link
conÞguration, proposed in [6], was introduced. However,
both [4, 5] only consider the case when the TCP is equal
to the position of a platform joint. Additional variants of
the SCARA-Tau have been proposed in [7]. This paper
presents solutions to the IK problem for general SCARA-
Tau variants with arbitrary choice of TCP. Additionally, the
IK problem is solved for all variants of the Symmetric
SCARA manipulator proposed in [7] and for another similar
mechanism introduced in [8].
A table of abbreviations used throughout the paper is
provided in Table I.
II. 3-DOF AXIS-SYMMETRIC MANIPULATORS
Figure 1 shows six variants of the 3-DOF axis-symmetric
PMs studied in this paper. All the investigated manipulators
comprise a cylindrical base column and an axis-symmetric
arm system. The arm system is composed of three actuated
upper arms with a common axis of rotation, a manipulated
platform, and six 5-DOF or 6-DOF lower arm linkages
(LALs) connecting the upper arms and the manipulated
platform. The LALs are constructed by a Þxed-length link
with a 3-DOF spherical joint on one end and either another
one of these joints or a 2-DOF universal joint on the other
end. All actuators are mounted on the Þxed base column.
As the links in such LALs are only susceptible to axial
forces, they can have a light-weight construction, for example
using carbon Þbre. The axis-symmetric arm system leads to
an extensive positional workspace while the possibility for
inÞnite rotation of the arm system means the manipulators
can always use the shortest path between two programmed
positions.
For the studied class of manipulators, two pairs of LALs
are mounted to form parallelograms in separate planes par-
allel to the common axis of rotation of the upper arms. Such
parallelograms are in the future text referred to as vertical
parallelograms, even if that is only true if the common axis
of rotation of the upper arms is vertical. The two vertical
parallelograms keep two rotational DOFs of the manipulated
platform constant in the entire workspace. The only possible
platform rotation is around an axis parallel to the common
axis of rotation of the upper arms. Ideally, this platform
rotation should remain constant during vertical and radial
motions of the manipulated platform. However, this is not

Fig. 1. 3-DOF axis-symmetric manipulators with different link clustering.
For the manipulator in (a), all upper arm joints in the cluster of three links
are collinear while this is not the case in for the manipulator in (b). For the
manipulators in (e) and (f), the upper arm joints in the cluster of four links
are collinear and the vertical distances between neighbouring joints on the
upper arm are the same as the vertical distances between the corresponding
joints on the manipulated platform.
the case, meaning these manipulators suffer from a parasitic
rotation of the manipulated platform. Parasitic rotation is
further discussed in Section V-A.
The manipulators in Fig. 1(a) and (b) are variants of the
SCARA-Tau manipulator [3]. For the original SCARA-Tau
manipulator, the LALs in the cluster of three are parallel. The
SCARA-Tau variants in Fig. 1(a) and (b) were introduced in
[6] and [7], respectively. They are identical to the original
SCARA-Tau manipulator except for a different position and
orientation of the LAL in the cluster of three that is not part
of the vertical parallelogram. Different arrangements of this
LAL may be used to minimise the parasitic rotation of the
platform or to maximise the manipulator isotropy [7, 8]. The
names Triangular and Quadrilateral are based on the shapes
5737
formed by a projection of the cluster of three links in the x-y
plane. Other variants of the SCARA-Tau manipulator were
proposed in [7, 8].
The manipulators in Fig. 1(c) and (d) are two variants of
the Symmetric SCARA mechanism introduced in [7]. One
advantage of the 2/2/2 clustering compared to the 3/2/1 clus-
tering of the SCARA-Tau is a more equal force distribution
in the LALs. Both the Symmetric SCARA and the SCARA-
Tau may also be designed with a collinear arrangement of
the platform joints of the two vertical parallelograms [7].
The possibility of utilising a 4/1/1 clustering of the LALs
were discussed in [8]. The manipulators in Fig. 1(e) and (f)
are two examples of such manipulators. The 4/1/1 clustering
typically leads to a small angle between the two planes
containing the vertical parallelograms and the stiffness for
such variants must be carefully evaluated. Possibilities to
maximise this stiffness (e.g. by using a wider manipulated
platform) are discussed in [8]. Even though the 4/1/1 con-
Þgurations and the 3/2/1 conÞgurations have very different
manipulator properties, their IK solutions are equivalent.
Hence, the IK solutions for the 4/1/1 mechanisms are not
explicitly discussed in this paper.
For all the illustrated manipulator variants, the linkages
in both parallelograms form equal angles with a horizontal
plane; however, this is not a necessary condition and other
arrangements are also possible [8].

The cylindrical base column B is connected to several
upper arms A
i
via 1-DOF revolving joints R
i
. These joints
are actuated with a common axis of rotation in the centre of
the base column B. The upper arms A
i
are not necessarily
horizontal, which makes it possible to minimise the height of
the base cylinder. The index i is determined by the ordering
of the upper arms, where i= 1 for the upper arm containing
the lowest upper arm joint. If the lowest upper arm joints of
two upper arms are mounted at equal height, the upper arm
with a Ôright-armÕ solution is given the lower value of i.
Each upper arm A
i
is connected via a joint U
i j
to a lower
arm link L
i j
. The index j is used to differ between joints on
the same upper arm. The index is determined by the height of
the upper arm joints and the lowest joint on each upper arm
is assigned j= 1. If two joints on one upper arm are mounted
at the same height, the lowest value of j is assigned to the
joint with the largest perpendicular distance to the common
axis of rotation.
The notation U refers to the location of the joint on the
upper arm and does not describe the type of joint. The
upper arm joints U
i j
are typically spherical joints or joints
kinematically equivalent to spherical joints, allowing rotation
around three concurrent joint axes. However, they could also
be 2-DOF universal joints, in which case the corresponding

joints on the manipulated platform would be 3-DOF spherical
joints.
Each lower arm link L
i j
is connected via a joint P
i j
to a
manipulated platform P. The notation P refers to the location
of the joint on the manipulated platform and not to the
type of joint. These joints are typically 2-DOF universal
joints. However, they could also be spherical joints or joints
kinematically equivalent to spherical joints. In order to
simplify the kinematics, all 2-DOF and 3-DOF joints are
assumed to have concurrent axes of rotation.
The studied mechanisms may utilise joints which provide
inÞnite rotation around the lower arm link axis and +-90

around both the other axes. Examples of such joints are
provided in [9], which also shows how the joint limitations
for such joints may be implemented.

B. Joint Positions on the Upper Arms
The kinematic parameters of the studied manipulators are
indicated in Fig. 2(b). A Þxed coordinate system F is deÞned
with its z-axis being the common rotation axis of the joints
R
i
. The x-axis and y-axis of the coordinate system F are
deÞned to be in the plane perpendicular to the z-axis passing
through the common intersection point of the joint axes of
U
11
. Because the manipulator is axis-symmetric, the x-axis
is deÞned to be an arbitrary direction in this plane while the
y-axis is deÞned according to the right hand rule.
The angles q
i
of the upper arms A
i
are measured from the
x-axis of F according to the right-hand rule. Each upper arm
joint U
i j
is mounted at a perpendicular distance a
i j
from the
z-axis of F with a z-coordinate h
i j
. The value of h
11
is by
deÞnition zero. The position of each joint U

in F as

The position of the TCP in the Þxed coordinate system,

rotation of the three upper arms. The platform joint positions

IV. SUB-PROBLEM OF THE INVERSE KINEMATICS
A sub-problem of the IK problem is determining the
joint angle q
i
of an upper arm A
i
, connected via a lower
arm link L
i j
to a platform joint P
i j
, if the position of the
joint P
i j
in the Þxed coordinate system F is known. This
problem is relatively straightforward and has been presented
previously; however, for completeness it is included here.
For manipulators without parasitic motion, the position and
orientation of the manipulated platform is completely known
and the position of all joints P
i j
are immediately found from
(3), which means this sub-problem comprises the complete
IK problem.
The joint angles can be determined using a geometric
approach or an algebraic approach. The algebraic approach
involves deÞning length equations for the constant distances
between the passive links in a mechanism and thereafter
solving the derived non-linear equation system without
further regard to the geometry of the manipulator. While
this approach often seems more systematic, sometimes the
equations end up unnecessarily complex and the solution
often fails to provide physical insight into a mechanism.
A geometric approach uses understanding of the geometric
structure of a manipulator to derive equations, for example,
noting that certain angles or distances remain constant or
utilising trigonometric functions, such as the law of cosines.
This approach is often less systematic; however, it often
leads to more insight into a mechanism. Both approaches
are demonstrated here. In general, they involve the same
computational complexity and it is not unusual to end up
solving the same equations.
A. Algebraic Approach
If the positions of the platform joints are known, the
joint angles may be determined algebraically from the length
equations of the lower arm links L

tions gives

B. Geometric Approach
The solution in (9) is compact but does not provide
much physical insight into the mechanism. Determining the

different solution and an increased understanding of the
mechanism.

both sides of q

The two solutions separate different working modes of the
mechanism. A conÞguration with only one solution signiÞes
a Type 1 or Type 3 singularity [10].
V. COMPLETE INVERSE KINEMATICS
A. Parasitic Motion
Calculating analytical solutions to the IK for a lower
mobility axis-symmetric PM exhibiting parasitic motion can
be an intricate problem. If the six LALs of the manipulators
in Fig. 1 were connected to arbitrary positions on the
manipulated platform, actuation of the three upper arms
could lead to 6-DOF motion of the platform. For such a
manipulator, the motion in three DOFs can be controlled
whereas the motion in the other three DOFs is a coupled
parasitic motion. In this case, the IK must be determined
when only three of the six coordinates describing the plat-
form position and orientation are explicitly known, which is
an exceedingly difÞcult problem. However, a manipulator
exhibiting parasitic motion in three DOFs would also be
of limited practical use. Axis-symmetric PMs including two
vertical parallelograms, as in Fig. 1, exhibit parasitic motion
in only one DOF. The variation of the yaw angle during
radial and vertical motion of the TCP is considered parasitic
and should ideally remain constant. The yaw angle f may
be expressed as
f(x;y;z)= arctan2(y;x)+f
m
+f
p
(x;y;z); (13)
wheref
m
is the average off(x;y;z) calculated over the plane
where y= 0. Both f
m
and the parasitic yaw angle f
p
(x;y;z)
depend on the manipulator architecture and the choice of
TCP on the manipulated platform. However, the term f
m
can always be eliminated by modifying the deÞnition of the
coordinate system M relative to the manipulated platform. If
the orientation of M is selected depending on the platform
normal, modifying M corresponds to adding a constant
rotation offset to the platform.
A manipulator has the potential to be free of parasitic yaw
rotation if it is possible to select a TCP on the manipulated
platform such that the term f
p
(x;y;z) is zero in the entire
workspace. For the 3-DOF manipulators in Fig. 1 this is not
possible, which means Þnding analytical solutions to the IK
for these mechanisms is a difÞcult problem.
Solving the IK for the 3-DOF PMs in Fig. 1 means
determining three joint angles when only the position of
the EEF (x, y, z) is explicitly known. Two tilt angles of the
platform are implicitly known, as they remain constant in
the entire workspace. Due to the parasitic motion, the yaw
angle (f) is unknown.
Preferably, the IK should be solvable for an arbitrary
mounting of the EEF on the manipulated platform. However,
it is sometimes possible to Þnd an analytical solution for a
particular choice of TCP, even if an analytical solution for
an arbitrary TCP cannot be determined. As will be shown,
for the studied manipulators the solution is simpliÞed if the
TCP is assumed to have the same horizontal position as one
of the joints on the manipulated platform. Even if Þnding
an analytical solution for an arbitrary TCP is preferable,
Þnding an analytical solution for a non-arbitrary TCP may
still be useful for kinematic studies of the manipulator. Also
in this case, the derived expressions completely describe
the motion of the manipulated platform and can be used to
calculate Jacobians, singular values, condition numbers and
for studying the parasitic motion of the manipulator.
B. General Case
For both the algebraic solution (9) and the geometric so-
lution (11), the upper arm angles q
iL
and q
iR
are determined
5740
from the position of one platform joint P
i j
in the Þxed
coordinate system F. This position (p
i jx
, p
i jy
, p
i jz
) is in turn
dependent on f according to (4).
In this section we instead use the notation q
i jR
and q
i jL
for
the upper arm angles determined from one platform joint P
i j
.
Let q
ikR
and q
ikL
be different calculations of the same upper
arm angles based on another platform joint P
ik
connected by
a LAL L
ik
to the same upper arm, where L
ik
must have a
different horizontal projection than L
i j
. As both calculations
of the upper arm angles should give the same result, it
follows that q
i jR
= q
ikR
and q
i jL
= q
ikL
.
For the Symmetric SCARA variants in Fig. 1(c) and (d),
the two links must be L
i j
= L
31
and L
ik
= L
32
. For the
illustrated variants the correct solution is q
3
= q
3L
. Hence, the
yaw angle of the illustrated Symmetric SCARA manipulators
may be determined by solving:
q
31L
(f)  q
32L
(f)= 0: (14)
For the SCARA-Tau variants in Fig. 1(a) and (b), the links
used are selected to be L
i j
= L
11
and L
ik
= L
12
according
to Fig. 2. The correct solution for these variants is q
1
=
q
1R
. Hence, the corresponding equation for the SCARA-Tau
manipulator is
q
11R
(f)  q
12R
(f)= 0: (15)
The only unknown variable in (14) and (15) is the yaw
angle f. These equations have two solutions, where only one
is physically possible due to collisions and joint limitations.
Typically, the studied manipulators are designed to minimize
f
m
and f
p
(x;y;z) in (13), meaning arctan2(y;x) is a good
initial value to numerically Þnd the valid solution. After
determining f from (14) or (15), q
1
, q
2
and q
3
can be
calculated using (9) or (11).
The equations (14) and (15) may be expanded using either
the algebraic IK solution (9) or the geometric IK solution
(11).
C. Non-arbitrary TCP
If the TCP (origin of M) is selected to have the same
horizontal position as a joint P
i j
, then p
i jx
, p
i jy
and p
i jz
in
(8) are equal to x, y, and z+
M
p
i jz
, respectively, in which
case q
i
is immediately determined from (9). Thereafter, a
length equation for a second link L
ik
on the same upper arm
A

can be reformulated as
d

This equation is of the same type as (7) and can be solved the
same way. After f has been calculated, the two remaining
upper arm angles can be determined using (9) or (11).
The presented solution for a non-arbitrary TCP is valid
for all Symmetric SCARA variants if the TCP has the same
horizontal position as P
m1
or P
m2
, where m is the index of the
upper arm not including a vertical parallelogram. Similarly,
the solution is valid for all SCARA-Tau variants if the TCP
has the same horizontal position as P
m1
, P
m2
or P
m3
, where
m is the index of the upper arm including three LALs.
D. Parallel and Triangular Link ConÞgurations
For the Parallel Symmetric SCARA in Fig. 1(c) and the
corresponding SCARA-Tau variant (the original SCARA-
Tau), analytical solutions are possible also for an arbitrary
TCP (origin of M). This is also the case for the Triangular
SCARA-Tau in Fig. 1(a) and the corresponding triangular
conÞguration of a Symmetric SCARA manipulator.
Figure 4 shows projections of the parallel and triangular
SCARA-Tau manipulators in a horizontal plane. Only two
of the upper arms and the LALs connected to these arms
are included. For the SCARA-Tau manipulator, one of the
upper arms must be the one holding the cluster of three
LALs while the other arm must be the one holding the
cluster of two LALs. The notation in Fig. 4 and the solution
presented here are for two SCARA-Tau variants; however,
the solution is equivalent for the corresponding Symmetric
SCARA variants. For the corresponding projections of the
Symmetric SCARA manipulator, one upper arm must be the
one not including a vertical parallelogram and the other upper
arm must have a different arm solution (q
iL
or q
iR
) when
compared to this arm.
The length l
11proj
in Fig. 4(a) is the length of L
11
Õs
projection in the xy-plane given by (10). The required heights
p
i jz
of the platform joint positions in the Þxed coordinate
system F are immediately determined from the z-coordinate
(p
i jz
= z+
M
p
i jz
). The angle f
0
is constant and known.
The IK is calculated by applying PythagorasÕ theorem in
the two right-angled triangles C

C

and FC

Fig. 4(a). The distances c

(b) Triangular SCARA-Tau
Fig. 4. Horizontal projections of two variants of the SCARA-Tau
manipulator. Only two of the three kinematic chains have been included.
Afterf has been calculated, it is straightforward to determine
the two remaining upper arm angles using (9) or (11).
The IK problem for the Triangular SCARA-Tau in
Fig. 1(a) and the corresponding Triangular Symmetric
SCARA manipulator can also be solved analytically for an
arbitrary choice of TCP. Fig. 4(b) show a projection of
the Triangular SCARA-Tau in the xy-plane. Only two of
the upper arms and the LALs connected to these arms are
included. The distance c
b
is constant and known while the
distance c
aproj
is the projection of a constant and known
length in the xy-plane. The angle f
0
is constant and known.
The position of U
11
can be determined from the intersection
of one circle with centre point in the origin of M and radius
c
aproj
+c
b
and another circle with centre point in the origin of
the coordinate system F and radius a
11
(equivalent to solving
the length equations for the constant distances a
11
and
c

+ c

). This leads to two solution
F
u
11
. For the valid
solution, the z-element in the vector product
F
u

([x;y;0]

is positive.
The length equations for the known distances l

and

11
, while
the length equations for l
12proj
andj
M
p

determine the position of P
12
. The yaw angle f can then
be calculated according to f = arctan2(p

  p

; p

while the position of P

can be determined
using (3). These calculations lead to multiple solutions;

After f has been calculated, it is straightforward to deter-

VI. VERIFICATION
Figure 5 provides a veriÞcation of the derived equations.
The IK is calculated for three of the manipulators in Fig. 1
during a radial motion of the TCP (origin of M). For all
three manipulators, the TCP is selected to be in the centre
of the manipulated platform between the four platform joints
of the parallelograms. For all evaluated positions, the values
of y and z are zero while the value of x has been varied.
The minimum value of x is limited by collision between the
lower arm links and the base column. The collisions have
here been identiÞed by visual inspection in the MATLAB
models in Fig. 1; however, an automatic collision detection
for manipulators of this type may be implemented according
to the description in [9]. The maximum value of x is limited
by the lengths of the upper arms and lower arm links.
For each of the three studied manipulators, the values of
q
1
, q
2
, q
3
and f have been calculated by one semi-numerical
method and one analytical method. The applied analytical
method differs between the three manipulators whereas the
semi-numerical method used is the same in all three cases.
The semi-numerical method involves determining f by solv-
ing (14) or (15) using MATLABÕs fsolve function and then
calculating q
1
, q
2
and q
3
using (9). The equations (14) and
(15) were expanded by the geometric IK solution (11).
Figure 5(a) shows the results of the IK calculations for
the Parallel Symmetric SCARA manipulator in Fig. 1(c).
The analytical solution is calculated by applying the method
described in relation to Fig. 4(a). The largest difference be-
tween corresponding angles calculated by the semi-numerical
and the analytical methods in any evaluated position is
2 10
 8
degrees.
Figure 5(b) shows the results of the IK calculations for the
Quadrilateral Symmetric SCARA manipulator in Fig. 1(d).
For this manipulator, the selected TCP has the same horizon-
tal position as joint P
31
, which means it is possible to apply
the analytical method described in Section V-C. The largest

difference between corresponding angles calculated by the
semi-numerical and the analytical methods in any evaluated
position is 7 10

degrees.
Figure 5(c) shows the results of the IK calculations for
the Triangular SCARA-Tau manipulator in Fig. 1(a). An an-
alytical solution to the IK problem is calculated by applying
the method described in relation to Fig. 4(b). The largest
difference between corresponding angles calculated by the
semi-numerical and the analytical methods in any evaluated
position is 4 10
 8
degrees.
As can be seen in Fig. 5, the size of the parasitic yaw
angle variation is very different for the three manipulators
with the largest variation for the Parallel Symmetric SCARA
manipulator in Fig. 1(c). While the yaw angle variation may
not be eliminated, the Quadrilateral variants minimises this
variation [8]. The optimal quadrilateral shape depends on
the length ratio between the lower arm links and the upper
arms. If this ratio is large, the optimal quadrilateral shape is
closer to a triangle, while for ratios closer to one, the optimal
quadrilateral shape is closer to a parallelogram.
VII. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
This paper analysed the IK problem for a class of 3-
DOF axis-symmetric PMs. The manipulators in this class
are composed of three actuated upper arms and six 5-DOF
LALs, four of which are mounted to form two vertical
parallelograms. All manipulators in this class exhibit an
unwanted parasitic platform rotation in one DOF, which
means the IK problem for these manipulators is intricate.
It has been demonstrated that, in the general case, the IK
problem can be reduced to solving one univariate equation
numerically whereas analytical solutions have been presented
for several important special cases.
As the IK will typically be used for real-time automatic
control, valuable future work includes a comparison of the
efÞciency between the analytical and semi-numerical algo-
rithms. A fully numerical algorithm should also be included
as a benchmark.
