Abstract—Colonoscopy is an important procedure for the 
diagnosis of various pathologies, in particular cancer of the 
colon and of the rectum. However, colonoscopy is a procedure 
often painful for the patient and complex for the doctor. So in 
the biomedical field, a wireless microrobot in pipe that can move 
smoothly in water or aqueous medium has urgently been 
demanded. In this paper, we developed a new kind of wireless 
microrobot with symmetrical spiral structure, which also had 
symmetrical kinematic characteristics. According to the 
hydromechanical lubrication theory and Newton viscous law, 
we build the motion model of the microrobot, which will provide 
a theoretical basis on designing the optimal structure 
parameters of the microrobot. Through analysis, simulations 
and experiments, this paper had evaluated the effect of spiral 
angle, which could realize forward-backward, 
upward-downward motion and stopping at any position we need 
in the pipe. In addition, we obtained the moving speeds of 
forward-backward and upward-downward motion in the pipe. 
The experimental results indicated that the maximum moving 
speed is 36.5 mm/s at 14 Hz in the horizontal direction and 4.6 
mm/s at 16Hz in the vertical direction with input currents of 
0.7A. Finally, we designed a control panel for this system, which 
can control the microrobot current motion states intuitively and 
easily, and make our system more portable and compact. The 
developed wireless microrobot can move smoothly in water and 
other liquid medium and is very useful in the industrial 
application and microsurgery application. 
Endovascular intervention has become more and more 
popular in recently. It is widely used in biomedical practice, 
diagnosis and surgery. Pipeline micro-robot is an important 
research branch of MEMS (Micro-Electro-Mechanical 
System). It consists of two aspects. One is to walk in the hard 
pipe, which is widely used in many fields of the chemical 
engineering, nuclear power plant and refrigeration. The other 
one is to walk in the flexible pipe, such as the human 
gastrointestinal (GI) tract, the blood vessel, for biomedical 
treatment. With the development of MEMS technology, make 
the micro-robot which is as a tool in very small spaces, and in 
biomedical practice, possible to enter the body and execute

non-invasive or minimally invasive biomedical operations. In 
biomedical and industrial applications, a new type of 
microrobot in a pipe has urgently been needed [1]-[2]. They 
can move smoothly in water or other liquid medium, making it 
suitable for pipe inspection and microsurgery of blood vessels. 
To minimize the suffering of a patient, a capsule endoscope 
has been developed [3]. However, the capsule cannot control 
its moving direction and moving speed itself, due to the waste 
of large quantities of data. So the capsule endoscope needs an 
autonomous moving function. 
 In our previous study, as wireless microrobots controlled 
by a external magnetic field are both safe and reliable, and can 
be carried deep within the tissues of living organisms in the 
body fluids, it is need to propose a new kind of magnetic field 
model to drive the microrobot easily [4]-[6]. 
 Recently, several types of microrobots utilizing the 
magnetic actuators have been developed. Honda developed a 
new kind of wireless swimming robot with a tail fin which can 
swim in one direction [7]. Thereafter Mei Tao developed 
another kind of wireless microrobot with desirable experiment 
results by using a new kind of intelligent magnetic material 
FMP [8]. Nokata developed new magnetic rotational drive by 
use of magnetic particles with specific gravity smaller than a 
liquid [9]. And especially Professor Guo et al developed a 
novel type of wireless swimming robot with a fin-driven that 
can move in horizontal direction and vertical direction 
[10]-[11]. Then they proposed more kinds of microrobots with 
hybrid motions, such as padding motion, propeller-driven, 
spiral motion [12]-[17]. In our study, previous researchers 
have developed several kinds of wireless microrobots as 
shown in Fig. 1.

In the hybrid motions, the kind of spiral motion can not 
only obtain the maximum driving force, but also is the highest 
efficiency in a very small space. So we need develop a kind of 
microrobots with a symmetrical spiral structure immediately. 
II. MODELING AND ANALYSIS OF THE MICROROBOT 
A. The modeling of the microrobot 
According to the right-hand rule, we established the 
coordinate system for the microrobot movement as shown in 
Fig. 2. In the right-hand coordinate system, V is the axial 
velocity, U is the circumferential velocity. For the sake of 
analysis the force effect of the microrobot, we assumed the 
direction of the screw thread is x-axis, the thickness direction 
of the screw thread is y-axis, the direction which is vertical to 
the microrobot body is z-axis, and ? is the spiral angle. U and 
V can be composed of u
x
 (x-component) and w
z
 
(z-component).

Figure 2.   Conceptual structure of the screw thread 
 
In the previous study, based on hydromechanical 
lubrication theory and Newton viscous law, the similar force 
analysis had been discussed [19]. According to our designed 
microrobot in the pipe, the main force will be evaluated as 
shown in the Table ? in the horizontal direction, which 
consists of f

vertical direction, the G and F

 should be considered 
separately.

Main force Explanation

The total shear stress of the screw thread gap region 
and the thread region in x-axis. 
f z 
The total shear stress of the screw thread gap region 
and the thread region in z-axis. 
F axial The axial traction force. 
F circum The circumferential friction force. 
f l-resist The resistance from the liquid. 
f r-friction The rolling friction between the mircrobot and pipe

According to Newton viscous law, we can obtain the f

 as following: 
            (3) 
where n is the number of thread unit, ? is the viscosity 
coefficient of the liquid, A is the contact area, du/dy is the 
velocity gradient. 
           (4) 
Then we can compute the axial traction force, 
circumferential friction force, resistance from liquid as 
following:

where k is the damping coefficient of the liquid, ? is the 
density of the liquid, S is the front of contact area of the 
microrobot, ? is the coefficient of rolling friction, G is the 
weight of the microrobot, V

 is the volume of the microrobot, 
?
g
 is the density of material used to design the microrobot. 
We can obtain m
g
 from an electronic balance, and 
calculate G and F
u
 easily. In order to simplify the equations, 
we assumed ?=a /a+b, ?=h/c, so we can obtain:  
 (11) 
 (12) 
Therefore, the total force of the microrobot in the 
horizontal direction in-pipe is: 
        (13) 
 In the vertical motion, the microrobot is also influenced by 
its gravity and the buoyancy from the liquid, we assumed 
?F=F

-G, so the total force of the microrobot in the vertical 
direction in-pipe is: 
       (14) 
When the traction force is zero, the axial speed is maximal,

B.  The motion analysis of the microrobot in the horizontal 
direction 
We had simulated the performance effect of the spiral 
angle ? to F

, F

, f
l-resist
, f

, F
horizontal
 and V
max
. By 
refer to the structure of microrobot we designed, we assumed 
?=0.5, ?=1, ?=1, U=0.005, V=0.05, n=5, k=1, ?=1, R=0.003. 
Considered of the size of the microrobot, we fixed the range of 
? is 0° to 90°. The simulation results in the horizontal direction 
as shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4. 
From the results, we conclude that when ? is 20° to 70°, 
F
axial
 the traction force of capsule is positive. Since the 
cross-sectional area of microrobot relative to the pipeline is 
very small, the affection of f
l-resist
 is very small. In addition, 
when ? is equal to 45°, the microrobot can obtain the 
maximum total force and moving speed in the horizontal 
direction.

C.  The motion analysis of the microrobot in the vertical 
direction 
We had also simulated the performance effect of the spiral 
angle ? in the vertical direction. We assumed ?=0.5, ?=1, ?=1, 
U=0.005, V=0.05, n=5, k=1, ?=1, ?
g
=1.1, R=0.003. 
Considered of the size of the microrobot, we fixed the range of 
? is 0° to 90°. The simulation result is shown in Fig. 5. 
 
Figure5.   The curves of F vertical when ? changes 
From (14) and simulation result, we can find that F
vertical
 is 
just related to F
horizontal
 and ?F, and when ? is from10° to 80°, 
the F
vertical
 is a positive value, but it is a very small. So the 
microrobot can achieve upward motion without gravity 
compensation in theory. When ? is 45°, the microrobot can 
obtain the maximum total force 3mN in the vertical direction. 
III. EXPERIMENTS ON THE PROPOSED MICROROBOT 
A. Experiment on forward-backward motion 
In the detection process, the microrobot should complete 
forward-backward motion in the pipe. Base on the theoretical 
analysis of the proposed microrobot [18], so we developed this 
new kind of spiral type microrobot, it as shown in Fig. 6 and 
the design parameters of it is shown in Table ?.

By using the measurement system as shown in Fig. 7, with 
the aided of the laser displacement sensor system, the 
following characteristics of the moving speed were measured. 
We carried out the experiments by changing the frequency of 
input currents from 0Hz to 18Hz, and the amplitude of input 
currents were fixed at 0.7A.

Based on the measurement system, the microrobot can 
achieve rotation motion in the pipe forward-backward. 
Through changing the frequency and phase of input currents 
[18], the experimental results of average moving speed of the 
microrobot were obtained as shown in Fig. 8. 
Due to the completely symmetrical mechanical structure, 
we can find this kind of microrobots has the same kinematic 
characteristics in the horizontal direction. We have also 
obtained the maximum moving speed in the pipe is 36.5mm/s 
around 14Hz. 
B. Experiment on upward-downward motion 
According to our preceding analysis and the simulation 
results in Fig. 5, we can conclude that when ? is from10° to 
80°, the F
vertical
 is a positive value, but it is very small. When ? 
is equal to 45°, the microrobot can obtain the maximum total 
force 3mN in the vertical direction. Through the experiment 
on upward motion, it indicted that the microrobot can difficult 
realize the upward motion in the pipe with a very low speed. In 
addition, considered of simplify the control strategy, we 
should make the kinematic characteristics of the microrobot as 
symmetrical as possible, so we need counterweight for the 
microrobot in order to make ?F=0, which is let the microrobot 
suspend in water. 
Considered the material of the microrobot, we select 
another material that has a small density as gravity 
compensation. The specifications of materials are shown in 
Table ? and Fig. 9.

Figure 9.   The gravity compensation of the microrobot 
 
In addition, the EPE is a kind of very soft material, which 
installs at the head and end of the microrobot will buff the 
microrobot impact the pipeline, so that will improve the safety 
of detection process. The prototype of the microrobot with 
gravity compensation is shown in Fig. 10. 
 
Figure 10.   Prototype of the microrobot with gravity compensation 
 
Based on the measurement system as shown in Fig. 11, the 
microrobot can achieve upward-downward motion in the pipe. 
Through changing the frequency and phase of input currents, 
the experimental results of average moving speed of the 
microrobot were obtained as shown in Fig. 12. We have also 
obtained the maximum moving speed in the pipe is 4.6mm/s 
around 16Hz.   
 
Figure 11.   Measurement system on vertical experiment 
 
Figure 12.   Moving speed of upward-downward motion 
 
Seen from Fig. 8 and Fig. 12, it is finding that this kind of 
microrobots with symmetrical structure has the similar 
kinematic characteristics on the forward-backward and 
upward-downward motion. These symmetrical characteristics 
will make the control strategy much easier. 
C. Experiments on developed microrobots with different 
spiral angles 
We have evaluated the performance of the conceptual 
structure. In this paper, we defined the spiral angle is the angle 
between screw threads and shaft. We also had developed four 
types of microrobots with different spiral angles that 30°, 45°, 
60° and 90°, which had the same length and thread unit 
numbers of spiral structure. The prototypes of the microrobot 
are shown in Fig. 13, and the specification of the spiral 
structures are shown in Table ?.

Base on the experimental measurement system, we also 
measured the moving speeds of different spiral angles of the 
microrobots in the horizontal direction. By changing the 
frequency of the input currents from 0 Hz to 18 Hz, and the 
amplitude of input currents were fixed at 0.7A, the 
experimental results of average speeds were obtained as 
shown in Fig. 14. 
 
Figure 14.   Moving speeds of the microrobots with different spiral angles 
 
From Fig. 14, we can conclude that when the spiral angle 
is 90°, and the moving speed of the microrobot is nearly zero, 
because of there is no driving force in the motion direction. So 
the microrobot just does rotation motion in the pipe, without 
position changing. We can also find the kinematic 
characteristic of the spiral angle 30°, 45° and 60° are very 
similar, but just different from the maximum speed and 
moving frequency width. Due to the differences of mechanical 
structure of the spiral angles, the friction between microrobot 
and pipe is different, and the driving force from the spiral 
structure is also different. 
When in a low frequency, the driving force cannot 
overcome its own gravity to drive the microrobots rotating in 
the pipe. So from 0Hz to 3Hz, the moving speed of the 
microrobots with spiral angle 30°, 45° and 60° is nearly zero. 
But when the frequency of the input currents over 4Hz, the 
microrobots begin to rotate with the rotation magnetic field in 
the pipe. Base on the spiral drive theory and previous analysis 
[19], the microrobots can be moving forward or backward in 
the pipe by changing the order of input currents. In addition, 
when the frequency of the input currents over 16Hz, the 
moving speed of the microrobots in pipe is down to zero. This 
is because the limitation of magnetic field intensity, the 
wireless microrobots can’t rotate following the rotation 
magnetic field at a high level frequency any more, so the 
microrobots will out-of-step with the rotation magnetic field.

We also fitted the speed curves of the kind of microrobots 
with 45° spiral angles, and the moving speed equations (16) 
and (17) for microrobot in the horizontal and vertical direction 
can be obtained from the fitting curves as shown in Fig. 
15.where f is the frequency of input currents, v is the moving 
speed of the microrobot in pipe.

IV. DESIGN OF CONTROL PANEL FOR THE SYSTEM 
At the experimental stage, we usually use a function 
generator to generate sine wave signals, but this way is not 
portable and compact. Based on the experimental results, we 
design a control panel for our system.  
The control panel we designed is shown in Fig. 16. 
Through selection of the buttons, we input the status we 
needed, and then the MCU will output the corresponding 
signals to the amplifying unit and display the current status. 
The control panel can realize stopping, running and changing 
the direction of motion, which can be selected through the 
button control as shown in Fig. 17. In the running status, we 
can choose low-speed motion, mid-speed motion and 
high-speed motion, and the moving speed can be referenced 
by the experimental results.

experimental results, and defined low-speed, mid-speed, 
high-speed motion as the following Table ?.

With this control panel, our system will be portable and 
compact, and we can control the microrobot current motion 
states intuitively and easily. 
V. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
In this paper, a new kind of wireless microrobots in pipe 
with symmetrical spiral structure has been developed. This 
paper has discussed the modeling and analysis the wireless 
microrobot structure. In order to evaluate the performance of 
the spiral structure, we also developed microrobots with 
different spiral angles. The experimental results indicated that 
the microrobot could achieve forward-backward, 
upward-downward motion in the pipe, and could stop at any 
position we needed. The maximum moving speed is 36.5 
mm/s at the frequency of 14 Hz in the horizontal direction and 
4.6 mm/s at the frequency of 16Hz in the vertical direction 
with currents of 0.7A based on the type of Mircorobot 3, 
which is the optimal structure with gravity compensation. 
This kind of microrobots has the similar kinematic 
characteristics in the pipe, so the control strategies become 
much simpler. In order to realize portable and compact control, 
we designed a control panel, which can achieve stopping, 
running and changing the direction of motion. And in the 
running status, we can choose low-speed motion, mid-speed 
motion and high-speed motion. 
In the future, we will focus on reducing the volume of the 
microrobot, and make it suitable for a more small space to 
work. It is also need to establish a more DOFs experimental 
system to realize the microrobot more DOFs motion in the 
pipe.
