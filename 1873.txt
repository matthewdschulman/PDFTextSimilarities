  
Abstract— This paper presents computational and 
experimental analyses on flight dynamics of Flapping Micro Air 
Vehicles (FWMAV) employing a novel flapping mechanism, 
denoted as AIFM (Asymmetric In-phase Flapping Mechanism). 
This mechanism was designed to achieve controlled, asymmetric 
in-phase wing flapping inspired by nature’s flyers. This paper 
extends our previous study where modeling and optimization of 
such a mechanism was carried out. The dynamic effects of 
asymmetric in-phase flapping motion during forward flight are 
our main focus in this study. Kinematics and rigid body 
dynamics modeling are first carried out to derive the equations 
of motion of the system, followed by aerodynamic modeling of 
wing using blade element theory and quasi-unsteady analysis 
techniques. The analysis deals with three configurations of the 
system: symmetric in-phase flapping motion ( 
 
) versus 
asymmetric in-phase flapping motion ( 
  
  
  
). Scaled model 
of AIFM was fabricated and implemented into a FWMAV to 
show its practical feasibility. Some of the key dynamic effects of 
AIFM are addressed, suggesting AIFM solely can generate 
aerodynamic forces and moments which have the potential to 
bring higher agility and controllability to existing FWMAV 
platforms.

I. INTRODUCTION 
We have witnessed remarkable advancements in Flapping 
Wing Micro Air Vehicle (FWMAV) technology in terms of 
downsizing to insect scale and realizing more complex wing 
motion capabilities. However, there still remain unexplored 
areas such as differentially varying the patterns of two 
flapping wings or actively altering the center of mass location. 
Therefore, the level of agility and maneuverability of current 
FWMAV technology, not to mention the flight efficiency, is 
still behind what we observe in nature. For typical 
Penaud-type FWMAV utilize a single or double crank and 
symmetrically placed double rockers (Fig. 1) to flap two 
wings symmetrically in order to attain equivalent lift and 
thrust generation from both wings, while flight controls are 
generally achieved through rudder and elevator control 
commonly placed on the tail.

FWMAV to generate a flapping motion. Symmetric motion is desired 
between two rockers as it directly affects to the stability of FWMAV 
The inner portions of the wings are inclined at a positive 
angle of attack and generate lift similar to airplane wings 
while the tip portions of the wings act as a propeller and 
generate thrust as illustrated in Fig. 2. In this way, the flight 
can be stabilized and easily controlled by means of 
aircraft-like tail. In this regard, the FWMAV is not able to 
successfully perform high maneuvers as seen in nature’s flyers 
since it still banks, turns and climbs in a manner very similar to 
fixed wing aircrafts. The flight stability of this type of 
FWMAV, therefore, highly depends upon symmetric motion 
of the two wings. Slight difference in flapping amplitude or 
phase between the two wings often results in inherent rolling 
or yawing behavior which requires biasing the tail control 
surface to attain a stable flight.

The motivation of this research comes from the observed 
instability in FWMAV induced by asymmetry between two 
wings. Our goal is to identify the dynamic effects of such 
asymmetric flapping on forward flight. Furthermore, present 
work is based on using Asymmetric In-phase Flapping 
Mechanism (AIFM) developed in our previous study [1].  
Before getting into detail on this mechanism, reviewing the 
following phenomena in insect’s flight will be helpful to 
rationalize the purpose of this study. The high speed video 
capturing tethered flight of Coleoptera (beetle) shows the 
asymmetric in-phase flapping feature exhibited in insects (Fig. 
3). It is observed that beetle flies in a circle while tethered, two 
wings flap with different amplitudes but in-phase, i.e., the 
instances of completing upstroke and downstroke of two 
wings are the same but only the amplitude varies. It was 
reported that this actuation uses direct muscles in thorax to 
modulate asymmetric lift generation from each wing thereby 
generating a yaw motion [4].   
 
 
Figure 3.  Tethered flight of a Coleoptera showing asymmetric in-phase 
wing flapping  
There are a number of studies which have investigated the 
aspect of asymmetric flapping motion in body torque 
generation and how it can help achieve high maneuverability 
and stability during flight. To turn, insects asymmetrically 
modulate the wing amplitude of each wing to generate 
asymmetric rowing motions [2]. Only a slight actuation that 
biases their wing motion can generate high maneuvers [3]. It 
was also reported that the asymmetric aerodynamic forces can 
provide a torque to counteract the body rotation [5, 6]. Few 
studies address such asymmetry in wing stroke amplitudes in 
FWMAV [7, 8]. The motion was typically generated by 
piezoelectric actuators and flexible composites where in-phase 
feature may not be precisely controlled. Also, a piezoelectric 
actuator based FWMAV generally needs to be tethered for 
power transmission which brings some limitations for field 
application.  
This paper begins with describing an AIFM model which 
can asymmetrically modulate two wing’s flapping amplitudes 
while guaranteeing in-phase flapping motion. Next, the 
formulation of kinematic and dynamic equations, followed by 
aerodynamic modeling of a wing is presented. The dynamic 
effects of AIFM on forward flapping flight are investigated 
through computational simulation and simulated results are 
partially verified experimentally using a physical construction 
of the mechanism.  
 
II. KINEMATICS AND RIGID BODY DYNAMICS 
A. Mechanism detail 
The AIFM consists of two planar four bar mechanisms 
comprising a gearbox, and two Revolute-Revolute-Prismatic 
-Revolute (RRPR) mechanisms, all of which are driven by a 
single crank OA. The idea is to add additional shell to the 
aforementioned gearbox and modulate gearbox’s lateral 
position inside a shell to achieve different wing outputs. The 
motor drives crank OA, which drives two couplers (ABL and 
ABR). Each coupler is then connected to a rocker, BRDR and 
BLDL, respectively.  Rockers are pivoted at points CR and CL 
inside the gearbox, shown as a box in Fig. 4. Then the gearbox 
can slide laterally through the line EREL. Two RRPR 
mechanisms (CRDRER and CLDLEL), each connects the rocker 
output (BC) to wing output (EF) by having R joint at CR(CL), 
RP joints at DR(DL) and another R joint at ER(EL). ER and EL 
are fixed points on the external frame, depicted as “shell”. 
When gearbox shifts laterally, the distance between the 
gearbox and the shell (i.e., CRER and CLEL) changes which 
brings about asymmetry in wing output. In this process, only 
the amplitude of two wings’ output can be varied without 
affecting the in-phase feature of the two wings.  
 
Figure 4.  schematic drawing of the mechanism: i) double four bar 
mechanism (gearbox) generates symmetric, in-phase output to rockers ii) 
RRPR mechanism translates gear box output to wings iii)  lateral shifting 
mechanism translates gearbox laterally inside the outer shell to create 
asymmetry between two wing outputs 
It is a single degree-of-freedom mechanism if we consider 
the lateral shifting mechanism as a constant input parameter. 
The salient feature of this mechanism is that adding one more 
degree-of-freedom to the common double-four bar flapping 
mechanism, one can achieve asymmetric in-phase flapping 
motion of wings. The kinematics of the wings was evaluated 
through simulation and the simulation results were verified 
experimentally. Both the simulation and experiment results 
showed that the in-phase feature was maintained for both the 
symmetric and asymmetric cases (see [1] for details). 
B. Kinematics  
The joint kinematics can be derived from graphical 
approach using vector loop closure of sub-mechanisms. Since 
it was considered as one degree-of-freedom mechanism with 
single crank input angle  
 
, rest of joint angles (i.e.,  
 
   
 
 
shown in Fig 5) can be expressed as a function of  
 
. The 
derivation of kinematics will not be discussed here, but can be 
found in [1].

C. Rigid body dynamics  
Once all the joint angle expressions are derived, the 
equations of motion of a system can be obtained by first 
expressing the kinetic energy ( 
 
) and the potential energy ( 
 
) 
of sub-chains; crank-coupler chain ( 
 
     
 
), rocker to ext. 
rocker chain ( 
 
     
 
), wing-arm chain ( 
 
     
 
). The length 
of each component is shown in Table I. Note that the same 
value is used for both right and left components ( 
 
  
 
). The 
mass of each component was determined from the physical 
model which will be shown in section IV.

III. AERODYNAMICS 
In this section, quasi-steady aerodynamic model of a wing 
based on Blade Element Theory (BET) is addressed. Based on 
aerodynamic models presented by DeLaurier [9], Ellington 
[10] and Sane/Dickinson [12], some of unsteady effects were 
also taken into account in the model. In order to minimize the 
unsteady aerodynamic effects in the aerodynamic model, a 
Penaud-type FWMAV with stiff leading edge spar wing, 
flying at a constant pitch angle was considered. Since our 
focus was on the forward flight aerodynamics under Reynolds 
number for small birds (     
 
), parameters such as flight 
speed, flapping frequency, dynamically varying pitch angle 
were selected in such a way that it doesn’t exceed attached 
flow range of flapping flight and promotes negligible 
separated flow. The dynamically scaled model of a wing from 
[13] was also designed during this process, which employs 
EH2.0/10 airfoil with 2 % of camber with 10.07 % thickness. 
The wing was divided into a finite number of strips and 
incorporated into the aerodynamic model, which was adopted 
from [9-12]. Some approximations were directly employed 
from other literatures for convenience:  
  
 from [14],  
 
 from 
[10],    from [15]. Not all the derivations of aerodynamic 
parameters will be presented in this section as it is beyond the 
main scope of this study. Hence, we begin from the point 
where we have obtained the section’s normal (  ) and 
chord-wise (  ) force expressions.  
Once    and    are obtained, section’s lift (  ) and 
thrust (  ) can be computed as follow: 
         
 
       
 
      (20) 
         
 
       
 
      (21) 
where  
 
   
 
  
 
    By integrating above two 
expressions over the semi-span of the wing gives 
instantaneous lift and thrust of a whole wing (right-side only).

  ∫  
 
 
 
  ∫ (      
 
       
 
)
 
 
 
    (23) 
Also, average lift and thrust generation for one full cycle can 
be computed by integrating  
 
  
 
 over one full rotation of 
crank and divide by    . Given frequency, lift and thrust as a 
function of time ( 
 
( )
  
 
( )
) for one full cycle can also be 
computed,

The section’s aerodynamic moment about the flapping axis 
generated from the wing is,

 is an instantaneous aerodynamic moment of the whole 
wing about the flapping axis, and  
 
   
 is an average 
aerodynamic moment during one cycle. The aerodynamic 
moment about the center of crank (

from the right wing is

IV. ANALYSIS 
A. Simulation criterion 
Aerodynamic constants used in the simulation are given in 
Table. II. The orientation of vehicle coordinate frame is 
shown in Fig. 6. Often times we may call x-axis the 
longitudinal axis, y-axis the lateral axis and the z-axis the 
vertical axis. Common terminologies which will be used in 
later sections are; roll moment( 
 
), yaw moment ( 
 
) and 
pitch moment ( 
 
).  The simulation results shown in Fig. 7 
are each wing’s output angle displacement and velocity, lift, 
thrust, roll moment and aerodynamic torque required from the 
motor for one full flapping cycle. Three configurations of a 
system were simulated; gearbox positioned at the center 
(   ), gearbox shifted to the right (    ) and shifted to 
the left (    ). The x-axis used in all plots is a crank input 
( 
 
) in degrees during one full cycle (90° to 450°). Note that 
the crank angle starts from 90° to 450° such that start and end 
of x-axis corresponds to the beginning of down stroke to the 
end of upstroke.  
 
Figure 6.  Vehicle coordinate frame and force/torque representation 
Hereafter, a few notations will be used for convenience;  i) 
symbol    denotes the peak to peak flapping wing amplitude, 
 
 
 for the right wing and  
 
 for the left wing, respectively, ii) 
 
 
,  
  
  
  
 denotes three configurations of a system where   
denotes the lateral shifting distance of the gearbox and the 
subscript number denotes a shifting value in mm. In other 
words,  
 
 denotes when gearbox is at the center at which the 
flapping motion of two wings is exactly symmetric and 
in-phase ( 
 
  
 
).   
  
  and  
  
 denotes when gearbox is 
shifted either to the right ( 
 
  
 
) or to the left ( 
 
  
 
), 
respectively, at which  asymmetric in-phase flapping motion 
of the wings occur.

and velocity (

verify the performance of AIFM. We see changes only in 
amplitudes but have in-phase motion between the wings. 
(d)~(f): the peaks of lift curves are biased due to the change in 
  and also the sum of lift over the cycle becomes higher for 
the wing with lager  . But the total lift, (i.e., sum of lift of 
two wings) was equivalent to that of  
 
 configuration. Hence, 
the net lift was consistent regardless of  . (g)~(i): there is a net 
positive thrust from all configurations. Higher net thrust was 
generated from the wing with larger , as expected. 
Interestingly, the total thrust in  
  
 and  
  
  was higher than 
that of  
 
. (j)~(l): In  
 
, the net aerodynamic moment about 
the longitudinal axis is zero as the moment generated from 
each wing had the same magnitude but in opposite direction. 
In  
  
 and   
  
   cases, the magnitude of moment generated 
from each wing is no longer the same as the lift generation 
from each wing is different, which results in either positive or 
negative net roll moment. (m)~(o): the peak of required motor 
torque to generate a flapping motion was higher for larger   
and lower for smaller  . Also, the total motor torque required 
in asymmetric in-phase flapping was higher than that of 
symmetric flapping.

C. Experimental apparatus 
A scaled model of AIFM (7.5 x 7.5 x 4.0 cm) was designed 
and fabricated using carbon fiber materials. The total mass 
was 8.3 grams including micro brushless motor and linear 
actuator. Then FWMAV was fabricated using AIFM, 
implementing electronic components that were remotely 
controlled (Fig 8). The total weight was 15 grams including 
the battery. Experimental test-bed was also designed and 
fabricated for conducting force measurements of three 
configurations (i.e., 
 
,  
  
  
  
)   A 6-axis force-torque 
sensor (NANO17) was mounted directly at the center of mass

location of the vehicle. All six components of force/torque 
generation was measured for last 10 seconds (fs = 2 kHz) 
during 1 minute of actuation, low-pass filtered (Butterworth 
4
th
 order, fl = 10 Hz), and averaged over one full cycle.  The 
force measured from the sensors includes not only the 
aerodynamic forces from the wings but also the inertia forces 
of the mechanism itself. In this sense, additional experiment 
was carried out without the wings attached to the vehicle, then 
subtracted from the force measured with wings attached such 
that the errors from inertia force and mechanical vibration 
from the device can be canceled out in data analysis.

D. Experiment results 
The parameters used in simulation cannot be directly 
applied to the experimental study as the flight speed is zero in 
experimental environment. Hence, data shown in Fig. 9 
should be only discussed for relative changes in forces and 
torques generated by AIFM and may not be used for direct 
comparison with simulation results. Nevertheless, some of 
experimental results still show a good agreement with 
simulation results.  
 
 (thrust) and  
 
 (lift) curves, for example, 
showed similar trend with simulation for   
  
  
 
  
  
. 
Moderate increment in net lift and thrust was also observed 
from  
  
 as compare to  
 
 (Table. III).  
 
 (lateral force) of 
  
 
 showed noticeable variation during one full cycle. It may 
be due to a little asymmetry about the longitudinal axis 
incurred during fabrication and that may have resulted in 
dynamic imbalance of the gearbox, thereby increasing the 
lateral vibration.  In order to identify the relative changes in 
 
 
 between  
  
 and  
 
,   
  
 values were subtracted from that 
of  
 
 to obtain  
     
. It was observed that  
  
 yield either 
positive or negative non-zero lateral force.  
     
  and  
     
 
were computed in a same manner as  
     
 .   
     
 curves 
well matched the simulation results. Moreover, the net  
     
 
was non-zero which again verifies non-zero roll moment 
induced from asymmetric in-phase flapping motion. On the 
other hand,  
     
 clearly showed a noticeable variation 
between  
  
 and   
  
 . Furthermore,  
 
 generated from  
  
  
and  
  
 had the same magnitude but in opposite direction 
which clearly shows yaw moment was generated from 
asymmetric flapping.  
 
 showed slight increase from both of 
 
  
 cases as compare to  
 
.

V. DISCUSSION 
The total lift generation was marginally consistent between 
symmetric and asymmetric flapping motion from both 
simulation and experiment results. This is due to the fact that 
the gain in lift from one side of the wing having larger 
amplitude is compensated by equivalent loss in lift from other 
side of the wing having smaller amplitude.  
The total thrust was increased in asymmetric flapping from 
both simulation and experiment results. Asymmetric flapping 
motion induced a significant variation in thrust generation 
between two wings from simulation which can be directly 
correlated to the net yaw moment observed from the 
experiment.  
The roll moment was zero throughout the full flapping 
cycle in symmetric flapping and net positive or negative roll 
moment generated from asymmetric flapping from simulation 
result. This result was well verified in the experiment which 
showed similar moment curves as well as comparable 
changes in net moment generation.  It is also in accordance 
with other reports [5-8] which showed roll moment attained 
from differentiating lift generation of the two wings. The 
lateral shift of the center of mass due to change in gearbox 
position associated with asymmetric flapping motion 
actuation seemed not to influence the rolling dynamics of the 
system. The mass shifting (±5mm) was less than 7% of body 
width (75mm), and presumably the effect comes from change 
in inertia about the longitudinal axis of the body is negligible

compare to significantly higher aerodynamic forces 
dominating the overall dynamics of the system.   
The total torque required from the motor due to the 
aerodynamic moments of wing was increased in asymmetric 
flapping from simulation. This is due to the increased net 
aerodynamic moment of the wings. Experiment results also 
verified that the device required higher power to reach 3.5 Hz 
to perform an asymmetric flapping,  
The lateral force ( 
 
) was not being considered in the 
aerodynamic model as we assumed the spanwise flow is 
negligible by having higher wing aspect ratio undergoing 
attached steady flow. In general, lateral force is not 
emphasized in most of forward flight dynamic studies due to 
the same reason. Moreover, it can be assumed that net lateral 
force is zero if two wings have aerodynamic symmetry about 
the longitudinal axis, exerting equal but opposite lateral force 
about the longitudinal axis. However, as evidenced in our 
experiment, asymmetric in-phase flapping motion generated 
non-zero lateral force under no airflow condition. This 
finding may explain how some hovering insects can fly 
sideways. However, it should be interpreted with caution. The 
presence of net lateral force from asymmetric in-phase 
flapping may only be valid for very low speed inclined flight 
or hovering flight where airflow is more normal to the airfoil 
such that the spanwise flow can be present. As there is no 
theoretical explanation to validate our hypothesis any further, 
conclusive remark on lateral force generation will not be 
drawn here and will remain for the future studies. 
  
Overall results on the dynamic effects induced from 
asymmetrically modulating flapping amplitude while keeping 
in-phase feature seems to be in good agreement with findings 
from the literatures [9-12]. However, there are some 
limitations in this study as well as some from the mechanism 
perspective that needs to be pointed out.  
First and foremost, the important aspect of wing rotation in 
flapping flight has not been accounted for in this study. 
Although it was our intention to minimize the unsteady 
effects by disregarding the wing rotation in the aerodynamic 
model, it should be included in our follow up study to identify 
the combined dynamic effects of AIFM associated with wing 
rotation. Secondly, since present study only addresses the 
dynamics in forward flight condition with fixed angle of 
attack, inclined and hovering flight cases should be also 
explored. Thirdly, in order to fully characterize the attributes 
of this mechanism under various flight regimes, the system 
should be further analyzed in range of Reynolds number by 
using various       values and/or changing wing design 
parameters. Also, studies on 6 degree-of-freedom flight with 
asymmetric in-phase flapping should be followed as current 
results are only applicable to the body inertially fixed with 
respect to the ground. The argument on the net positive lateral 
force generation from AIFM must be carefully studied by 
looking at the spanwise flow during inclined or hovering 
flight, while also considering effects that come from vortices, 
wake and separated flow.  
From the mechanism point of view, shifting the center of 
mass is coupled with asymmetric flapping motion. This has to 
be accounted for when we study 6 degree-of-freedom flight. 
Moreover, the maximum flapping amplitude of current design 
is less than 60 degrees where insects usually exhibit much 
higher flapping amplitude(    ). Therefore, next version 
of AIFM has to be designed that incorporates larger flapping 
amplitude and decouples the mass shifting to asymmetric 
flapping motion generation.  
VI. CONCLUSION 
This study was motivated from asymmetric flapping 
technique, often can be seen from nature’s flyers, to generate a 
body torque required for maneuver and stabilization. The 
dynamic effects of asymmetric in-phase flapping motion in 
forward flapping flight was investigated by theoretical 
modeling of a mechanism, aerodynamic modeling of wings, 
fabrication of AIFM and FWMAV and analysis through 
simulation and experiment. Both simulation and experiment 
results showed comparable results in dynamic effects induced 
by AIFM.  This mechanism was implemented into smaller 
scale FWMAV which showed its practical feasibility and 
potential to enhance current FWMAV performance. This 
study is also anticipated to help in better understanding of 
asymmetric in-phase flapping motion in flight dynamic 
controls and further provides a physical tool to integrate other 
wing motion attributes, such as asymmetric wing rotation and 
asymmetric stroke plane control.
