Abstract— This paper presents two visual servoing ap-
proaches for nanopositioning in a scanning electron microscope
(SEM). The ﬁrst approach uses the total pixel intensities of an
image as visual measurements for designing the control law.
The positioning error and the platform control are directly
linked with the intensity variations. The second approach is
a frequency domain method that uses Fourier transform to
compute the relative motion between images. In this case,
the control law is designed to minimize the error i.e. the 2D
motion between current and desired images by controlling the
positioning platform movement. Both methods are validated
at different experimental conditions for a task of positioning
silicon microparts using a piezo-positioning platform. The
obtained results demonstrate the efﬁciency and robustness of
the developed methods.
I. INTRODUCTION
Over the past couple of decades, nanomanipulation
has gained signiﬁcant attention due to the advances in
nanoscience and nanotechnology. It is widely used in
many industrial and scientiﬁc works for handling micro-
nanostructures in order to perform dynamic analysis and
characterization of their structural, mechanical, electrical
or optical properties. Moreover, manipulation of nano-
metric objects also beneﬁt in building complex nano-
electromechanical systems (NEMS) [1]. The consequence of
this strong demand is the emergence of an active research
area concerning the development of assembly and handling
technologies on a micro-nanoscale. So far, great progress has
already been realized in the development of microassembly
stations [2], microgrippers [3], precise manipulation systems
as well as robust control strategies. In order to perform
nanomanipulation, the basic tasks include identiﬁcation, po-
sitioning and handling of the objects. Out of all, positioning
is more challenging at this particular scale mainly due to the
lack of accurate feedback information. This problem can be
resolved by considering microscopic imaging systems such
as SEM [4], transmission electron microscope (TEM) or
atomic force microscope (AFM) as the underlying sensors to
control the behavior of robotic devices during the process.
With its ability of producing images with high resolution at
high magniﬁcation in real-time, a SEM is always favoured
This work is conducted with a ﬁnancial support from the project
NANOROBUST (ANR- 11-NANO-006) funded by the Agence Nationale
de la Recherche (ANR), France. It is also performed in the framework of
the Labex ACTION (ANR-11-LABEX-01-01) and the Equipex ROBOTEX
(ANR-10-EQPX-44-01) projects.

tions.
In general, the method of controlling the robotic devices
using vision feedback is commonly termed as visual servoing
[5]. The basic visual servoing approaches are classiﬁed in
two types: position-based and image-based. For position-
based visual servoing, 3D pose of the robot is derived
from the images and is used to minimize the error be-
tween observed and reference poses in the cartesian space
[6]. Whereas for image-based visual servoing, the control
strategy is based on minimizing the error between current
and reference features observed in the images [7]. These
features are local geometric contents (i.e. edges, corners,
etc.) of an object or specially used ﬁducial markers and are
extracted from visual tracking. This tracking process plays
an essential role in the design of visual servoing strategies.
However, recent developments have shown that this tracking
process for visual servoing can be completely replaced by
using the global image information like pixel intensities [8]
or image entropy. Also, as the total image information is
used, it increases the robustness in minimizing the error and
simultaneously increases the overall accuracy of the system
because of the redundancy information.
With SEM as an imaging tool, acquiring images to use
them with visual servoing is always a challenging task. This
is mainly due to the addition of huge amount of noise during
image acquisition process at higher scan rates. Moreover,
the pixels are acquired one at a time slowing down the
overall acquisition rate. Apart from this, when the objects are
in motion, the images appeared to be distorted because of
the sequential raster scanning the surface. This phenomenon
mainly raises the difﬁculty in applying any visual tracking
algorithms. In order to tackle this problem, in this paper,
we consider the direct approach of using the global image
information rather than local features for visual servoing.
Using this technique, two methods have been implemented
for positioning the silicon micro-objects by controlling the
motion of the positioning platform. The ﬁrst one uses the
global pixel intensity values and the second one is based on
the global motion estimation between images. The developed
methods are evaluated at different experimental conditions
such as varying scan speed and magniﬁcations.

3 degrees of freedom (x;y;z) open loop piezo positioning
platform (TRITOR 100 from Piezosystem Jena GmbH) and
two computers. The positioning platform is mounted inside
SEM vacuum chamber and is controlled using a 3 channel
piezo controller NV 40/3. The maximum possible motion
on all axes is up to 100 m with a resolution of 0:2 nm.
The primary computer (PC 1: Intel Pentium 4, CPU 2.24
GHz and 512 MB of RAM) is connected to the SEM control
electronics and imaging system. It is solely responsible for
controlling the microscope. The work computer (PC 2: Intel
Core 2 Duo, CPU 3.16 GHz, and 3.25 GB of RAM) is
connected to the primary one using an Ethernet cross-over
cable. The communication between the two computers is
accomplished by implementing a client-server model using
TCP/IP. The server program runs continuously from the pri-
mary computer and is responsible for receiving and digitizing
the data coming from the image acquisition device. Later, the
acquired images are transferred to the client upon request. On
the work computer, the image client receives these images
and transfers them to the control server. The control server
computes the required control and issues a voltage command
to the platform controller via RS-232 (serial port).
B. Platform voltage-displacement model
In general, the displacement provided by the positioning
platform is a result of the voltage supplied to the piezo
actuator. As the control laws, explained in the next section,
can only provide the displacements, it is necessary to com-
pute the relationship between displacement and input voltage.
Apart from that, it is a well-known fact that the piezoelectric
materials exhibit strong nonlinear hysteresis. So, it is also
required to compensate this effect beforehand. In order to
accomplish this, the experiments are performed by increasing
the voltage from initial value ( 19 V ) to maximum value
(110 V ) with a step change of 1 V and then decreasing
back to the initial value. The respective displacements are
measured using a laser interferometer (outside the SEM
chamber). The tests are conducted for each axis (x and y)
separately and the obtained hysteresis curves are shown in
Fig. 2(a) and Fig. 2(b). Note that, even thoughz axis motion
can be controlled up to 100m, it is not used in this work
since this movement is smaller than the depth of ﬁeld at the
used magniﬁcation and cannot be traced. The ascending and

III. VISUAL SERVOING FOR NANOPOSITIONING
Considering the problem of using feature tracking for vi-
sual servoing in a SEM, in this section we develop two visual
servoing methods for nanopositioning. The ﬁrst method is
based on the concept of photometric visual servoing [8]
that uses the total image pixel intensities for minimizing
the positioning error. The platform control is directly linked
with the variation of pixel intensity values in the image.
The second method uses the concept of phase correlation in
the frequency domain to compute relative motion between
two frames. In this case, the control law is designed to
minimize the error i.e. the 2D motion between current and
desired frames by controlling the platform. Both methods are
explained below.
A. Intensity-based visual servoing
The traditional image-based visual servoing approaches
are based on minimizing the errore between current features
s(t) and desired features s

i.e. e =s(t) s

[7]. In order
to design a vision-based control law, an interaction matrixL
that links the time variation of visual features _ s with camera
instantaneous velocities v, (_ s=Lv) is required. Using this,
the ﬁnal control law is then given by (5).
v = L

where,  being a positive value to ensure an exponential
decrease of the error and L

is the pseudoinverse of L.

As mentioned, in this work we use the pixel intensities as
the visual features i.e. s = I. By considering all the pixels
in imagef(x;y) of sizeMN, the visual feature vector is

where,I
(u;v)
is the intensity of a pixel at location (u;v) and
I is a column vector of size MN. Now, the error is e=

. If we consider the problem of error minimization as an
optimization problem, the primary goal will be to minimize
the cost C given by (7).

When C is minimum, the current position corresponds to
the desired position. Fig. 3(a) shows the shape of the cost
function that has been computed ofﬂine. Now, the interaction
matrix L
I
that links the intensity variation with camera
instantaneous velocities can be derived by considering the
optical ﬂow constraint equation (OFCE) as shown in [9]. For
one pixel at (x;y), it can provide a control upto 6 degrees
of freedom and is given by

Upon computing the interaction matrix, the control law
given by (5) can be used. However, a more feasible solution
can be by using a control law derived of the form Levenberg-
Maquardt optimization technique given by (10) that helps in
better convergence [10].

B. Fourier-based visual servoing
This method is based on estimating the motion between the
images in the Fourier domain. The main reason for choosing
Fourier domain is that with SEM imaging, the brightness and
contrast are not constant and it is known that Fourier-based
motion estimation is robust to these variations and noise.
1) Motion estimation between images: The translation is
estimated using the phase correlation method. It is based on
the Fourier shift property which states that the translation in
the spatial domain can be seen as the linear phase differences
in Fourier domain. Suppose, we have an image f

(x;y)
acquired at desired location and f(x;y) is the displaced
version of f

(x;y), then
f(x;y)=f

(x+
x
;y+
y
) (13)
Let,F

(u;v) andF(u;v) be the Fourier transforms of
f

(x;y) and f(x;y), respectively and are computed as

Now, the translation is reﬂected in the exponential part. It
can be estimated by computing the normalized cross-power

where,F(u;v) is the complex conjugate ofF(u;v). It is

Now, (16) can be solved for overall translation (

). The
convenient way that is used in this work is to ﬁnd the inverse
Fourier transform of (16) that results in a Dirac delta function
given by (17).

Finally, the 2D translation is computed by ﬁnding the max-

where, 
x
and

are the estimated translations in x and y
directions, respectively. Similar to the translation, the rotation
can also be estimated by correlating the magnitude spectra.
However, it is not described in this paper since the platform
can be controlled only in x and y directions.
983
2) Control scheme: For positioning the platform, a control
scheme has been designed considering the 2D translation as
the visual features computed from the previous step. If in
case, the rotation is used, the resulting control can allow us
to decouple the control of rotation and translation (in our
case only translation is used). The current visual features
are

(19)
where, s

are the translations in x, y and z
(=0) axes. The ﬁnal objective is to drive the platform to the
desired location i.e. s

. The task function (error)

(20)
In this case, the shape of the task function that has been
computed ofﬂine by considering only 2D translation is shown
in the Fig. 3(b). By comparing the shape of cost functions
given by both methods, it is clear that the Fourier-based
method shows better convergence. This is mainly due to
its robustness to intensity variations. Now, the relationship
between time variation of visual features and the camera
instantaneous velocities is given by (21).

IV. EXPERIMENTAL VALIDATIONS
Positioning has been performed on silicon microparts (see
Fig. 4) of dimensions 10 m 100 m 20 m placed
on the micropositioning stage. The task is to position the
parts automatically in the desired location by controlling the
platform’s 2 degrees of freedom (xy plane). For demonstra-
tion, the desired location has been selected by an operator
using GUI. Once it is selected, the platform moves back to
its initial position ( 19V; 19V ) from where the servoing
starts. Different experimental conditions that include optimal
scan speed, high scan speed and high magniﬁcation are tested
for both methods. For all tests, the SEM secondary electron
images of size 512 512 pixels are used. Here after, we
call intensity-based method as method-1 and Fourier-based
method as method-2 for simplicity.

A. Positioning task using the images acquired with optimal
scan speed
The initial experiments are conducted to perform a po-
sitioning task and to validate the proposed methods with
an optimal scan speed of 720 nanoseconds per pixel. The
magniﬁcation is ﬁxed to 300. For method-1, the user
selected desired voltages are 50V for x-channel and 60V
for y-channel. Fig. 5(a) and Fig. 5(b) show respectively the

Platform displacement and cost variations during this test
are shown in Fig. 6(a) and Fig. 6(b) respectively. Similarly,
for method-2, an initial voltage of 50V has been selected
for both channels and Fig. 7(a) shows the image acquired at
this location. Fig. 7(b) shows initial image in visual servoing
process and Fig. 7(c) to Fig. 7(f) show the subtracted images

can be seen that both the methods succeeded in reaching the
desired position; however, method-2 shows better accuracy.
B. Positioning task using the images acquired with increased
scan speed
Second tests are performed with an increased raster scan-
ning speed where the image noise is more. It has been
performed to check the method’s efﬁciency in reaching the
desired position at noisy conditions. For this test a scan
speed of 360 nanoseconds per pixel (maximum allowed)
has been used. The selected desired voltages for method-
1 are 50 V and 60 V for x and y channels respectively.

the previous test, method-2 shows better performance.
C. Positioning task with high magniﬁcation
Final experiments are conducted to perform the position-
ing task at a high magniﬁcation of 800. Simultaneously,
both methods are also validated with increased scan speed
at the selected magniﬁcation. The selected scan time is 360
nanoseconds per pixel. The desired voltages selected for

The displacement and error variations are shown in Fig. 16.
The obtained results clearly demonstrate that the posi-
tioning task has been successfully accomplished at high
magniﬁcation.
D. Accuracy of positioning
Since the existing system (SEM) does not allow using
any external displacement measuring devices like laser in-
terferometers, in this work, the positioning accuracy has
been measured directly from the images. Eventhough, the
estimated accuracy is not reliable (due to the presence of
noise); it has been computed to demonstrate the efﬁciency of
the methods in performing a nanopositioning task. Besides, it
depends on the magniﬁcation used (from (24)) and increases
with increase in the magniﬁcation. The accuracy is estimated
using the ﬁnal error image by multiplying the number of
error pixels with pixel dimension on the sample. The pixel
dimension P on the sample is computed using (24).

V. CONCLUSION
An automatic nanopositioning task of silicon microstruc-
tures using a SEM has been presented in this work. It has
been accomplished using two approaches of visual servoing.
The ﬁrst method is a photometric approach where all the
gray level intensities of an image are used as visual features.
The error variation and platform movement are directly
linked with the intensity variation. The second method is
based on estimating the 2D motion between images using
image frequency spectral information. Both the methods are
validated at different experimental conditions. Even though
both methods succeeded in accomplishing the overall task,
Fourier-based method shows better behaviour and accuracy.
This is mainly due to its nature of robustness to image
noise and intensity variations (that is high in case of SEM
imaging). The future work will concentrate on using the
developed approaches for positioning a 3 degrees of freedom
micromanipulator containing a microgripper to perform a
complete nanomanipulation task.
