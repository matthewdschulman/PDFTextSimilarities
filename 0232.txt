Abstract—It has been a challenge to design robots that possess 
intrinsic compliance, especially for robots that are required to 
achieve multi-DOF manipulation. Inspired by human limbs, 
robotic manipulators with internal compliance can perform 
high-quality force/torque control and better human-robot 
interaction. This paper presents a robotic wrist whose size, 
range, and torque output are comparable to those of a human 
wrist. To achieve two collocated and perpendicular axes of 
compliant actuation, two linear compliant couplers are proposed. 
Through slider crank and spherical mechanisms, the linear 
elasticity is converted to rotary elasticity to control the pitch and 
yaw torques at the same time. This new compact design realizes 
series elastic actuation in both axes without increasing size and 
complexity. Static and dynamic models of the compliant wrist are 
developed to analyze the motion. Through experiments of a 
prototype, the wrist is shown to achieve accurate and fast 
force/torque control. We expect this novel compliant wrist to 
serve as an alternative for applications involving human-robot 
interaction.

I. INTRODUCTION 
o meet the industrial need of high payload, accuracy, and 
speed, robotic manipulators have been traditionally 
designed to achieve maximum levels of torque output and 
stiffness. This requires stiff structural and transmission 
components. To reduce the overall weight, the manipulators 
often employ small electromagnetic motors with high gear 
reduction. When the manipulator applies a force to the 
environment, the force magnitude would be very sensitive to 
the displacement of the stiff manipulator. Together with the 
large friction force caused by high gear reduction, these two 
problems limit the manipulators from performing force control 
tasks in an accurate and fast manner. Improving the force 
control quality of industrial robots using high-end controllers 
or sensors, although possible, is usually costly. 
Accurate force control and impact protection become more 
important with the increasing need of robots in a 
human-friendly environment. Unlike stiff industrial 
manipulators, human muscular systems are inherently 
compliant and can provide accurate force control. Inspired by 
nature, a compliant coupler can be placed between the gear 
box and output joint to emulate the muscular compliance. An 
actuator with a compliant coupler is also known as a series 
elastic actuator in the literature [1-2]. Multiple series elastic 
actuators can be used to form a compliant manipulator. With 
the compliant coupler, the output force is much less sensitive 
 
This work was supported in part by the National Science Council of 
Taiwan (with Project No. NSC 101-2221-E-006-027).

to the manipulator displacement. When a displacement sensor 
is used to measure the deformation of the compliant coupler, 
the original force control problem is then converted to a 
displacement control problem [1]. Hence accurate force 
control can be achieved more economically. 
In addition to high-quality force control, the use of a 
compliant coupler can also significantly lower the impedance 
of the manipulator so that it is back-drivable and can reduce 
damage of unexpected human-robot collision. When properly 
designed and calibrated, the embedded displacement sensor 
can be used to obtain the output force. This avoids the use of 
external torque/force sensors which are usually more 
expensive. In addition to robotic manipulators, the concept of 
using compliant coupler has been applied to legged machines 
[3] and rehabilitation devices [4-6]. 
Adding a compliant coupler, on the other hand, will 
inevitably introduce oscillation under internal or external 
high-speed excitation. The position and force response speeds 
would be slower when the stiffness of the compliant coupler 
decreases. To mitigate these issues, the stiffness of the 
compliant element should be large enough. However, too large 
stiffness would in return degrade the force control quality and 
back-drivability. To improve the response of compliant 
manipulators at high speeds, a dual actuation approach has 
been proposed [7]. Another approach is to use variable 
stiffness coupler [8] so that the stiffness of the manipulator can 
adapt to different speeds. However, it is still a challenge to 
employ any additional components without making the 
manipulator too bulky.  
From a mechanical perspective, the difficulty of achieving a 
compliant manipulator is that extra space within each joint is 
required to mount the compliant coupler and its associated 
displacement sensor. Hence the joint usually has to be large 
enough. Most existing compliant manipulators were designed 
by using rotary actuators with commercially available 
torsional springs or custom-made rotary compliant couplers 
[9-10]. This limits the applications to single-axis compliant 
joints that have comparable functions and sizes as human 
elbow or knee. Humanoid robots with intrinsic compliance 
have been proposed [11-13]. However, only one compliant 
axis is realized at each joint. As far as we know, manipulators 
having two or more collocated axes of compliant actuation 
have not been realized. In particular, manipulators with 
multiple perpendicularly intersecting axes of compliant 
actuation can realize multi-dimensional force regulation at the 
same location. They resemble complex human joints such as 
wrists or ankles and thus can be used to achieve an inherently 
compliant humanoid robot.  
Aimed at achieving complex compliant actuation, this paper 
proposes a wrist manipulator with two collocated axes of 
compliant actuation. In what follows, we first present the 
design of the compliant wrist in Sec. II. The kinematic and

static models are developed in Sec. III. The design of the 
compliant couplers is presented in Sec. IV. This is followed by 
the dynamic analysis to verify the performance of the wrist. 
Finally, control experiments of a prototype are presented.  
II. DESIGN OF THE COMPLIANT WRIST 
Fig. 1 shows the CAD model of the proposed compliant 
wrist. The wrist is actuated by two identical linear step motors. 
The bottom pitch motor actuates the pitch mechanism and the 
top yaw motor actuates the yaw mechanism. The pitch and 
yaw mechanisms are connected to the 5R spherical mechanism 
to generate two output axes of rotation that perpendicularly 
intersect at the origin of global frame XYZ. The pitch motion 
rotates ?
p
 around the Y and yaw motion rotates ?
y
 around the X 
axis. Without interference, the wrist can provide a pitch range 
?
p
 from ?59.12° to 45.09° and a yaw range ?
y
 from ?45.77° to 
54.78°. These correspond to motor input displacements from 
?1.79 to 1.39 cm. The encoders behind the motors record the 
motor displacements. The wrist has an end rod that can be 
extended to mount an end-effector.  
Figs. 2 and 3 show the pitch and yaw compliant mechanisms 
at their neutral positions. Each one is a slider crank mechanism 
with a compliant coupler. The link dimensions of the pitch and 
yaw mechanisms are similar. The pitch is placed parallel to the 
XZ plane and the yaw is placed parallel to the YZ plane. The 
deformation of each coupler is measured by using a 
potentiometer (BOURNS® 3048L-5-502) with measureable 
stroke up to 12.7 mm. In Fig. 2, a displacement D
p
 from the 
pitch motor creates a pitch angle ?
p
. In Fig. 3, a displacement 
D
y
 from the yaw motor creates an input yaw angle ?
b
. Through 
the 5R spherical mechanism shown in Fig. 4, the input yaw 
angle is transmitted to the output yaw angle ?
y
. Table 1 lists the 
dimensions of the wrist.  The undeformed lengths of the pitch 
and yaw couplers are denoted as r

 and r

the couplers are denoted as k

The overall size of the wrist is 18.5?7.64?5.0 cm

. Each 
motor can provide a force up to 222 N. At the neutral position, 
the pitch and yaw torque can reach up to ±4.44 Nm. The wrist 
was designed to emulate the size, workspace, and torque 
density of a normal human wrist. The proposed compliant 
wrist is different from others in that the rotational compliance 
is achieved by the transmitted linear compliance provided by 
the two compliant couplers. The two couplers make it possible 
to fit in the restricted space in the wrist without increasing its 
size. The compliant couplers can be readily replaced by rigid 
couplers if rigidity becomes the primary concern.

Once the stiffness and elongation of the couplers are known, 
they can be used to obtained the input and output torques. 
IV. DESIGN OF THE COMPLIANT COUPLERS 
4.1 Design 
The compliant wrist in Fig. 1 relies on two compliant 
couplers to obtain the elastic motion at the output. Each 
coupler needs to provide the required stiffness in the limited 
space (6.5 cm long) between the motor and the spherical 
mechanism. To reduce the complexity of using a parallel 
placed guide rail, the coupler must also be able to resist lateral 
deformation during loading operations.   
Commercially available coil springs of the same stiffness 
are too large and cannot meet the space requirements. We 
propose a custom-made planar spring to serve as the compliant 
coupler. Fig. 7(a) shows the CAD model of the coupler. The 
size of the coupler is 51.5?10.5?6 mm
3
. It consists of four 
serially connected cells when viewed in the XZ plane. The 
cells are connected in a way that neighboring cells are flipped 
vertically. Since the planar spring is not symmetric, the flip 
can be used to reduce the parasitic reaction forces in the X 
direction. Following the method in Refs. [14-15], the shape of 
each cell is numerically optimized in order to achieve the 
required stiffness while maintaining minimal stress. Fig. 7(b) 
shows the assembled view of the yaw coupler. To increase the 
deformation ability, we use Titanium (6Al-4V) as the material. 
Titanium has a very high yield stress to elastic modulus ratio. 
Its density is only slightly larger than Aluminum alloy. The 
coupler is fabricated by using wire electrical-discharge 
machining. Pins with diameter of 2 mm are press-fitted into 
the four holes on the two sides so the coupler is rigidly 
connected to the neighboring aluminum connectors and joints.   
The pitch and yaw couplers have the same dimension and 
stiffness. To ensure accurate force sensing, the stiffness is 
designed such that a noticeable displacement of 1.5 mm can be 
measured in the potentiometer when the motor force is 
196.875 N. This equals to a stiffness of 131.25 N/mm. To 
achieve this stiffness, the corresponding in-plane thickness of 
the cells is 0.77 mm. The in-plane thickness can be changed to 
meet other stiffness requirements without changing other 
dimensions of the coupler. 
This planar spring design offers several unique advantages 
to be an ideal compliant coupler: 
(i) The compliant coupler needs to provide stiffness in both 
tensile and compressive directions. Commercially available 
compression springs cannot be directly used in the tensile 
direction because they have no hooks at the two ends. The 
proposed planar spring, on the other hand, has built-in 
connectors at the two ends and hence can be simultaneously 
used for compression and tension. 
(ii) The planar springs can be designed to have a thin 
cross-section. They can fit in the limited space and make the 
wrist more compact. 
(iii) Unlike coil springs that are flexible in all directions, the 
planar spring can be cleverly designed to have relatively large 
bending stiffness so as to avoid buckling.  
(iv) Although a potentiometer is used to measure the spring 
deformation, planar springs can be designed to have flat 
surfaces for attaching strain gauges. Using strain gauges to 
measure deformation can further minimize the size and 
simplify the design. 
The proposed coupler (denoted as Case B) shown in Fig. 7 
was originated from a trial design (denoted as Case A) shown 
in Fig. 8. Case A is also made of multiple cells. Each cell shape 
is the same as that in Case B. Unlike Case B, the cells in Case 
A were arranged such that they are symmetric in the YZ plane. 
The stiffnesses of both cases are the same. Since the rotational 
axes of the two neighboring joints are normal to the YZ plane, 
this facilitates the fabrication of the coupler and its 
neighboring connectors from one piece of material. As for 
Case B, the coupler and the connectors have to be separately 
fabricated and then rigidly joined by using pins.

Although Case B requires more fabrication and assembly, it 
is preferable because of its superior ability to resist buckling. 
A linear static buckling analysis was performed in ANSYS® 
to compare the buckling load of the two cases. A displacement 
load of P = 1.5 mm was given to each coupler. The two ends of 
the coupler are pinned-pinned in order to comply with its 
motion in the slider crank mechanism. The critical buckling 
load P
cr
 was then obtained. Fig. 9 shows the buckling 
deformation in the XZ and YZ planes, where ? is the load 
multiplier such that P
cr
/P = ?. The larger the value of ?, the 
more the coupler can resist buckling. Although Case A has a 
very large ? in the XZ plane, its ? in the YZ plane is very small. 
Hence buckling in the YZ plane will first occur. As for Case B, 
the multipliers are moderate in both planes. Thus the coupler 
in Case B can resist a larger load before buckling.       
4.2 Comparison of Simulation and Experiment Results 
The solid model of the planar spring was imported into 
ANSYS® for further evaluation. Fig. 10 shows the stress 
diagrams of compression and tension. The maximum 
equivalent stress is 461.89 MPa when an extensional 
displacement of 1.5 mm is given. The maximum equivalent 
stress is about half of the yield stress (828 MPa) of the 
material.  
A static experiment was performed to measure the stiffness 
of the coupler shown in Fig. 7(b). In the experiment, a 
closed-loop sinusoidal force command of 1 Hz and 150 N 
amplitude was given. The actual force was recorded by a force 
sensor and the coupler displacement by the potentiometer. Fig. 
11 shows the experimental force-displacement curves of the 
pitch and yaw couplers. Both curves are very linear with 
almost no hysteresis. The stiffnesses are 126.1 and 143.6 
N/mm, respectively. They are slightly different from the 
desired stiffness of 131.25 N/mm, primarily due to the 
machining and material imperfections. 
V. DYNAMICS AND CONTROL 
5.1 Dynamic model 
We consider the case where an end-effector with mass m is 
attached on the end rod with distance r from the center of the 
wrist. Gravity is assumed to act in the negative Y direction. 
The inertia effects of the links and couplers are much smaller 
than the mass of the end-effector and hence are ignored. The 
kinetic energy T and potential energy V of the wrist can be 
derived as

By using Eqs. (9~11), a simulation is performed in 
MATLAB to study the dynamics of the wrist. The simulation 
parameters are listed in Table 2. Specifically, a considerable 
mass of 1 kg is used to represent the end-effector load. The 
controller gains for the pitch motor are tuned such that a 
maximum speed can be generated without overshoot. The 
motor parameters K
m
, R, and L are experimentally determined. 
Fig. 12(a) shows the step response from -40° to 40°. Two cases 
are tested, the first is with the compliant coupler and the 
second is with a rigid couple where k
p
 is infinity. The same 
controller gains are used, except that there are no ?
p
 and h

terms for the case with a rigid coupler. As can be seen, the 
response of using the compliant coupler is almost the same as 
that of using the rigid coupler. By using the control law in Eq. 
(10), the inherent compliance has negligible effect on the pitch 
angle control. The rise time for both cases is 0.254 sec. Fig. 
12(b) shows the pitch coupler deformation with respect to 
time. The maximum deformation is about 0.5 mm. 
Fig. 13 shows the frequency response of the pitch motion 
where a sinusoidal position signal with frequency of 1.49 Hz 
and amplitude of 40° is given for ?
pr
. Same as that in Fig. 
12(a), the response is almost the same as that of using a rigid 
coupler. The responded amplitude is 28.23°, indicating that the 
bandwidth of the pitch motion is about 1.49 Hz. The 
bandwidth is limited by controller gains and voltage 
saturation. The control law and dynamics of the yaw motion 
can be obtained in a similar fashion. The response speed is 
expected to be slower due to the presence of gravity load.   
5.2 Prototype 
Fig. 14 shows a wrist prototype fabricated based on the 
CAD model shown in Fig. 1. The links and pins are made of 
carbon steel to ensure structural rigidity. Including the bottom 
plate, the wrist weighs about 1.38 kg, of which each motor 
weighs 220 g. 
5.3 Force/Torque control experiments 
Eqs. (9~11) can be simplified to simulate the force control 
response of the wrist. As an illustration, we consider a case 
where the end rod is held fixed at ?
p
 = ?
y
 = 0. The pitch 
mechanism is to follow a reference force f

pitch torque is required to follow a reference torque r

In Eq. (12), a 2-N threshold is used for F

 since forces below 2

potentiometer. When |f

p
 in Eq. 
(12) is used to maintain the static equilibrium position when 
the required force value is satisfied. The second and third 
terms are the PD control inputs. Since the unavoidable 
leadscrew clearance would cause oscillation during small 
force control, the proportional gain is tuned to be a function of 
the measured force f
p

The force control law for the yaw mechanism can be derived in 
a similar fashion. 
At ?
p
 = 0, the pitch force control experiment can be carried 
out in an equivalent configuration where the crank is removed 
and the pitch motor is aligned with the pitch coupler. Fig. 15 
shows the experimental setup. Two load cells (Futek LSB 200, 
maximum 445 N) were used to measure the pitch force f
p
. The 
proposed control law was implemented in NI cRIO 9076 with 
a sampling frequency of 50 kHz. Fig. 16 shows the force step 
response. For the 100-N step response in Fig. 16(a), the rise 
time is 0.046 sec. Except for the slight variation at f
p
 = 50 and 
?50 N, the experiment results match well with the simulation. 
For the 300-N step response in Fig. 16(b), the rise time is 0.088 
sec. The actual response is slower than the simulation. This is 
primarily due to the un-modeled friction force in the pitch 
motor. 
Fig. 17 shows the frequency response of the pitch force. The 
same control law is used in the experiment to track a sinusoidal 
force reference with amplitude of 50 N (small force) and 150 
N (large force). The bandwidth of the small-force response in 
Fig. 17(a) is 17 Hz while the bandwidth of the large-force 
response in Fig. 17(b) is 6.5 Hz. Simulation results are 
compared in both subfigures. The simulation is conducted by 
using the same control law in Eq. (12) without considering 
friction. In the large-force response where the frictional effect 
is more obvious, the experimental response can be seen to be 
slower than the simulation. The results of the 150-N force 
response indicate that the wrist can provide a pitch or yaw 
torque of ±3 Nm with bandwidth of 6.5 Hz. 
VI. CONCLUSIONS 
This paper has presented the design, analysis, and 
experiment of a compliant wrist manipulator. The wrist 
includes two linear step motors, two slider crank mechanisms, 
and a spherical mechanism to achieve pitch and yaw motion 
whose displacement and torque are comparable to those of a 
human wrist. To obtain intrinsic compliance and better force 
control quality, two compliant linear couplers were inserted 
between the motors and linkages. The sizes of the couplers and 
their potentiometers have been specifically designed to 
achieve the required stiffness in a limited space that must 
resemble the appearance of a human wrist. Without 
introducing much complexity, the pitch and yaw compliant 
motions can be simultaneously realized. Torque-control 
experiments showed that a torque amplitude of 3 Nm can be 
achieved with a bandwidth of 6.5 Hz. We expect the proposed 
wrist can be applied to the design of humanoid robot arms and 
rehabilitation devices that require high force control quality.
