I. INTRODUCTION
Extensive research has been conducted in the ﬁeld of
multi-robot systems in the last decades. The scientiﬁc mo-
tivation for studying different aspects of robotic networks
stems from the observationof the swarming behavior of ani-
mals, that can performcomplextasks whenthey are working
in groups. In a similar way, a group of mobile robots with
sensing, communication and computational capabilities can
be successfully used for a wide range of applications such
as search and rescue missions [1], environmental coverage
[2] and area mapping [3].
An application of mobile robotic networks that has at-
tracted the research attention is the area coverage problem,
where a given domain of interest has to be sensed by
a group of mobile nodes. Several distributed coordination
schemes have been proposed by researchers in the speciﬁc
ﬁeld. The majority of them assume convex domains of
interest. In [4] the authors proposed a distributed control
law based on Lloyd’s algorithm and the Voronoi diagrams,
for leading a mobile sensor homogeneousnetwork in a local
optimal state that maximizes the total sensing performance
of the network. In [5] a different scheme was presented in
case of range-limited, uniform sensing patterns that locally
maximizes the total area covered by the network. Many
research activities extended these works for networks with
either heterogeneous [6–8] or anisotropic [9–11] sensing
capabilities. Another extension of [4] is presented in [12,
13] where RF communication constraints are imposed on
the sensor network.
Nevertheless, these coordination schemes are inapplicable
in non-convex areas since signal attenuation caused by non-

convexitiesof the environmentis ignored. Therefore,several
coordination techniques have been proposed for coverage of
concaveareas.Theauthorsin[14,15]presentatechniquefor
transforming a class of non-convexregions into convex ones
using a diffeomorphism. Having achieved that, the control
lawpresentedin[4]canbeappliedinthetransformedconvex
regionandvia the reverseprocessthe real nodes’trajectories
in the non-convex area can be obtained. The use of the
geodesic distance instead of the standard Euclidean one has
been proposed in [16] where the authors proposed a control
schemethatdrivesthenodestoageneralizedcentroidoftheir
Voronoi cells minimizing a coverage-based cost function.
Theauthorsin[17]studiedthecasewheretheareaofinterest
is not known a-priori. They used an entropy (or uncertainty)
metric as density function in order to allow the nodes to
cover and explore the environment at the same time.
Another coordination strategy is proposed in [18], based
on Lloyd’s algorithm and on Euclidean Voronoi tessellation,
that leads the nodes to the projected centroid of a virtual
Voronoicell.However,thisresultsinasub-optimalﬁnalstate
since in this way the coverage of the convex hull of the area
is maximized. In [19] the authors propose a solution based
onpotentialﬁelds, whereeachnodereceivesrepulsiveforces
from other robots and obstacles, while in [20] an attractive
force to the centroid of the corresponding Voronoi cell is
added. A distributed control scheme based on geodesic-disc
sensor footprint is presented in [21,22] where the nodes
converge to a local optimum of an area function. Also, a
visibility-basedalgorithmis presentedin [23]while in [24]a
visibility coverage-orientedapproachis proposedfor solving
an art gallery problem.
The main contribution of this paper is a coordination
scheme for area coverage of non-convex environments, as-
suming a mobile robotic network with visibility-based sen-
sors. The optimality of the algorithm and the monotonicity
of the coverage performance through network evolution are
guaranteed. The rest of this article is organized as fol-
lows: In section II the coverage problem is described along
with assumptions concerning the capabilities of each mobile
robot. In section III the proposed coordination scheme is
presented while in IV its efﬁciency is veriﬁed via numerical
simulations. Concluding remarks are presented in the last
section.

CONCAVE REGIONS
Consider a group of n mobile robots (also referred to
as “nodes”) responsible for the coverage of a concave area

where u

is the control input.
Assuming area coverage purposes, each node is equipped
with a device with sensing capabilities. In this article, the
mobile robotic platforms are assumed to be equipped with
omnidirectional camera-sensors. Before providing a formal
deﬁnition of such a pattern, it is essential to deﬁne the
visibility polygon of an arbitrary node.
Deﬁnition 1: The visibility polygon of an arbitrary node
i, denoted as VP
i
, is deﬁned as the set of points q?A that
are visible from i, that is
VP
i
={q?A|[x
i
,q]?A} , (2)
where [x
i
,q] is the closed segment connecting x
i
and q.
Considering the deﬁnition of the visibility polygon along
with the fact that a camera may have a range-limited ﬁeld
of view, one can deﬁne the visibility disc (right part of Fig.
1) as follows.
Deﬁnition 2: The visibility disc of a node i, denoted as
C
i
, is deﬁned as the set of points q?VP
i
being in distance
less or equal to r, that is
C
i
={q?VP
i
?B
i
} , (3)
where B
i
={q?A|kq?x
i
k≤r}.
Assumption 1: Each node is assumed to be equippedwith
an omnidirectional camera-sensor sensing all the points of
the domain of interest lying in its visibility disc as deﬁned
in (3) while sensing range, r is assumed to be ﬁxed and
common for all nodes.

disc [right] corresponding to red node.
In an area coverage problem mobile robots should plan
their motions so that the area sensed is increasing through
time. This performancecan be representedas the summation
of the regions sensed by the nodes and is deﬁned as follows:
H =
n
∑
i=1
Z
W
i
f(x
i
;q)?(q)dq , (4)
where f(x
i
;q)assesses the performanceofthe sensorlocated
at x
i
in point q, ?(q) is a density function describing the
importanceofa pointq?AwhileW
i
isthedominanceregion
assigned to i-th node. The sensing model is assumed to be
described by the following performance function:
f(x
i
,q)=

1 if q?C
i
0 otherwise.
(5)
One of the most important issues in an area coverage
problem is the tessellation of the domain of interest so that
the proposed control law is distributed. One common tool
for partitioning an area of interest is the Voronoi diagrams
that divide the region into subsets, V
i
, i =1,...,n, assigned
amongthe nodesin such a way that each node is responsible
for sensing only the points that are closer to it than to any
other node.
However, an alternative way of partitioning is needed in
the case that the sensing pattern is not a Euclidean disc but a
visibilitydisc,sinceclassical Voronoidiagramsdoesnottake
into account nodes’ visibility. Therefore the visibility-based
Voronoi diagrams [23] will be used.
Deﬁnition 3: Visibility-based Voronoi diagrams generated
by X is the set V =

V
1
vis
,...,V
n
vis
	
, i=1,...,n where V
i
vis
is
called visibility-based Voronoi cell of node i andcontainsthe
points that are visible to node i and closer to it than to any
other node, in case of points visible to other nodes as well:
V
i
vis
={q?VP
i
| kq?x
i
k≤


q?x
j


, ?j6=i, q?VP
j
} (6)
Based on the above deﬁnition, neighboring relationships
can be determined among the nodes. Thus, two nodes are
called visibility-based Delaunay neighbors if they share an
edge (or a part of an edge) of their corresponding visibility-
based Voronoi cells. The set containing visibility-based De-
launay neighbors of an arbitrary node i, denoted as D
i
can
be expressed as:
D
i
=
n
j6=i | V
i
vis
?V
j
vis
6=? (non singleton)
o
. (7)
Considering the fact that sensors may have a range lim-
ited ﬁeld of view, the range-limited visibility-based Voronoi
diagrams can be deﬁned.
Deﬁnition 4: Range-limited visibility-based Voronoi dia-
grams generated by X is the set V
r
=
n
V
1
r,vis

n
r,vis
o
, i=
1,...,n where V
i
r,vis
is called range-limited visibility-based
Voronoi cell of node i and contains the points that belong
to V
i
vis
and C
i
simultaneously, i.e:
V
i
r,vis
={q?V
i
vis
?C
i
}. (8)
Equivalently to the deﬁnition of visibility-based power
Delaunay neighbors, one can deﬁne the range-limited ones.
Twonodesarecalledrange-limitedvisibilitybasedDelaunay
neighborsif the intersection of their respective range-limited
visibility-based Voronoi cells is non-empty. Thus, the set of
the range-limited visibility based Delaunay neighbors of a
node i can be written as:
D
r
i
=
n
j6=i | V
i
r,vis
?V

r,vis

Motivated by this observation, we make the following
assumptioninordertoguaranteethateachnodecancompute
its V

Assumption 2: Each node can communicate with any
other node residing in its communication range deﬁned as:
C

Remark 1: Considering deﬁnition 3, the following prop-
erties for visibility-based Voronoi diagrams are derived:
• Visibility-based Voronoi diagrams cannot provide a full
tessellation of the area of interest, which means that
S
i=1,...n
V
i

? A. This is a direct consequence of the
fact that visibility-based Voronoi diagrams is not a
partitioning of the domain A, but a partitioning of the
total area visible to the nodes.
• Thevisibility-basedVoronoicellassignedtoanarbitrary
node i may be a disconnected or a non–convex set, as
depicted in Fig. 2.

Considering the equations (5) and (8) along with the fact
that the region covered by the network can be expressed as
the union of the correspondingrange-limitedvisibility-based
Voronoidiagrams,the areafunctionto be optimized(11)can
be written as :
H =

are
referred to as Voronoi cell and range-limited Voronoi cell of
node i respectively.
III. DISTRIBUTED CONTROL LAW
Thissectionis mainlyfocusedonthe designofa gradient-
based control scheme so that the mobile sensor network
optimizes the aforementioned performance function. Before
presenting this scheme, let us introduce the notations that
will be used in the proof of the proposed control law.
Initially, let us denote the boundary of any set as ∂(·).
Thus, the set ∂(V
i
r,vis
)?∂(B
i
) is the set that contains the arcs
of B
i
that are visible to node i and at the same time belong
to ∂(V
i
r,vis
). Also the set ∂(VP
i
)
T
∂(V
i
r,vis
) contains multiple
edges (line segments) belonging both to the visibility poly-
gon of node i, ∂(VP
i
), and to ∂(V
i
r,vis
). Speciﬁcally, these
edges, may lie either on the boundary of the environment or
exclusively on ∂(VP
i
)
T
∂(V
i
r,vis
). The set that contains the
latter edges is the (∂VP
i
?∂V
i
r,vis
)\∂A and will be denoted
as P
i
for the sake of simplicity. As depicted in Fig. 3, the
set P
i
consists of non-intersecting line segments. Introducing
the notation [p
1
,p
2
] for a line segment determined by points
p
1
and p
2
, the set (∂VP
i
?∂V
i
r,vis
)\∂A can be written as:
P

is the number of the aforementioned edges, belonging to

Moreover, one can observe that the set ∂VP

\∂A contains
line segments collinear with a reﬂex vertex of ∂A. Let
denote these reﬂex vertices as p

that:kx

to the node-2, the thick red line represents the arcs of

Proof: In order to seek for maximizers of the perfor-
mance function (11) the ﬁrst step is to differentiate it with
respect to x
i
. In this way, we have:

Utilizing the Leibniz integral rule [25], equation (14) can
be simpliﬁed as :

(15)
where n
i
(q) is the normal outward unit vector at q?∂V

.
Regarding the ﬁrst integral, the boundary ∂V

can be
decomposed on parts that lie either on ∂A, ∂V
i
r,vis
?∂V
j
r,vis
,
∂V

, or on P

. It is worth mentioning to note that the
last mentioned set contains edges that belong exclusively on
∂(VP

)
T
∂(V

).
Thus, equation (15) can be written as:

Considering that points q? ∂A are not affected by in-

Consequently, (16) can be simpliﬁed as:

The ﬁrst integral of (17) can be further simpliﬁed consid-
eringthatall pointsq?∂V

case:

where I is the identity matrix.
As for the second integral of (17), the equation that
describes the points q ? P

is needed to be determined.
Withoutlossofgenerality,let q?[p

proving that the proposed control law (13) leads to gradient
ﬂow along nodes’ trajectories, which completes the proof.
The control law (13) is explainedin Fig. 4, where a single
node has been placed is a simple ?-shaped environment.
The control input of the node has been analyzed into two
components. The ﬁrst one (orange) stands for the ﬁrst term
of (13), which is deﬁned over the arcs ∂V

, while
the second one (blue) represents the second term in (13).
The direction of the blue vector denotes the optimal increase
of the node’s visibility polygon VP

. The resulting control
action corresponds to the black vector.
Remark 2: The proposed control law is characterized by
a distributed nature since for the evaluation of visibility-
based Voronoi diagramsand of sets P
i
only the range-limited
visibility-basedDelaunayneighbors’coordinatesare needed.

Remark 3: In case the control law (13) leads a node
in a position outside of the domain of interest, that node
should move along a suboptimal direction determinedby the
projection of the gradient direction to the boundary of the

IV. SIMULATION STUDIES
In this section, simulation studies are presented in order
to verify the results obtained in the previous section. It
shouldbenotedthatthroughoutthesesimulationsthedensity
function has been set to unity for all the points in the
environment, i.e. ?(q)=1, ?q?A.
In the ﬁrst simulation, the considered concave domain is
surveyed by a group of n=15 nodes equipped with sensors
of sensing radius r =0.6 units. The initial network conﬁg-
uration is depicted in the left part Fig. 5 while the nodes’
trajectories through time and the ﬁnal network conﬁguration
are presented in the middle and the right part of the same
ﬁgure, respectively. Nodes are initially deployed in the left
down corner of the domain and in the ﬁnal state nodes
have reached a local maximum of performance function
(11), sensing 86% of the whole area (Fig. 7) which is quite
satisfactory considering the complexity of the environment.
Also the trajectories of the nodes indicate that they tend to
follow in groupsroughly the same path while traversing part
of the environment.
Another simulation study is provided in Fig. 6 where
n=13 robots with sensing range r=0.6 units should sense
a non-convex domain of total area 9.5 units
2
. Nodes are
initially positionedas depictedin the upperleft part ofFig. 6
sensing 14.7% of the whole domain while according to their
sensing capabilities a full area coverage can be achieved.

V. CONCLUSIONS
A distributed visibility-based coordination scheme was
presented for the coverage problem of non-convex domains
that monotonically maximizes the area covered by the net-
work,consideringthatnodesareequippedwithrange-limited
