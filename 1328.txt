Abstract— This paper presents the three dimensional kine-
matic modeling of a novel steerable robotic ablation catheter
system. The catheter, embedded with a set of current-carrying
micro-coils, is actuated by the magnetic forces generated by
the magnetic ﬁeld of the MRI scanner. This paper develops
a 3D model of the MRI actuated steerable catheter system
by using ﬁnite differences approach. For each ﬁnite segment, a
quasi-static torque-deﬂection equilibrium equation is calculated
using beam theory. By using the deﬂection displacements and
torsion angles, the kinematic modeling of the catheter system is
derived. The proposed models are evaluated by comparing the
simulation results of the proposed model with the experimental
results of a proof-of-concept prototype.
I. INTRODUCTION
Catheter ablation is a widely recognized interventional
procedure for treatment of cardiac arrhythmia [1]. During
the procedure, the physician typically inserts a catheter
into the femoral vein, and guides it into the right atrium,
then penetrates it through the atrial septum into the left
atrium, as shown in Fig. 1. The catheter tip reaches the
desired area required by operator, such as, the ostia of the
pulmonary veins (Fig. 1), and applies radiofrequency energy
to build ablation barriers to prevent the spread of the irregular
electrical signals. During the past decade, a robotic-assisted
catheter ablation has increasingly gained many researchers’
interests, due to its premise of stable manipulation of the
catheter, precise navigation and dexterous control of the
catheter tip, and shorter procedure time.
This paper presents the three dimensional kinematic mod-
eling of a steerable robotic ablation catheter system actu-
ated by a novel actuation method which uses the magnetic
ﬁeld of a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner. In
this actuation method, which was originally proposed by
Roberts et al. [2] and also investigated by Gudino et al.
[3], the catheter is embedded with a set of current-carrying
micro-coils. The catheter is actuated by the magnetic forces
generated by the magnetic ﬁeld of the MRI scanner on these
coils, by controlling the amount of current going through
the coils. The kinematic conﬁguration of the catheter and
the deﬂection under loads of force and torque are modeled
using a ﬁnite differences approach. The deformation of each
segment in the ﬁnite differences model is computed using

beam theory under mechanical equilibrium conditions. The
direct kinematic model is built by using these models.
The focus of the modeling presented here is the active
bending of the catheter to perform the ablation once it is
inside the left atrium (Fig. 1). In the ablation procedure, the
catheter is remotely controlled by the physician after it is
manually inserted into the desired position in the left atrium.
Due to the penetration through the atrial septum, which has
substantial frictions at this location, it is reasonable to assume
that the catheter in the left atrium is ﬁxed to the atrial septum.
Our current priority is modeling the catheter’s deﬂection mo-
tions in free space and validating this free-space model with
the proof-of-concept prototype’s experimental results [3], as
this modeling will play a signiﬁcant role in the following
research. As the material of the proof-of-concept catheter is
the manufacturer’s proprietary information, estimating these
mechanical parameters based on the experimental results are
also presented.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Related stud-
ies in the literature regarding magnetically steerable catheter
systems and catheter modeling are discussed in section II.
The modeling of the active catheter is presented in section
III. Estimation of the mechanical properties of the catheter
prototype is presented in section IV. The validation of the
proposed model, including comparisons with experimental
deﬂection results reported in [3], are presented in section V.
The discussion and conclusion are presented in section VI.

There are several types of active catheters proposed in the
literature employing different actuation methods. Magnetic

actuation is one of the active and growing actuation methods
employed. One advantage of magnetic actuation is the ability
to place the actuation on the tip rather than at the distal
end outside patient body, thus increasing the bandwidth by
reducing backlash and friction.
In general, there are two ways of using magnetic actuation
for catheter’s navigation. The ﬁrst method is to place a
permanent magnet on the catheter tip and stay in an external
magnetic ﬁeld. The Niobe
R 
ES magnetic navigation system
(Stereotaxis, St. Louis, MO) utilizes two permanent magnets
mounted on two pivoting arms located on either side of
surgical bed to navigate the catheter [4–6]. The catheter,
which has a permanent magnet mounted on its distal tip,
is placed in the external magnetic ﬁeld which can selec-
tively change directions and magnitudes. The attraction and
repulsion among the magnets are then used to deﬂect the
catheter as desired. Similarly, Lalande et al. [7] showed
that a catheter with some ferromagnetic spheres attached
on its tip can be bent and steered inside a MRI system
by using magnetic gradients. The second approach is to
utilize the physical phenomenon that a current-carrying wire
in an external magnetic ﬁeld is able to produce a magnetic
force. Roberts et al. [2], Settecase et al. [8], and Gudino
et al. [3], separately demonstrate that a catheter with an
array of current-carrying coils mounted on its distal tip can
perform an arbitrary 3-dimensional deﬂection inside clinical
MRI scanners. A review of different remote control catheter
navigation approaches under MRI is presented in [9].
There are a number of earlier studies on modeling of a
catheter under a combined loading. Large deﬂection models
of cantilever beams in a 2-dimensional plane are proposed
in the ﬁeld of mechanics of material [10–12]. Khoshnam
et al. [13] modeled the distal section of a catheter by
using beam theory. However, these traditional beam theories
are not directly extendable to the 3-dimensional catheter
deﬂections as well as torsions. The beam theory can not solve
the problem with large deﬂection angles. Some numerical
approaches have been proposed. For example, Cotin et al.
[14] assumed the catheter is composed of wire-like segments
and developed an incremental ﬁnite element model based
on beam theory. Lawtwon et al. [15] used rotation group
and its algebra to derive the Euler differential equations
that described the equilibrium conﬁgurations of catheters
through potential energy relations. Furthermore, Tunay [6]
from Stereotaxis developed a simpler quasi-3D Lawtwon’s
model.
This paper proposes a new approach combining ﬁnite
differences approach, beam theory and rotation groups to an-
alyze the catheter’s 3D deﬂection motion. First, the catheter
is approximated to be composed of a set of ﬁnite segments.
The deﬂection problem of each small segment is assumed
to have small deﬂection angles, and solved by beam theory
and the Bernoulli-Euler law. Once each segment’s deﬂection
angles and torsion angle are known, the positions of all points
on this segment can be found. Considering the each segment
as a robot link with the two ends of the segment as the link’s
joints, the homogeneous transformation relationship between
the two ends of the segments are calculated. Using these,
the homogeneous transformation relationship between any
two ends from two segments can be found. The equilibrium
conﬁguration about force and torque of each segment are
then set up based on each segment’s deﬂection angles.

IV. ESTIMATION OF CATHETER PROTOTYPE’S
MECHANICAL PARAMETERS
The quantitative comparisons between the simulation re-
sults of the proposed model and the experimental results
of the catheter prototype presented in [3] under the same
experimental environment validate the proposed model of the
catheter system. Fig. 8 shows this proof-of-concept prototype
built by Gudino [3], which is made by a 2.5 Fr (0.83mm)
ﬁber braided microcatheter (Renegade, Boston Scientiﬁc).

An array of current-carrying coils made of 42 gauge wire
is mounted at the tip of the catheter, coil 1 with a 15-
turn square side coil, coil 2 with a 70-turn axial coil and
coil 3 with a 70-turn axial coil. It is immersed in a water
phantom containing 1% Gd-DTPA, which is placed in MRI
scanner. The experimental setup is shown in Fig. 9. The

magnetic ﬁeld with an amplitude of B

= 1.5 T, is pointing
horizontally right and perpendicular to the catheter shape in
zero conﬁguration. The direction of gravity points vertically
down. The experimental result of the total deﬂection of the
catheter is shown with black markers in Fig. 10(a). They
measure 8 quantitative deﬂections with 8 different currents
by exciting coils.
However, the actual material of this microcatheter is
unknown, as it is the proprietary information of the catheter
manufacturer. We need to estimate the mechanical parame-
ters of this catheter material, i.e., its density, young’s modu-
lus, poisson’s ratio and shear’s modulus, prior to the valida-
tion of the proposed models. Additionally, the experimental
data indicates that there is an initial catheter tip deﬂection,
1.5991 cm as shown in Fig. 10(a), when no current input
to the catheter, due to the natural bent of the catheter. In
this study, this rest bending of the catheter is approximately

modeled by an external force acting on the catheter tip, which
also needs to be estimated.
These parameters are estimated from 3 data points, cor-
responding to the rest deﬂection of the catheter (no current
applied), largest deﬂection obtained by exciting all three coils
at 100 mA, and the deﬂection obtained by exciting only
the distant axial coil at 130 mA. The parameters are then
estimated by ﬁnding the set of parameters that minimizes
the error between the actual deﬂection measurements and
the deﬂections estimated by the model.
The computation of this minimization problem provides
us a set of appropriate parameters as: young’s modulus

used to estimate the total deﬂection of the catheter by
sequentially exciting the active coils, as shown in Fig. 10.
The experimental results obtained by exciting only the distal
axial coil at the tip from 0 mA to 130 mA, are marked with
black diamonds in Fig 10(a). Under the same excitation, the
simulation deﬂections computed by the proposed model are
marked with the red circles. The black triangle represents the
largest experimental deﬂection by exciting all active coils,
while the red square represents the corresponding largest
deﬂection in the simulation. Fig. 10(b) shows the percentage
error between the corresponding experimental and simulation
deﬂections. It is conﬁrmed that the percentage errors of the
three characteristic deﬂections are small, as minimizing them
gets the estimation parameters. The largest percentage error
is less than 14%. These comparisons demonstrate that the
model matches with the experimental results.
VI. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
In this paper, a 3D model of a steerable catheter using
an array of active steering coils in a magnetic ﬁeld in free
space is presented. In the proposed method, the catheter
is modeled as a series of ﬁnite segments. The deﬂection
displacement and torsion angle for each segment at the quasi-
static equilibrium condition were calculated using beam
theory. The catheter’s deﬂections estimated by the proposed
model matches with the experimental results collected by
Gudino et al. [3] under the same experimental conditions.
The computation time of the proposed model for com-
puting the tip location is important concerns for clinical
applicability of the methods. The numerical computation of
the direct kinematic model given the current inputs takes
approximately 4 seconds on a computer equipped with
Intel
R 
core i7-960 CPU @ 3.20 GHz and 12.0 GB memory,
running 64-bit Microsoft Windows 7 operating system. The
calculation is implemented in Matlab
R 
7.11.0 (R2010b).
In the future, this proposed catheter model will be used
to optimize the catheter prototype design according to the
clinical ablation application. The design issues include the
selection of the material and the dimension of the catheter,
the type and the number of coils, the number of winding per
each coil, the placement of the coils and so on.
