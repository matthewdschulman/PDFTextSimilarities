Abstract— This paper presents a biomimetic robotic ﬁsh that
swims using thunniform kinematics for advanced underwater
mobility. Propulsion and maneuvering of the robotic ﬁsh are
achieved with a lunate caudal ﬁn that undergoes combined
translational and rotational motion. A parallel four-bar propul-
sive mechanism attached to the rear of the rigid torpedo-
shaped body is used to deliver motor rotation to the caudal
ﬁn. Oscillatory control signals for the tail joints are generated
with a CPG controller composed of two unidirectionally coupled
Hopf oscillators. Coupling terms that allow direct speciﬁcation
of phase relation between oscillators are formulated. The
maximum speed of the robotic ﬁsh can reach 2.0 m/s and
excellent maneuverability has been exhibited. The outstanding
swimming performances present exciting possibilities for real-
world deployment of the robotic ﬁsh.
I. INTRODUCTION
The process of evolution has produced highly effective
biological mechanisms for aquatic locomotion. Fishes, as
the ultimate examples of superior swimmers, have evolved
an astonishing level of swimming capabilities, with some
species able to cruise great distances at signiﬁcant speed,
while other species excel at dynamic stability in turbulent
waters and low-speed maneuvers in tight spaces [1]. Recent
years have witnessed a signiﬁcant progress in the devel-
opment of biomimetic underwater vehicles that propel and
maneuver themselves utilizing ﬁsh-like movements [2]–[9].
The driving motivation for such research efforts is to achieve
enhanced swimming performance in speed, efﬁciency, accel-
eration, agility and stealth over conventional propeller-driven
underwater vehicles.
Despite extensive research efforts over the past two
decades, most robotic ﬁshes have remained merely laboratory
curiosities. Reports on real-world applications of robotic
ﬁshes are very scarce, although it was anticipated that they
would become highly functional platforms applicable for a
wide range of underwater missions. The current situation is
partly due to the increasingly demanding mission require-
ments, but more important is the fact that their swimming
performances are far inferior to traditional unmanned under-
water vehicles (UUV), not to mention their natural coun-
terparts. According to the literature reports, the maximum
speed attained by robotic ﬁsh is 1.36m/s [3], while the
operational speed of UUV range from 0.5 to 5 m/s. Fish-
like swimming has been proved more economical than screw

propulsion in terms of hydrodynamic efﬁciency by a number
of theoretical and experimental studies, but the reciprocating
movements of ﬁns require more complicated drive trains than
the rotational motion of propellers, leading to lower overall
efﬁciency. Further, the ﬂexible body of robotic ﬁsh makes
it difﬁcult to install payload and to resist water pressure
in deep diving. An obvious advantage that robotic ﬁshes
have exhibited lies in maneuverability, thanks to the use of
multiple ﬁns and ﬂexible bodies. Fishes have undoubtedly
provided an ideal solution to underwater locomotion, but
their engineered replicas are still at an early stage of de-
velopment. Knowledge from diverse disciplines, such as ﬁsh
physiology, bio-hydrodynamics, artiﬁcial muscle technology
and neuroscience-based control, should be integrated in order
to bridge the gap between nature and engineering [10].
Today’s UUV missions require a variety of capabili-
ties: high speed, excellent maneuverability, long range and
endurance, silent operation, great payload capacity, et al.
Some of these requirements are mutually exclusive, which
precludes the possibility of creating a versatile underwater
platform suitable for a multitude of missions. The objective
of current study is to develop a robotic ﬁsh for real-world
exploration, probe and survey missions. Advanced underwa-
ter mobility, especially high cruising speed that is the most
important requirement of such missions, is realized with spe-
ciﬁc design and control solutions. The robotic ﬁsh emulates
thunniform propulsion optimized for high speed swimming
with an oscillating caudal ﬁn driven by a parallel four-
bar mechanism. A rigid torpedo-shaped pressure hull, rather
than ﬂexible ﬁsh-shaped body, is adopted for the housing of
power, electronics and payload. The locomotion controller
is constructed based on a central pattern generator (CPG)
model to generate robust, smooth and coordinated oscillatory
control signals for the tail joints. Coupling terms that allow
direct speciﬁcation of phase shifts between translation and
rotation of the caudal ﬁn is formulated. The robotic ﬁsh
achieves a maximum speed of 2.0 m/s during stable straight
swimming and demonstrates excellent maneuverability. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the fastest speed that
robotic ﬁshes have achieved.
II. MECHATRONIC DESIGN OF ROBOTIC FISH
A. Prototype Overview
Thunniform swimming is typical of some of the fastest
marine vetebrates, such as scombrid ﬁsh, laminid sharks
and cetaceans. The propulsive movements of thunniform
swimmers are conﬁned to the posterior one-third of the
body. Thrust is generated primarily with a high aspect

ratio, crescent-shaped caudal ﬁn that undergoes a combined
translational and rotational motion. The proﬁle of attack
angle is properly controlled throughout the stroke cycle to
ensure high propulsive efﬁciency. These deﬁning features
of thunniform swimming have been implemented on the
mission-scale, free-swimming robotic ﬁsh. Fig. 1 illustrates
the mechanical conﬁgurations of the robotic ﬁsh.
The robotic ﬁsh employs a rigid torpedo-shaped body for
housing of power, electronics and payload. Compared with
the commonly used ﬂexible ﬁsh-shaped body, such a design
allows easy fabrication and excellent pressure resistance
ability. The tail thruster, attached to the rear end of the
hull, is composed of actuators, drive link assembly and a
lunate caudal ﬁn. Maxon RE40 DC motors are used as
the actuators due to their simple controllability, high-speed
operation and repeatability. The actuators are embedded in
large dorsal and ventral ﬁns, which are made of buoyancy
material and help maintain stability. The drive link assembly
is directly exposed to water, saving the energy to deform
any ﬂexible exostructures. The robotic ﬁsh is also equipped
with a pair of pectoral ﬁns, each actuated by a Hitec HS5645
servomotor. By adjusting the pitching angles of the pectoral
ﬁns, three-dimensional swimming as well as posture control
can be realized. Table I lists the technical speciﬁcations of
the robotic ﬁsh prototype.
B. Propulsive Mechanism
The propulsive mechanism that transmits motor torque to
the caudal ﬁn is based on a parallel four-bar mechanism. Fig.
2 shows the mechanical design and schematic illustration of
the propulsive mechanism. It consists of four links connected
by four revolute joints, forming a closed-loop mechanism.
Link 1 and 2 are input links, driven by two motors that are

installed coaxially at point O. The caudal ﬁn is attached to
link 4, which is L-shaped and rotates around the pivot at
the corner. The oscillating motion of the caudal ﬁn can be
precisely controlled by the motors via the parallel four-bar
mechanism.
The caudal ﬁn of robotic ﬁsh, acting as a lift-generating
hydrofoil, moves with a constant forward velocity and os-
cillates harmonically to trace a sinusoidal pathway that is
symmetrical about the longitudinal axis of the body and
in time. The harmonic oscillation of the caudal ﬁn can be
regarded as a combination of translational and rotational
motion speciﬁed at the leading edge

longitudinal axis,h

The oscillatory movement of the caudal ﬁn is determined
by the rotating angles of link 1 and 2. Given the kinematics
of the caudal ﬁn, the motor control law can be derived as

maneuvers by biasing the propulsive mechanism to one side
of the body. Offset angles will be superposed on both degrees
of freedom.

C. Electrical System
The on-board electrical system of the robotic ﬁsh provides
power, actuation, sensing, control and communication func-
tions. A high capacity rechargeable LiFePO4 battery pack
allows power autonomy of three hours at cruising speed.
The central control unit is a microcontroller STM32F103 that
incorporates a high performance 32-bit RISC, ARM Cortex-
M3 core running at 72 MHz from STMicroelectronics. The
DC motors are driven and controlled by two servo drivers
from UPTECH Robotics. The sensor suite includes depth
sensor, voltage sensor, current sensor and an AHRS unit.
High-level steering and speed inputs, as well as on-board
sensor readings are delivered through a duplex RF module.
Fig. 3 illustrates the block diagram of the electrical system.
III. CPG-BASED LOCOMOTION CONTROL
Locomotion control of the robotic ﬁsh can be achieved
with online gait generation and tracking control. The motor
control law speciﬁed by equation (3) and (4) can be used to
calculate the target angles for the tail joints, which will then
be sent to the servo drivers. The explicit relationship between
tail kinematics and the control law allows easy adjustment
of the swimming gait. However, online modiﬁcation of the
control parameters will cause discontinuous jump of joint
angles, which might damage the actuator and the propulsive
mechanism. Inspired by the neurobiological principle of lo-
comotor rhythmogenesis, CPG-based locomotion controller
have been designed and implemented on a variety of bio-
mimetic robots [11]. CPGs are specialized neuronal circuits
capable of producing coordinated patterns of rhythmic ac-
tivity without any rhythmic inputs from sensory feedback or
from higher control centers. The advantages of CPG-based
control approach include stable rhythm generation, smooth
gait transition, robustness to perturbation and easy integration
of sensory feedback signals. In this paper, a CPG controller
with explicit parameter controlling phase difference between
oscillatory CPG units is built for locomotion control of the
robotic ﬁsh.
In robotic applications, CPG is modeled as an assembly of
neural oscillators that spike periodically through reciprocal
inhibition. Among various mathematical models of neural
oscillator, Hopf oscillator is widely used as the basic oscilla-
tory unit of the CPG controller [12]–[14]. Hopf oscillator can
generate self-sustained sinusoidal oscillation and has explicit
parameters for setting frequency and amplitude. Its dynamic
behavior is described by the following nonlinear differential
equations

,u andv are state variables in Cartesian
space, ? > 0 controls the amplitude of the oscillation,
and ? speciﬁes the intrinsic frequency of the oscillator (in

is
determined by the initial condition. The analytical solution of
the oscillator facilitates parameter speciﬁcation for a desired
oscillation proﬁle. Furthermore, the limit cycle is structurally
stable, which means small perturbations will be forgotten and
the trajectory will converge back to the limit cycle.
Each CPG unit is responsible for generating the oscillatory
behavior of one tail joint. The state variableu of the oscilla-
tor is taken as the CPG output, which determines the target
angular position of the joint. In order to achieve appropriate
phasing between joints, the oscillators should be connected
together. The desired locomotor pattern given by equation (3)
and (4) can be realized with appropriate coupling scheme
and parameter setting. Generally, the coupling term from
one oscillator to another is implemented as an additive
perturbation, which inﬂuences phase dynamics of the forced
oscillator, leading to frequency synchronization and stable
phase shifts between them. However, the oscillation ampli-
tude of the forced oscillator will also be modiﬁed, which
makes it hard to specify parameter for a desired oscillation
amplitude. In order to eliminate this undesirable side effect,
the perturbation signal p is required to act on the state
variables of the forced oscillator in the following way [14]

It’s obvious that the amplitude remains unperturbed and only
the phase is affected, which means the perturbation acts only
in the direction tangential to the limit cycle.
Following the tail structure of the robotic ﬁsh, a CPG
network composed of two coupled Hopf oscillators, is con-
structed for generation of swimming gaits. For the sake of
simplicity, only descending couplings are assumed, which
follows that the rotational motion is perturbed by the trans-
lational motion. Fig. 4 shows the conﬁguration of the CPG
network. For the uni-directionally coupled network, desired
phase relation between oscillators can be realized with a

composite signal coming from the two state variables of
the forcing oscillator, which are π/2 out of phase [14].
Each of the state variables produces a phase-attractive force
on the phase point of the forced oscillator, resulting in
a tendency for in-phase synchronization. By adjusting the
relative strengths of components of the signal, a steady
phase-locked state with arbitrary phase difference can be
attained. However, tuning of the coupling strengths for a
desired phase relation presents a challenging problem, which
requires complex search, optimization or learning techniques.
In the present study, an alternative formulation of the cou-
pling model that allows direct speciﬁcation of the phase
relation is proposed. Instead of instantaneous coupling, the
oscillators is assumed to interact via time-delayed coupling.
Thus the forced oscillator can be modeled by

where ? is the coupling delay. With this setting, the forced
oscillator can be in-phase synchronized by the delayed state
of the forcing one. Delay of the state variable corresponds
to some phase shift in polar coordinates. By exploiting the

derive the following relation

Therefore the desired phase difference can be attained by
feeding weighted statesu andv of one oscillator to the other,
with sine and cosine functions of the phase difference as the
coupling weights.
The rhythm-generating ability of the CPG network has
been examined with numerical simulations. Fig. 5 shows the

totically converge to stable limit cycles. Tuning of the CPG
parameters enables the system to switch to new limit circles
quickly and smoothly. The desired phase difference has been
exactly exhibited by the two gaits, thereby validating the
effectiveness of the proposed coupling scheme.
IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
Experiments with the robotic ﬁsh are carried out in an
outdoor swimming pool with still water of 1.2 m in depth.
Swimming speed and maneuvering performances have been
the focus of the experiments.
A. Testing of Swimming Speed
In speed tests, the robotic ﬁsh is required to swim along
a straight line and the control parameters are ﬁxed in each
run. Measurements of average linear speed in steady state are
obtained using video analysis method. Fig. 6 shows a snap-
shot sequence of straight swimming. Kinematic parameters
that affect swimming speed include tail beating frequency,

tudes.

amplitude and phase difference between translation and
rotation. Several studies have revealed that maximum thrust
can be obtained with phase difference ofπ/2 [16], therefore
all tests have been conducted under this condition. Three
groups of amplitude are tested, with frequency varied in
each case. Fig. 7 shows the dependence of forward speed
on tail beating frequency and amplitude. As illustrated, the
forward speed increases almost linearly with the frequency,
and large amplitude can also provide more thrust. At higher
frequencies, the desired amplitudes can hardly be reached
and the speed saturates due to the performance limits of
the motors. At frequency of about 2.8 Hz, a maximum
speed of 2.0 m/s is reached, which is approximately 1.7
BL/s (body length per second). A thorough literature review
suggests that the robotic ﬁsh has outperformed all other
robotic ﬁsh prototypes in terms of both absolute speed and
length-speciﬁc speed.
The remarkable swimming speed is achieved at the ex-
pense of high power consumption. Due to the reciprocating
motion of the motors and the complex hydrodynamic loads
on the tail ﬁn, the instantaneous power consumed by the tail
thruster ﬂuctuates drastically. To calculate the average power
consumption, the following equation is employed

versus swimming speed. Notice that the measured power
is the total power consumed by the propulsion system. In
order to reduce power consumption and increase propulsive
efﬁciency of the robotic ﬁsh, proper selection of kinematic
parameters, optimized design of the drive link assembly and
vortex sensing and control techniques should be investigated.
B. Testing of Maneuvering Performances
Planar turning maneuvers of the robotic ﬁsh is tested by
biasing the propulsive mechanism to one side of the robot. In
order to achieve tail biasing, the state variableu of the CPG
model is substituted by a new variableu
?
=u?o, whereo is
an offset angle. Fig. 9 shows a snapshot sequence of circular
turning maneuvers. The performance of turning maneuvers
can be evaluated in terms of turning radius and turning rate.
In all tests, the same offset angle has been applied to the two
tail joints. The dependence of turning performance on offset
angle as well as tail beating frequency is illustrated in Fig.
10 and Fig. 11. For a constant frequency, the turning radius
decreases while the turning rate increases with increasing
offset angle. The increase of frequency results in larger
turning rate, but the turning radius changes only slightly.
It should be remarked that the robotic ﬁsh can turn with a
very small turning radius when the tail ﬂaps very slowly
(for instance, below 0.3 Hz). Such an extreme maneuver
can hardly be used in practice and is not considered in the
experiments. A minimum turning radius of 0.92 BL and a
maximum turning rate of 58 deg/s are achieved with offset
angle of 50 deg and tail beating frequency of 2.8 Hz.
Thunniform swimmers, optimized for high-speed swim-
ming, are not well-suited for turning maneuvers. Compared
with robotic ﬁsh swimming with anguilliform or carangiform
mode, the developed robotic ﬁsh turns with larger turning
radius and cannot perform C-shaped sharp turning. However,
the turning performances achieved by the robotic ﬁsh are
outstanding among its kind. The VCUUV robotic ﬁsh, driven

frequencies.

by a four-joint caudal ﬁn, achieves a minimum turning
radius of 1 BL and a maximum turning rate of 75 deg/s
[2]. The SPC-III robotic ﬁsh, a predecessor of the current
robot, also achieves a minimum turning radius of 1 BL, but
the maximum turning rate is only 35 deg/s [3]. Although
the robotic ﬁsh is designed as a cruising-type underwater
platform, the excellent maneuverability enables it to perform
close inspection, rapid course adjustment and operation in
cluttered environments.
V. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORKS
The emulation of ﬁsh swimming for UUV propulsion
presents exciting possibilities for mobility improvements
over traditional designs. The robotic ﬁsh presented in this
paper, by adopting thunniform kinematics and mechanical
design of high thrust-to-mass ratio, has been able to achieve
signiﬁcant speed and excellent maneuverability. The CPG
controller allows generation of smooth, adaptive and coor-
dinated oscillatory control signals for the tail joints. Exper-
imental results have veriﬁed the effectiveness of proposed
design and control approaches.
Future work will include dynamic modeling of the robot
and experimental characterization of its propulsive efﬁciency.
Design, sensing and control techniques for efﬁcient swim-
ming will be explored and investigated experimentally. A
more sophisticated control system capable of mission plan-
ning and decision making will be developed for autonomous
operation in real-world UUV missions.
