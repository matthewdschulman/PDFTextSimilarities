AbstractÑWe introduce the Partial View Heat Kernel
(PVHK) descriptor, for the purpose of 3D object representation
and recognition from partial views, assumed to be partial
object surfaces under self occlusion. PVHK describes partial
views in a geometrically meaningful way, i.e., by establishing
a unique relation between the shape of the view and the
descriptor. PVHK is also stable with respect to sensor noise and
therefore adequate for sensors, such as the current active 3D
cameras. Furthermore, PVHK takes full advantage of the dual
3D/RGB nature of current sensors and seamlessly incorporates
appearance information onto the 3D information. We formally
deÞne the PVHK descriptor, discuss related work, provide
evidence of the PVHK properties and validate them in three
purposefully diverse datasets, and demonstrate its potential for
recognition tasks.
I. INTRODUCTION
We address the 3D representation of objects from multiple
3D partial views, where each partial view is the visible
surface of the object as seen from a view angle, with no
occlusion from other objects. Fig. 1 illustrates a partial view
deÞned in terms of the position of the camera sensor with
respect to the object.

respect to an object centered coordinate system.
Partial views are the returned surfaces of sensors as the
object self occludes part of its complete 3D surface. We
investigate the 3D representation of the complete object as
a set of partial views. We are also interested in common

sensor cameras, such as the Kinect sensor, that combine
RGB and depth information, but are also noisy. To address
these multiple challenges and goals, we introduce a new
representation for partial views, the Partial View Heat Kernel
(PVHK) descriptor, which is:
1) Informative, i.e., a single descriptor robustly describes
each partial view;
2) Stable, i.e., small perturbations on the surface yield
small perturbations on the descriptor;
3) Inclusive, i.e., appearance properties, such as texture,
can be seamlessly incorporated into the geometry-
based descriptor.
The combination of these three characteristics results in a
representation especially suitable for partial views captured
from noisy RGB+Depth sensors during robot navigation
or manipulation where the object surfaces are visible with
limited, if any, occlusion.
To ensure that the descriptor is informative, PVHK builds
upon a measure related to geodesic-distances to represent
distances, over the surface, between a reference point, o
?
,
and the boundary, as illustrated in Fig. 2. The ordered set of
all the distances represents surfaces in a unique way, apart
from symmetric and isometric transformations.

To ensure that the descriptor is stable with respect to noise
and topological artifacts, e.g., holes or small occlusions, we
rely on diffusive geometry concepts to represent average
distances ([1], [2]). Concretely, we model the averaging
process as the propagation along the surface of the heat
placed at a source. Hence, PVHK represents a partial view
as the temperature at boundary as a result of a heat pulse in
the reference point o
?
.
The stability of the descriptor has a further advantage in
that changes in the view angle do not drastically change the
surface temperature. Hence, the descriptor varies smoothly
with the view angle, which is desirable when representing

objects from partial views. When close view angles generate
very different descriptors, the representation of complete
objectsrequiresalargenumberofpartialviews.Bychanging
slowly, PVHK requires a limited set of partial views.
Finally, to ensure seamless integration of heterogeneous
information, such as surface color, PVHK treats different
visual properties as different heat propagations velocities.
As heterogeneous velocities lead to different temperature
proÞles on identical 3D shapes, PVHK uniquely represents
objects with the same geometry but different color or texture.
Furthermore, while color position within the object alters the
descriptor,thechangeisnotsensitivetolowleveldetails.For
example, when applying the descriptor to the representation
of people, the change is not sensitive to facial features.
The paper is organized as follows: Section II introduces
the datasets used; in Section III discusses related work and
reviews the previously introduced Heat Kernel; Section IV
introduces our PVHK descriptor, and presents its main
characteristics; Section V presents results from two main
studied applications; and in Section VI we draw conclusions
and address future work directions.
II. DATASETS
In this work, we use three partial view datasets: Dataset-I
(Fig. 3), Dataset-II (Fig. 4), and Dataset-III (Fig. 5), which
respectively correspond to 3D computer models of rigid
objects, to real rigid objects, and to real non-rigid objects.
Fig. 3. Dataset-I: (a) box, (b) mug, (c) cylinder and (d) toy castle.
We use Dataset-I to illustrate and compare aspects of both
PVHK and other descriptors and therefore require a Þne
control on the acquisition parameters. We obtain the partial
views by rendering the 3D models using spatial and depth
resolution similar to that of a Kinect camera. We also add
to the depth image a noise proportional to distance, [3], We
simulate the camera at a distance of 1m and view angles,

We use Dataset-II to provide empirical evidence on the
accuracy of our representation under real sensor conditions.
With a Kinect camera, we collected two sets of partial views,

correspond to a known and dense sampling on the observer

We use Dataset-III to illustrate the use both color and 3D
information and applicability of the descriptor on non-rigid
objects. We use partial views of a human in a variety of
different positions, also collected using a Kinect camera.
The datasets include objects that share strong similarities
in terms of size and shape, e.g., cylinders, cups, and mugs.
Furthermore, the objects and partial views have different

topologies, to demonstrate the generality of the introduced
PVHK descriptor. Using the datasets we intent to illustrate
and provide a rich empirical evaluation of our introduced
PVHK descriptor.
III. RELATED WORK
We view two ways to represent individual partial views,
namely(i)asasetoflocalfeaturesand(ii)asasingleholistic
feature. We present a brief overview on both alternatives,
with emphasis on the holistic features as they provide the
background and motivation for PVHK.
A. Local Features
Local features are common to represent partial views,
since a small set of features can represent complex objects.

1055
For example, Fig. 6 shows the Þve different features required
to represent the box and castle from Dataset-I: three types
of corners (P2, P4 and P5), an edge (P2), and a plane (P1).

Since local representations describe only a small portion
of an object, recognition algorithms either solve Þrst a regis-
tration problem or combine features into bags of features,
similar to bags of words. Consequently descriptors need
to be invariant to changes in pose. Several representations
achieve this by describing the feature on a tangent space
to the object surface at each point, since this space is not
only invariant to changes in pose as is easy to reproduce.
Examples of such representations are the Fast Point Feature
Histogram (FPFH) [4], Signatures of Histograms of Orien-
Tations(SHOT) [5], Local Surface Patches(LSP) [6], Spin
Images (SI) [7], and Intrinsic Shape Signatures (ISS) [8]
However, methods for estimating the tangent space are
sensitive to noise because they rely on normal estimation.
As we illustrate in Fig. 7, this negatively reßects on the
descriptors. In the Þgure, we show the variance of different
representations as the distance, d, between object and sensor
increases, increasing the noise. We estimate the variance
by computing the descriptor of the same point over 40
point clouds generated for each value of d. As descriptors
have high dimensionality, we represent the variance as ratio
between the maximum eigenvalue of the covariant matrix
and the mean descriptor. The point used for comparison is
P1 from Fig. 6 and the descriptors correspond to SHOT,
FPFH, and a holistic partial view representation, View Point
Histogram, that we include for comparison purposes.

B. Holistic Partial View Features
By describing a larger surface, holistic partial view rep-
resentations are more stable to noise, even when deÞned
on tangent space. E.g., the Viewpoint Feature Histogram
(VFH) [9] is an extention of FPFH to the whole partial view
but has a lower variance, as we show in Fig. 7
To altogether avoid tangent space estimation, other repre-
sentations build upon distances between points on the object
surface. E.g., representations for complete objects can be
build from the distribution of euclidian distances between
points [10]. Extentions to account also for topological in-
formation, e.g., [11], are constructed by classifying whether
lines connecting pairs of points lay inside the object surface
or not. The later was also extended to partial views as
Ensemble of Shape Functions, (ESF) [12].
The discriminative power resulting from topological infor-
mation comes at the cost of an increased sensitivity to holes
in the surface due to sensor noise. A more robust approach
relies on the use of diffusive distances [1] as a noise resilient
surrogate to shortest path distances on object surface.
Diffusive distances are related with diffusive processes
occurring over a surface. Diffusive processes can be in-
terpreted as a sequence of local averaging steps applied
to a function representing some quantity, e.g., temperature.
The averaging steps dilute local non-homogeneities in the
function and effectively transport the quantity from regions
of higher values to regions of lower values.
Fig. 8 shows two examples of diffusive processes taking
place on similar surfaces, different only on account of a hole.
In the Þrst example, Fig. 8(a) to Fig. 8(c), the temperature
evolves from an initial source to the whole partial view fol-
lowing a concentric pattern, associated with the shortest path
between points, until reaching the partial view boundaries.
In the second example, Fig. 8(d) to Fig. 8(f), while the hole
affects the shortest path between points, it does not strongly
effect the temperature. The averaging steps result in that the
temperature at a point is deÞned Þrst by the neighborhood
and only implicitly depends on the distance to the source.

Diffusive processes can describe local features, such as
the Heat Kernel Signature (HKS) [2] and the Scale Invariant
1056
Heat Kernel Signature [13]. HKS is a highly robust local
descriptor that contains large scale information. HKS repre-
sents a point with the temperature evolution after placing,
and immediately removing, a heat source on that point. The
evolution depends on how fast the temperature propagates
to the neighborhood, which in turn depends on the object
geometry.Whilebothdescriptors,HKSandSI-HKS,perform
well on complete 3D shapes, the same point on an object
surface may have different descriptors depending on the
partial view. Accordingly, matching features across partial
views using HKS or SI-HKS is not feasible.
C. Shape and Appearance
Current representations may not extend naturally to in-
clude object appearance, i.e., color and/or texture.
Some approaches, e.g., [14], [15], resort to extending ad-
hoc the descriptor dimension to include some color/texture
descriptor on the extra dimensions. However, the joint de-
scriptors do not effectively associate appearance features
with positions in the object.
On the other hand, the photometric heat kernel [16],
directlyassociatesappearanceto3Dcoordinatesbychanging
the space where the object is deÞned. I.e., each point in
the surface lays in a 6D space with physical coordinates
plus RGB values. The formalism used for diffusive process
extends naturally to this new space, however it takes into
account only color gradients and not absolute information,
which may hinder recognition.
Given all the above, we see that heat kernel provides a
noise resilient representation of distances and has already
proved to easily extendable to include color. Thus, we use
the heat propagation as a substitute for a set of representative
distances over a partial view: the ordered set of distances
between boundary points and a single point in the object sur-
face, as we previously illustrated in Fig. 2. By its importance
to our proposed representation, we here brießy review the
heat kernel and its underlying process. (The familiar reader
can step to the next section.)

ToensurethatPVHKconsistentlydeÞnesavisiblesurface,
we choose v
s
as the point closest to the observer, as we can
easily Þnd the point for each view angle. Additionally, the
value of t
s
must be large enough to ensure that the heat has
time to reach the boundary, but also that the equilibrium is
not reached, i.e., that not all the points in the surface are at
thesametemperature.Sincebotheventsdependonthepartial

A. Stability and Smoothness
The stability ensures that PVHK changes smoothly with
respect to changes in the view angle. Changes in the view
angle lead to (i) the source moving over the object, as the
closest point to the observer changes; and (ii) the visible
surface of the object, including the boundary, changing. As
long as there are no severe changes on the object surface,
both changes happen smoothly.
The smoothness impact is two fold: (i) it guarantees that
the set of descriptors for a given object are contained in a
Þnite and contiguous portion of the descriptors space, which
is important for classiÞcation with discriminative methods;
(ii) it guarantees that descriptors associated with similar
view angles are also similar, which reduces the error on
applications with view angle estimation.
In Fig. 9 we highlight both characteristics in PVHK on 2D
Isomap projections, [17], of four representations applied to
Dataset I. Dots corresponds to partial views, as illustrated in
9(a) for the rectangular box, and connected dots are contigu-
ous view angles. The other representations are the VFH and
ESF, from the Point Cloud Library [18] implementation; and
SI-HKS,fromourownimplementation.Fromtheprojections
we see that ESF and PVHK are more effective at separating
objects, since partial views from different objects do not get
mixed in a 2D projection. However, ESF does not change as
smoothly with the view angle as PVHK, notably in the cup
and the castle example.

We also note that SI-HKS bag of features approach for
combining local features, while robust at discriminating
between complete objects, is not suitable for partial views.
As the heat kernel signature of a single point depends on the
complete visible surface, there is a greater variability in the
descriptor from changes in the view point.
B. Adding Texture
We introduce texture intoPVHK representation by slightly
modifying the heat equation. The heat equation assumes the
whole surface propagates heat at the same rate. By locally
using different rates, we generate different the descriptors for
objectswiththesamegeometry.Thus,todifferentiateobjects
on both appearance and geometry, we associate appearance
with propagation rate. We thus rewrite the heat equation as:
Lh(v,v
s
,t) =c(v)¶
t
h(v,v
s
,t), (6)
where c(v) :V?R is any scalar function associated with
color, or texture, at vertex v.
The solution to the non-homogeneous problem in Eq. 6
is identical to the solution to the homogeneous problem in
Eq. 1, but ? and ? are now the solution of the generalized
eigenvalue problem L

Our proposed approach differs from previous efforts to
combine color and geometry, in particular from [16]. No-
tably, we can extend the function c(v) to represent any scalar
quantityandnotjustcolor.Examplesofusefulscalarsarethe
color hue value or cluster indices, e.g., after some clustering
preprocessing using any other appearance representation.
We illustrate the impact of adding appearance information
to the descriptor by considering a person in the same posi-
tion, wearing the same clothes but with different colors, as in
Fig. 10. We assume that our scalar function c(v) corresponds
to the color hue value when scaled to the interval [0.5,1] and
present the temperature along the boundary in the graphic
on Fig. 10. The four descriptors present a common behavior
associated with shape, e.g., the head, point l
1
, introduces
the same decrease in the temperature. However, the color
modulates the temperature in a very signiÞcant way. Notably,
the color at the source, which in the example is placed in
the blouse, leads to the gap betweenOriginal+DifferentSkirt
and Different Blouse + Different Dress.

V. APPLICATIONS
We envision mainly two applications for PVHK: (i) recog-
nition of rigid objects, and (ii) tracking of articulated shapes.
A. Recognition
We show the effectiveness of PVHK at object recognition
on Dataset-II, without using color. ClassiÞcation was based
onnearestneighbors,usinganL2-norm.AsPVHKisdeÞned
over aclosedcurve, itisambiguous over circularshifts.Thus
the nearest neighbor search considers all such shifts.
Fig. 11. Confusion matrix for PVHK testing
Fig. 11 presents the a confusion matrix that relates the
true view angle of each element on the testing dataset, on
the x-axis, to the view angle of the closest descriptor from
the training dataset, on the y-axis. The confusion matrix
shows that most miss classiÞcations correspond to similar
objects, e.g., the cream pitcher and the mug. The matrix
shows also the inner category confusion that we expect in
objects with strong symmetries, such as the drinking glass.
The overall accuracy was 95% and the accuracy for each
class is represent in the column to the right of the matrix.
B. Tracking of Articulated Shapes
Deformations on clothes and body due to movement make
tracking articulated shapes, such as humans, very chal-
lenging. However, the heat kernel is invariant to isometric
deformations, which means that PVHK will also be resilient
to most deformations and not change with movement.
Using the Dataset-III, we estimate the PVHK descriptor
for different poses of a human moving between the six posi-
tionsinFig.5.Fig.12presentsthe2DIsomapprojectionand
respectivelabelsforthedataset.SpeciÞcally,theÞgureshows
the separation of descriptors into two groups associated with
the position of the arms with respect to the body.
The results in Fig. 12 imply that, while using our proposed
descriptor PVHK, an articulated body can be represented
by a reduced number of rigid shapes. Consequently, hint
that tracking and recognition, if aided by including color
or texture information, can be easily achieved.

VI. CONCLUSIONS
Inthisworkweintroduce apartialviewrepresentation and
demonstrate that it is informative, stable to perturbations and
effective at representing both geometry and appearance.
PVHK is especially suitable when there is little occlusion
from other objects. We thus forsee a large spectrum of
applications ranging from robot manipulation, where there is
only the target object present, to robot controlled perception,
where the robot can move to avoid occlusions.
Furthermore, the color extension of PVHK is able to
represent color distributions over geometry, which opens the
door to many other applications. We highlight its adequacy
for tracking humans in a contained environment, where, by
being insensitive to low level details of the face and to most
deformations, PVHK allows for anonymity and robustness.
