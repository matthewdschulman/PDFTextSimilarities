Toward Parallel Continuum Manipulators
Caroline E. Bryson, and D. Caleb Rucker Member, IEEE
Abstract—In this paper, we investigate continuum manipula-
tors that are analogous to conventional rigid-link parallel robot
designs. These “parallel continuum manipulators” have the
potential to inherit some of the compactness and compliance of
continuum robots while retaining some of the precision, stabil-
ity, and strength of rigid-link parallel robots, yet they represent
a relatively unexplored area of the broad manipulator design
space. We describe the construction of a prototype manipulator
structurewithsixcompliantlegsconnectedinaparallelpattern
similar to that of a Stewart-Gough platform. We formulate
the static forward and inverse kinematics problems for such
manipulators as the solution to multiple Cosserat-rod models
with coupled boundary conditions, and we test the accuracy of
this approach in a set of experiments, including the prediction
of leg buckling. An inverse kinematics simulation of slices
through the 6 degree-of-freedom (DOF) workspace illustrates
the kinematic mapping, range of motion, and force required
for actuation, which sheds light on the potential advantages
and tradeoffs that parallel continuum manipulators may bring.
Potential applications include miniature wrists and arms for
endoscopicmedicalprocedures,andlightweightcompliantarms
for safe interaction with humans.
I. INTRODUCTION
Continuum manipulators have historically been consid-
ered serial devices, perhaps because they typically have a
long slender form, and the dominant geometric modeling
paradigm is constant curvature arc segments tangentially
connected in series, as reviewed in [1]. However, as some
researchers have noted, many continuum designs also contain
aspects resembling parallel architectures. For example, mul-
tiple entities are often constrained and connected in parallel
within a single arc segment to achieve 2-DOF bending
actuation (e.g. pneumatic muscles [2], multi-backbone de-
signs [3], multiple embedded tendons [4]–[6], and concentric
precurved tubes [7], [8]). Thus, the majority of existing
continuum robots would most accurately be categorized
as either serial or hybrid manipulators. In this paper, we
consider continuum robot designs that are directly analogous
to conventional rigid-link parallel robots. These “parallel
continuum manipulators” constitute a relatively unexplored
quadrant of the broad manipulator design space shown in
Figure 1.
The continuum robots most closely related to this concept
are snake-like multi-backbone designs, such as [3]. These
employ a series of several bending segments, each of which
is actuated by the translation of three parallel backbone rods.
These parallel rods are constrained by several intermediate

spacer disks such that the robot shape can be described by
a series of frames along a single backbone curve. Use of a
3-DOF parallel continuum wrist design was also shown by
Simaan in [9]. Similarly, the the bionic tripod manipulator
from the German company Festo uses four ﬂexible actuation
rods connected in parallel through an intermediate constraint
platform [10].
In the parallel robot research literature, ﬂexible parallel
robots have been studied extensively, as detailed in [11].
Past work has studied planar parallel robots with compliant
links [12]–[15], as well as ﬂexible Stewart platforms [16],
[17], and the typical concern is with small link deformations
that occur due to external or inertial loads. Parallel robots
with ﬂexure joints have also been studied, including and
ﬂexure-jointed 6 DOF platforms [18]–[21], high-precision
robots [22], [23], mechanisms for micro/nano-manipulation
[24], [25], and 3 DOF translation platforms [26]. In medical
robotics, parallel robots with elastic actuation and ﬂexure
joints have been developed for rehabilitation [27], [28], and
capsule endoscopy [29]. Parallel continuum robots differ in
that they exhibit large, nonlinear, link deﬂections by design,

and bending is distributed along the entire link rather than
lumped at a speciﬁc a point. A patent application [30] by
Zhu, et al. describes the essential concept of a parallel
continuum manipulator from this perspective.
Thus, parallel continuum manipulators build on several
ideas presented in prior work, yet the concept has not been
fully explored with respect to modeling, analysis, design, and
control. In the following sections, we present some progress
toward these goals by describing the design and construction
of a prototype parallel continuum structure and deriving a
general kinematic modeling approach based on Cosserat rod
theory. Then, we investigate the kinematic capabilities of our
prototype and experimentally evaluate model accuracy.
A. Concept and Motivation
The basic design paradigm of a parallel continuum robot is
illustrated in Figure 2. The distal ends of multiple compliant
legs are connected in some pattern to an end effector plat-
form, and the base of each leg is independently translated
by an actuator at its proximal end. There may also be
some additional constraints on the relative positions of the
rods at a certain point (e.g. linear bearings where the rods
pass through a base platform). One can conceive of several
different variations of parallel continuum robot designs. As
with rigid-link parallel manipulators, kinematic behavior is
deﬁned by the number of legs and the types of actuation and
constraints at each end, which could vary from spherical to
clamped joints (our prototype manipulator in Figure 3 uses
clamped joints). The elastic legs themselves could be initially
straight or have generally precurved stress free states, which
could alter the kinematic properties of the device. Using
tubes for the legs would allow wires or other infrastructure to
be passed through their hollow center channels to the distal
platform in order to actuate a gripper or other end effector.
Using tubes would also enable hybrid “stacked” designs to
be constructed (similar to multi-segment, snake-like designs,
except with more degrees of freedom per segment) where the
legs of a secondary parallel continuum mechanism extend out
the ends the tubes through the distal platform of the primary
mechanism.
In comparison to serial continuum robots, parallel con-
tinuum designs are likely to have higher payload capacity
and accuracy/repeatability. Compared to rigid-link parallel
manipulators, they may exhibit greater compliance, larger
workspace, and easier miniaturization to the the scale of
a few millimeters in diameter or smaller. Their inherent
mechanical compliance and low mass due to off-loading
of the actuators can provide an important safety feature
wherever parallel robots need to interact with humans. In
the ﬁeld of endoscopic robotic surgery, parallel continuum
manipulators have the potential to provide precise, multi-
DOF motion in a simple, compact, and short mechanism at
the tip of an endoscope. This capability may be useful for
manipulating objects within highly conﬁned spaces where
a long slender body would be constrained by anatomical
structures. In these cases, access to the site could be gained
through ﬂexible endoscopy, and then a parallel continuum

device could provide ﬁne, multi-DOF motion at the tip
location (actuated by rods passing through hollow channels).
II. PROTOTYPE DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION
In this section we describe the construction of a parallel
continuum manipulator prototype structure designed to show
proof-of-concept and study parallel continuum robot behav-
ior. The prototype has six compliant legs connected in a sim-
ilar arrangement to the legs of a 6-DOF rigid-link Stewart-
Gough platform, and each leg can be manually actuated.
The legs consist of 1.3 mm diameter spring steel music wire
(ASTM A228) with an estimated Young’s modulus of 207
GPa and Poisson’s ratio of 0.305. As shown in Figure 3, these
rods are connected to an end-effector plate of clear1=16 inch
acrylic via 3=8 inch OD shaft collars constrained in channels
within small blocks attached to the plate. The rods are routed
through holes in the base plate, and the proximal ends are
connected to linear slide carriages in the same fashion. The
carriages translate along T-slotted aluminum rails (80/20
R 
Inc.) that are bolted in a hexagonal pattern to the base plate.
The linear slide carriages can be manually repositioned and
locked in place with a brake so that the length of each rod
between the base plate and the end plate can be actuated
independently.
The connection locations of the 6 ﬂexible legs are arranged
in a conventional radial hexapod pattern of 3 pairs of rods
spaced 120

apart at a radius of 87 mm. As depicted by the
numbers in Figure 3, the proximal holes for rods 1 and 2 are
paired together (with a total separation of 20

), while at the
end plate the connections for rods 2 and 3 are paired together.
The same pattern follows for the other pairs of wires. Rods
3 and 4, and 5 and 6 are paired at the base plate, while 4
and 5, and 6 and 1 are paired at the distal end. In the neutral
conﬁguration shown in Figure 4 with all leg lengths equal,

approach. Close-up views of the base and end platforms are shown to the left. The dimensions and patterns of the base plate pass-through holes and the

this connection pattern causes the top plate to be rotated by

with respect to the hole pattern in the base plate and
causes all of the rods to bend from their naturally straight
state.
III. MODELING APPROACH
Building off of prior work on concentric-tube continuum
robots [8] and tendon actuated continuum robots [4], we
adopt a kinematic modeling approach for parallel continuum
robots that is based on classical Cosserat rod mechanics
[31]. The framework outlined in the following subsections
addresses the forward and inverse kinematics and statics
problems.

As derived in [4], [8], [31], the rates of change of the
internal force vectorn and internal moment vectorm with
respect to the arc length s

are described by the classical

The kinematic variablesv

strain (shear, extension, bending, and torsion) and can be
used to calculate the internal force and moment vectors

in global coordinates) via a material constitutive law. For

Thus, for each rod, equations 1, 3, and 4 form a system
of differential equations that describes the evolution of the
state variablesp

with respect to s

B. Boundary Conditions for Forward Kinematics
Each rod or tube in a parallel continuum robot is inde-
pendently described by the system of differential equations
above. However, the boundary conditions of each system are
coupled because of the physical constraints inherent to the
robot structure.
For the prototype robot design which we describe in
Section II, the proximal end of each rod is clamped with a
set-screw shaft collar constrained within a groove in acrylic
block, and each rod subsequently passes through a cylindrical
hole in the base platform as shown in Figure 3. This design
constrains the positionp
i
and the rod tangent vector at the
base platform while allowing rotational freedom about the
tangent axis so that no torsional moment can be supported.
Thus, we set the torsional moment to zero at the base of each
rod and express R
i
(0) as a rotation about the global z-axis
by some angle 

as follows:

At the distal end of each rod (s

where F and M are external force and moment vectors
applied at the centroid of the top plate, p

connections of the distal end of the rods to the top plate are
modeled by setting the material orientations of each rod at

where log() is the matrix natural logarithm, which maps
SO(3) to so(3), and the_ operator subsequently maps so(3)
toR

. This forces a common material orientation for all the
distal rod ends.
Finally, we can write the following equations for the rod
end positions.

i
is the connection position for rod i expressed
with respect to the top plate coordinate system. These are
analogous to loop closure equations because they are only
satisﬁed when the positions of the rod ends have the same
relative positions as the connection pattern in the top plate.
C. Boundary Conditions for Inverse Kinematics
For the inverse kinematics problem, the boundary condi-
tions given above in (5) and (6) still apply, but the geometric
coupling of the rods at the distal platform is simpliﬁed by the
fact that a desired position and orientation is known. This can
be expressed by a constraint on the position and orientation
of each distal leg end as follows:

(9)
where p

and R
d
are the desired position (of the centroid)
and orientation of the distal platform. We note that these
equations are applied for i = 1:::n, so there are a total of
six more scalar constraint equations to be solved than in the
forward kinematics case, and the leg lengths constitute n
additional unknowns.
D. Numerical Computation
A simple shooting method provides an effective way to
solve the systems of rod equations subject to these cou-
pled boundary conditions. In this procedure, the unknown
boundary conditions at the base of each rod (n
i
(0),m
ix
(0),
m
iy
(0), and 
i
) are guessed (in the inverse kinematics case,
the leg lengthsL
i
are included in this set of unknowns). Each
system of rod equations is numerically integrated froms
i
=
0 toL
i
as an initial value problem using a standard numerical
routine such as a Runge-Kutta method, and the boundary
condition equations are subsequently evaluated. This process
is nested within an optimization loop which iteratively up-
dates the guessed values for the unknown proximal boundary
conditions until the distal boundary conditions are satisﬁed
within an appropriate tolerance. We have found this to be
an efﬁcient and relatively stable method of computation. For
the examples shown in the experimental section, convergence
was achieved in every case, starting with an uninformed
initial guess of zero for all unknown proximal conditions.
Computation time was on the order of 10 seconds using
unoptimized MATLAB code executed on a typical laptop
computer. Computation time decreases to about 1 second if
a good initial guess is available, which enables simulation of
quasistatic motion since a previous solution can be used as
the initial guess for the next iteration.
E. Multiple Solutions and Buckling Behavior
In contrast to rigid-link robots, the forward and inverse
kinematics problems for parallel continuum manipulators are
both complex (with the potential for multiple solutions pos-
sible) due to the large-deﬂection elastic behavior involved.
For our numerical computation strategy above, the set of
values for the unknown initial conditions (and leg lengths
in the case of inverse kinematics) which satisﬁes the distal
end boundary conditions may not always be unique. In
this context, the phenomena of “buckling” describes the
sudden transition of one valid solution to another one,
781
Fig. 4. We show photographs of ﬁve experimental conﬁgurations, demonstrating the ability of our prototype parallel continuum manipulator to execute
axial twist, transverse tilt, translation, and bending (simultaneous translation and tilt). To the right of each experimental photograph, we show a MATLAB
rendering of our rod-mechanics-based kinematic model prediction for the same actuator conﬁgurations.
which may occur when a particular equilibrium solution
becomes unstable (or ceases to exist) as the result of a
small change in actuation or external loading. The model
equations are still valid in these situations, and they contain
the ability to accurately describe all possible “buckled” states
if the correct solution for the initial conditions is selected.
The quasistatic simulation process described above tends to
produce the correct solution until a point of instability is
reached. The potential for buckling and instability exists for
all continuum robots when external loads are considered,
and for some designs even without external loading (e.g.
concentric-tube robots). Snap-through instabilities have been
studied for particular continuum robots [33], [34], but further
work is needed to address methods for detecting and avoiding
potential buckling in continuum robots.
IV. KINEMATIC SIMULATION AND ANALYSIS
Figure 4 demonstrates the kinematic degrees of freedom
and range of motion of our prototype manipulator structure
by showing the manipulator shape in ﬁve different con-
ﬁgurations. With all leg lengths equal, the robot is in a
straight, neutral state, which can be raised or lowered by
equal translation of the legs. By extending legs 2, 4, and
6, the distal platform twists about the z-axis. Translating
legs 4 and 5 causes the platform to tilt, and translating
legs 3 and 6 causes translation. A combination of rotation
and translation (bending) is achieved by extending legs 4
and 5 while retracting legs 1 and 2. The collection of legs
maintains a compact form throughout all these motions,
which is encouraging for potential applications in conﬁned
spaces. Figure 4 also shows a rendering of our forward
kinematics model solution for these ﬁve cases, indicating the
feasibility and qualitative accuracy of the modeling approach
over a wide range of motion. We provide further quantitative
assessment of model accuracy in Section V.
To further illustrate the kinematics of the prototype de-
sign, we give the body-frame manipulator Jacobian, J
b
as
deﬁned in [32], which we computed numerically for the
prototype manipulator in the neutral conﬁguration (where all
leg lengths are 406 mm, and the rotation is aligned with the
global reference frame.),

where the top 3 rows are dimensionless, and the bottom three
rows have units of degrees/mm. The matrix is full rank and
well conditioned, indicating that in the neutral conﬁguration,
actuators can easily move the top platform in any direction
in the 6 DOF space of rigid body motion.
In Figure 5, we depict the inverse kinematic mapping over
3 two-dimensional slices of the workspace. The ﬁgure shows
the required leg length and axial tension at the base of each

(c) and axial tension at the base of each leg (f) are plotted as a function of desired displacement along and rotation about the global z axis while holding
all other pose variables constant.
The ﬁrst case (Figure 5: (a) and (d)) shows an approxi-
mately linear kinematic mapping for desired rotation about
the x and y axes. The second case (Figure 5: (b) and (e))
shows an approximately quadratic leg length mapping and an
approximately linear tension mapping for desired translation
in the x y plane. We note that in this case, the required
lengths and tensions are identical for legs 1 and 4, 2 and 5,
and 3 and 6 respectively. The ﬁnal case (Figure 5: (c) and
(f)) shows an approximately linear leg length mapping and
an approximately cubic tension mapping for desired motion
which both rotates about and translates along the global z
axis. In this case, the lengths and tensions are identical for
legs 1, 3, and 5, and 2, 4, and 6 respectively.
The axial tension at the base of each leg corresponds to
the actuator force which would be required to hold the robot
in a particular conﬁguration. We conclude that over these
ranges of motion, moderate forces on the order of 5 N will
be required to actuate the structure. A simulation of this
kind can be used in the design process to size motors for
a particular set of manipulator structural parameters, and to
limit the length that the legs extend below the base platform
to avoid buckling.
We can also compute the output stiffness matrix at the
top platform, which maps displacement of the end effector
centroid to applied force dF = Kdp
c
. For the neutral
conﬁguration in Figure 4, the computed stiffness matrix is
K =

while for the bending conﬁguration in Figure 4, the stiffness
matrix is computed to be
K =
h
12:7 0 12:8
0 0:5 0
12:8 0 14:5

N=mm:
These computations show that the stiffness in they direction
(out of the page for the bending case in Figure 4), is only
about 3% of its value in the straight case, which is consistent
with our experience with this prototype. We conclude that
care should be taken when designing and controlling a
parallel continuum manipulator to ensure that output stiffness
is sufﬁcient for the desired tasks.
V. EXPERIMENTAL VALIDATION
We performed a set of model validation experiments by
photographing the shape of our prototype manipulator in
front of a graph poster in 14 different actuator conﬁgurations,
which are listed in Table I. Figure 6 shows the basic
elements of each image that were measured, the top platform
centroid and orientation in the global x z plane. These
measurements were then compared to our forward kinematics
model prediction for each actuator conﬁguration. The photos
of these planar cases were taken perpendicular to the graph
plane approximately 30 feet away from the robot so that
perspective error was minimized.
The resulting differences between the data and the model
prediction are presented in Table I. The positional error was
calculated as the total Cartesian error in the global x z
plane, and the percent error was calculated as the position
error divided by the average leg length for each case. The
maximum positional error was 11.74 mm with a 2.89%

effector edge and then measuring the slope of the line with the grid poster.

associated percent error. For the conﬁgurations resulting
in a change in top platform orientation (7-14 in Table I),
angular displacement was measured graphically as shown
in Figure 6, and the maximum angular difference between
model prediction and experiment was 3.14 degrees.
We observed a small amount of ﬂex in the top acrylic plate
during the experiments. This unmodeled effect is a source
of error between model prediction and actual manipulator
shape. Future designs should mitigate this inaccuracy by de-
signing the top plate thickness to better handle the expected

Fig. 7. Displacements of the top platform centroid in the x, y, and z
directions are plotted by using our forward kinematics model to perform
quasistatic simulation with an incrementally increasing vertical load for
three different manipulator conﬁgurations (1, 4, and 5 in Table I) . The black
dashed lines depict the experimentally determined critical buckling loads for
the same cases. (a) The simulation converged to a buckled solution at an
applied load very close to the experimentally determined buckling load.

reaction moments which can be determined using the model.
A. Buckling Experiments
We also experimentally determined a critical buckling
load for the prototype structure in three different actuator
conﬁgurations, (1, 4, and 5 in Table I, corresponding to a
straight neutral case and two translating cases, respectively).
We applied an incrementally increasing force in the negative
z direction (down) through the centroid of the top plate
until at least one leg in the structure began to buckle. The
resulting experimental buckling loads are shown by the black
dashed lines in Figure 7. When running a forward kinematics
model simulation with the same incrementally increasing
force, our simulation converged to a buckled solution (shown
784
by the sudden large centroid displacement in Figure 7 (a))
at a load close to the experimentally determined buckling
load. For conﬁgurations 4 and 5 ((b) and (c) in Figure
7), the simulation failed to converge to a valid forward
kinematics solution just prior to reaching the experimentally
determined buckling load, indicating that the buckled mode
is not relatively close to the unbuckled state.
VI. CONCLUSIONS
We have provided several new results toward a general un-
derstanding of design and kinematics for parallel continuum
manipulators. The Cosserat-rod modeling approach shows
good agreement with the data from our experiments, and our
kinematic analysis demonstrates the feasibility of achieving
6 DOF dexterity and a large range of motion with a design
similar to a rigid-link Stewart-Gough platform, although
output stiffness can vary widely over the workspace. Future
design work is needed to quantify tradeoffs and scaling laws,
address miniaturization and actuation for endoscopic surgical
applications, and integrate mechatronic control systems. On
the theoretical side, dynamics models are needed, and a
rigorous treatment of buckling is necessary in order to restrict
designs and/or operating regions for safety.
