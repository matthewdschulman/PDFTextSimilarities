AbstractÑWe propose a joint object pose estimation and
categorization approach which extracts information about ob-
ject poses and categories from the object parts and compo-
sitions constructed at different layers of a hierarchical object
representation algorithm, namely Learned Hierarchy of Parts
(LHOP) [7]. In the proposed approach, we Þrst employ the
LHOP to learn hierarchical part libraries which represent
entity parts and compositions across different object categories
and views. Then, we extract statistical and geometric features
from the part realizations of the objects in the images in order
to represent the information about object pose and category
at each different layer of the hierarchy. Unlike the traditional
approaches which consider speciÞc layers of the hierarchies
in order to extract information to perform speciÞc tasks, we
combine the information extracted at different layers to solve a
joint object pose estimation and categorization problem using
distributed optimization algorithms. We examine the proposed
generative-discriminative learningapproachandthealgorithms
on two benchmark 2-D multi-view image datasets. The pro-
posed approach and the algorithms outperform state-of-the-art
classiÞcation, regression and feature extraction algorithms. In
addition, the experimental results shed light on the relationship
between object categorization, pose estimation and the part
realizations observed at different layers of the hierarchy.
I. INTRODUCTION
The Þeld of service robots aims to provide robots with
functionalities which allow them to work in man-made
environments. For instance, the robots should be able to
categorize objects and estimate the pose of the objects to
accomplish various robotics tasks, such as grasping objects
[14]. Representation of object categories enables the robot
to further reÞne the grasping strategy by giving context to
the search for the pose of the object [15].
In this paper, we propose a joint object categorization and
pose estimation approach which extract information about
statistical and geometric properties of object poses and cate-
gories extracted from the object parts and compositions that
are constructed at different layers of the Learned Hierarchy
of Parts (LHOP) [7], [8], [9].
In the proposed approach, we Þrst employ LHOP [7], [8]
to learn hierarchical part libraries which represent object
parts and compositions across different object categories
and views as shown in Fig. 1. Then, we extract statistical

and geometric features from the part realizations of the
objects in the images in order to represent the information
about the object pose and category at each different layer
of the hierarchy. We propose two novel feature extraction
algorithms, namely Histogram of Oriented Parts (HOP) and
Entropy of Part Graphs. HOP features measure local distri-
butions of global orientations of part realizations of objects
at different layers of a hierarchy.On the other hand, Entropy
of Part Graphs provides information about the statistical and
geometric structure of object representations by measuring
the entropy of the relative orientations of parts. In addition,
we compute a Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) [5]
of part realizations in order to obtain information about the
co-occurrence of the gradients of part orientations.
Unlike traditional approaches which extract information
from the object representations at speciÞc layers of the
hierarchy to accomplish speciÞc tasks, we combine the
information extracted at different layers to solve a joint
object pose estimation and categorization problem using a
distributed optimization algorithm. For this purpose, we Þrst
formulate the joint object pose estimation and categorization
problem as a sparse optimization problem called Group
Lasso [19]. We consider the pose estimation problem as
a sparse regression problem and the object categorization
problem as a multi-class logistic regression problem using
Group Lasso. Then, we solve the optimization problems
using a distributed and paralleloptimization algorithm called
the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM)
[1].
In this work, we extract information on object poses and
categories from 2-D images to handle the cases where 3-

D sensing may not be available or may be unreliable (e.g.
glass, metal objects). We examine the proposed approach
and the algorithms on two benchmark 2-D multiple-view
image datasets. The proposed approach and the algorithms
outperform state-of-the-art Support Vector Machine and Re-
gression algorithms. In addition, the experimental results
shed light on the relationship between object categorization,
poseestimationandthepartrealizationsobservedatdifferent
layers of the hierarchy.
In the next section, related work is reviewed and the
novelty of our proposed approach is summarized. In Section
II, a brief presentation of the hierarchical compositional
representation is given. Feature extraction algorithms are
introduced in Section III. The joint object pose estimation
and categorization problem is deÞned, and two algorithms
are proposed to solve the optimization problem in Section
IV. Experimental analyses are given in Section V. Section
VI concludes the paper.
A. Related Work and Contribution
In the Þeld of computer vision the problem of object
categorization and pose estimation is studied thoroughly and
some of the approaches are proliferating to the robotics
community. With an advent of devices based on PrimeSense
sensors, uni-modal 3-D or multi-modal integration of 2-D
and 3-D data (e.g. rgb-d data) have been widely used by
robotics researchers [13]. However, 3-D sensing may not be
available or reliable due to limitations of object structures,
lighting resources and imaging conditions in many cases
where single or multiple view 2-D images are used for
categorization and pose estimation [3], [4], [20]. In [20],
a probabilistic approach is proposed to estimate the pose of
a known object using a single image. Collet et al. [3] build
3D models of objects using SIFT features extracted from 2D
images for robotic manipulation, and combine single image
and multiple image object recognition and pose estimation
algorithms in a framework in [4].
A promising approach to the object categorization and the
scene description is the use of hierarchical compositional ar-
chitectures [7], [9], [15]. Compositional hierarchical models
are constructed for object categorization and detection using
single images in [7], [9]. Multiple view images are used
for pose estimation and categorization using a hierarchical
architecture in [15]. In the aforementioned approaches, the
tasks are performed using either discriminative or generative
top-down or bottom-up learning approaches in architectures.
For instance, Lai et al. employ a top-down categorization
and pose estimation approach in [15], where a different
task is performed at each different layer of the hierarchy.
Note that, a categorization error occurring at the top-layer
of the hierarchy may propagate to the lower layer and affect
the performance of other tasks such as pose estimation in
this approach. In our proposed approach, we Þrst construct
generative representations of object shapes using LHOP [7],
[8], [9]. Then, we train discriminative models by extracting
features from the object representations. In addition, we
propose a new method, which enables us to combine the
informationextracted at each differentlayer of the hierarchy,
for joint categorization and pose estimation of objects. We
avoid the propagation of errors of performing multiple tasks
throughthelayers and enabletheshareability of parts among
layers by the employmentof optimization algorithmsin each
layer in a parallel and distributed learning framework.
The novelty of the proposed approach and the paper can
be summarized as follows;
1) In this work, the Learned Hierarchy of Parts (LHOP)
is employedin order to learn a hierarchyof parts using
the shareability of parts across different views as well
as different categories [7], [8].
2) Two novel feature extraction algorithms, namely His-
togram of Oriented Parts (HOP) and Entropy of Part
Graphs, are proposed in order to obtain information
about the statistical and geometric structure of objectsÕ
shapes represented at different layers of the hierarchy
using part realizations.
3) The proposed generative-discriminative approach en-
ables us to combine the information extracted at dif-
ferent layers in order to solve a joint object pose esti-
mation and categorization problem using a distributed
and parallel optimization algorithm. Therefore, this
approach also enables us to share the parts among
different layers and avoid the propagation of object
categorization and pose estimation errors through the
layers.
II. LEARNED HIERARCHY OF PARTS
In this section, Learned Hierarchy of Parts (LHOP)[7], [8]
is brießy described. In LHOP, the object recognition process
is performed in a hierarchy starting from a feature layer
through more complex and abstract interpretations of object
shapes to an objectlayer. A learned vocabularyis a recursive
compositional representation of shape parts. Unsupervised
bottom-up statistical learning is encompassed in order to
obtain such a description.
Shape representations are build upon a set of composi-
tional parts which at the lowest layer use atomic features,
e.g. Gabor features, extracted from image data. The object
node is a composition of several child nodes located at one
layer lower in the hierarchy, and the composition rule is
recursively applied to each of its child nodes to the lowest
layer ?
1
. All layers together form a hierarchically encoded
vocabulary ?=?
1
??
2
?...??
L
. The entire vocabulary ?
is learned from the training set of images together with the
vocabulary parameters [8].
The parts in the hierarchy are deÞned recursively in the
following way. Each part in the l
th
layer represents the
spatial relations between its constituent subparts from the
layer below. Each composite part P
l
k
constructed at the l
th
layer is characterized by a central subpart P
l?1
central
and a
list of remaining subparts with their positions relative to the
center as

where ?

j
) denotes the relative position of the
subpart P
l?1
j
, while ?
j
denotes the allowed variance of its
position around (x
j
,y
j
).
III. FEATURE EXTRACTION FROM LEARNED PARTS
LHOP provides information about different properties of
objects, such as poses, orientations and category member-
ships, at different layers [7]. For instance, the information
on shape parts, which are represented by edge structures and
texturalpatternsobservedin images,is obtainedusing Gabor
features at the Þrst layer L
1
. In the second and the following
layers, compositions of parts are constructed according to
the co-occurrence of part realizations that are detected in
the images among different views of the objects and across
differentobject categories.In other words, a library of object
parts and compositions is learned jointly for all object views
and categories.
In order to obtain information about statistical and geo-
metric properties of parts, we extract three types of features
from the part realizations detected at each different layer of
the LHOP.
A. Histogram of Orientations of Parts
Histograms of orientations of parts are computed in order
to extractinformationon theco-occurrenceof orientationsof
the parts across different poses of objects. Part orientations
are computed according to a coordinate system of an image
I whose origin is located at the center of the image I, and
the axes of the coordinate system are shown with blue lines
in Figure 2.

the origin of the coordinate system is computed as

Then, the image I is partitioned into M cells {I

B. Histogram of Oriented Gradients of Parts
In addition to the computation of histograms of ori-
entations of part realizations p
l
k
,?k = 1,2,...,K,?l =
1,2,...,L, we compute histogram of oriented gradients
(HOG) [5] of p
l
k
in order to extract information about the
distribution of gradient orientations of p

C. The Entropy of Part Graphs
We measure the statistical and structural properties of
relative orientations of part realizations by measuring the
complexity of a graph of parts. Mathematically speaking,
we deÞne a weighted undirected graph G
l
?=(E

weights are computed according to the orientations of parts
relative to each other.

IV. COMBINATION OF INFORMATION OBTAINED AT
DIFFERENT LAYERS OF LHOP FOR JOINT OBJECT POSE
ESTIMATION AND CATEGORIZATION
In hierarchical compositional architectures, a different
object property, such as object shape, pose and category, is
representedat a differentlayer of a hierarchyin a vocabulary
[15]. According the structures of the abstract representations
of the properties, i.e. vocabularies, recognition processes
havebeen performedusingeither abottom-up[7],[8] ortop-
down [15] approach. ItÕs worth noting that the information
in the representations are distributed among the layers in
the vocabularies. In other words, the information about the
category of an object may reside at the lower layers of
the hierarchy instead of the top layer. In addition, lower
layer atomic features, e.g. oriented Gabor features, provide
information about part orientations which can be used for
the estimation of pose and view-points of objects at the
higher layers. Moreover, the relationship between the pose
and category of an object is bi-directional. Therefore, an
information integration approach should be considered in
order to avoid the propagation of errors that occur in multi-
task learning and recognition problems such as joint object
categorizationand poseestimation,especially when onlyone
of the bottom-up and top-down approaches is implemented.
For this purpose, we propose a generative-discriminative
learning approach in order to combine the information ob-
tained at each different layer of LHOP using the features
extracted from part realizations. We represent the features
deÞning a D
p

l

(f

training and test image, therefore we denote the feature
vector of the i

as f

, ?i = 1,2,...,N, in the
rest of the paper.
We combine the feature vectors extracted at each l

V. EXPERIMENTS
We examine our proposed approach and algorithms on
two benchmark object categorization and pose estimation
datasets, which are namely the Amsterdam Libraryof Object
Images(ALOI) [10] and the ColumbiaObject ImageLibrary
(COIL-100) [17]. We have chosen these two benchmark
datasets for two main reasons. First, images of objects are
captured by rotating the objects on a turntable by regular
orientation degrees which enable us to analyze our proposed
algorithm for multi-view object pose estimation and cate-
gorization in uncluttered scenes. Second, object poses and
categories are labeled within acceptable precision which is
important to satisfy the statistical stability of training and
test samples and their target values. In our experiments, we
also re-calibrated labels of pose and rotation values of the
objects that are mis-recorded in the datasets.
We select the bin size (bSize) of the histograms and
cell size M of HOP (see Section III-A) and HOG features
(see Section III-B) by greedy search on the parameter
set {8,16,32,64}, and take the optimal

and categorizationas suggested in [1]. In the implementation
of LHOP, we learn the compositional hierarchy of parts and
compute the part realizations for L=1,2,3,4 [7].
In the experiments, pose estimation and categorization
performances of the proposed algorithms are compared with
state-of-the-art Support Vector Regression (SVR), Support
Vector Machines (SVM) [2], Lasso and Logistic regression
algorithms [12] which use the state-of-the-art HOG features
[5] extracted from the images as considered in [11]. In
the results, we refer to an implementation of SVM with
HOGfeaturesas SVM-HOG,SVMwith theproposedLHOP
features as SVM-LHOP, SVR with HOG features as SVR-

Lasso with HOG features as L-HOG, Logistic Regression
with HOG features as LR-HOG, Lasso with LHOP features
as L-LHOP, Logistic Regression with LHOP features as LR-
LHOP.
We use RBF kernels in SVR and SVM. The kernel width
parameter ? is searched in the interval log(?) ? [?10,5]
and the SVR cost penalization parameter ? is searched in
the interval log(?)? [?10,5] using the training datasets.
A. Experiments on Object Pose Estimation
We have conducted two types of experiments for object
poseestimation,namelyObject-wiseandCategory-wisePose
Estimation. We analyze the sharability of the parts across
different views of an object in Object-wise Pose Estimation
experiments.In Category-wise Pose Estimation experiments,
weanalyzeincorporationofcategoryinformationtosharabil-
ity of partsin theLHOP andto poseestimation performance.
1) Experiments on Object-wise Pose Estimation: In the
Þrst set of experiments,we consider the objects belongingto
each different category, individually. For instance, we select
?
o
tr
= 4 objects for training and ?
o

using objects belonging to cups category. The ID numbers
of the objects and their category names are given in Table I.
For each object, we have 72 object instances each of which
represents an orientation of the object z

addition, we observe that the difference between f

as l increases. In other words, the discriminative power of
the generative model of the LHOP increases at the higher
layers of the LHOP since the LHOP captures the important
parts and compositions that are co-occurred across different
views through different layers.

Pose estimation errors of state-of-the-art algorithms and the
proposed Hierarchical Compositional Approach are given in
Figure4.Intheseresults,weobservethattheposeestimation
errors of the algorithms which are implemented using the
symmetric objects, such as apples and balls, are greater
than that of the algorithms that are implemented on more
structural objects such as cups.
In order to analyze this observation in detail, we show the
ground truth ? and the estimated orientations
ö
? of some of
the objects from Apples, Balls, cups and Shoes categories in
Figure 5. We observe that some of the different views of the
same object have the same shape and textural properties.For
instance, the views of the ball at the orientations ? = 10
?
and ?=225
?
represent the same pentagonal shape patterns.
Therefore, similar parts are detected at these different views
and the similar features are extracted from these detected
parts. Then, the orientation of the ball, which is rotated by
?=10
?
, is incorrectly estimated as

?=225

2) Experiments on Category-wise Pose Estimation: In
Category-wise Pose Estimation experiments, we select dif-
ferent ?

number of objects from different C number of
categories as training images to estimate the pose of test
objects,randomly.WeemploytheexperimentsonbothALOI
and COIL datasets.
In the ALOI dataset, we randomly select ?
o
tr
= 1,2,3,4
number of training objects and ?
o
te
= 1 test object which
belong to Cups, Cow, Car, Clock and Duck categories. We
repeat the random selection process two times and give the
average pose estimation error for each experiment. In order
to analyze the contribution of the information that can be
obtained from the parts to the pose estimation performance
using the part sharability of the LHOP, we initially select
Cups and Cow categories (C = 2) and add new categories
(Car, Clock and Duck) to the dataset, incrementally. The
results are given in Table II. The results show that the
pose estimation error decreases as the number of training
samples, ?
o
tr
, increases. This is due to the fact that the
addition of new objects to the dataset increases the statistical
representation capacity of the LHOP and the learning model
of the regression algorithm. In addition, we observe that the
pose estimation error observed in the experiments for C =2
decreases when the objects from Car category are added to a
datasetofobjectsbelongingto CupsandCowcategoryin the
experiments with C =3. The performance boost is achieved
by increasing the shareability of co-occurred object parts in
different categories. For instance, the parts that construct the
rectangular silhouettes of cows and cars can be shared in
the construction of object representations in the LHOP (see
Figure 6.
We employed two types of experiments on COIL dataset,
constructing balanced and unbalanced training and test sets,

in order to analyze the effect of the unbalanced data to the
pose estimation performance.In the experiments,the objects
are selected from Cat, Spatula, Cups and Car categories
which contain 3, 3, 10 and 10 objects. Each object is rotated
on a turntable by 5
?
from 0
?
to 355
?
.
In the experiments on balanced datasets, images of ?

number of objects are initially selected from Cat and Spatula
categories (for C = 2), and then images of the objects se-
lected fromCups and Car categoriesare incrementallyadded
to the dataset for C = 3 and C = 4 category experiments.
More speciÞcally, ?

objects are randomly selected from
each categoryandtherandomselectionis repeatedtwo times
for each experiment. The results are shown in Table III.
We observe that the addition of new objects to the datasets
decreases the pose estimation error. Moreover, we observe
a remarkable performance boost when the images of the
objectsfromthecategoriesthathavesimilar silhouettes,such
as Cat and Cups or Spatula and Car, are used in the same
dataset.

We prepared unbalanced datasets by randomly selecting
the images of ?

= 1 object from each category as a test
sample and the images of the rest of the objects belonging
to the associated category in the COIL dataset as training
samples. For instance, the images of a randomly selected cat
are selected as test samples and the images of the remaining
two cats are selected as training samples. This procedure
is repeated two times in each experiment and the average
values of pose estimation errors are depicted in Figure 7.
The results show that SVR is more sensitive to the balance
of the dataset and the number of training samples than the
proposed approach. For instance, the difference between the
pose estimation error of SVR given in Table III and Figure
7 for C =4 is approximately 10
?
, while that of the proposed
Hierarchical Compositional Approach is approximately 5

categories increases in the previous sections. The reason of
the observation of this error difference is that the objects
rotated on a turn table may provide similar silhouettes
although they may belong to different categories. Therefore,
additionof the imagesof new objectsthat belongto different
categories may boost pose estimation performance. On the
other hand, addition of the images of these new objects
may decrease the categorization performance if the parts of
the object cannot be shared across different categories and
increase the data complexity of the feature space.
VI. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we have proposed a compositional hierar-
chical approach for joint object pose estimation and catego-
rization using a generative-discriminative learning method.
The proposed approach Þrst exposes information about pose
and category of an object by extracting features from its
realizations observed at different layers of LHOP in order
to consider different levels of abstraction of information
represented in the hierarchy. Next, we formulate joint object
pose estimation and categorization problem as a sparse opti-
mization problem. Then, we solve the optimization problem
by integrating the features extracted at each different layer
using a distributed and parallel optimization algorithm.
We examine the proposed approach on benchmark 2-D
multi-view image datasets. In the experiments, the proposed
approach outperforms state-of-the-art Support Vector Ma-
chines for object categorization and Support Vector Regres-
sion algorithmforobjectposeestimation.Inaddition,weob-
serve that shareability of object parts across different object
categories and views may increase pose estimation perfor-
mance.On the other hand,objectcategorizationperformance
may decrease as the number of categories increases if parts
of an object cannot be shared across different categories,
and increase the data complexity of the feature space. The
proposed approach can successfully estimate the pose of
objects which have view-speciÞc statistical and geometric
properties. On the other hand, the proposed feature extrac-
tion algorithms cannot provide information about the view-
speciÞc properties of symmetric or semi-symmetric objects,
which leads to a decrease of the object pose estimation and
categorization performance. Therefore, the ongoing work is
directed towards alleviating the problems with symmetric or
semi-symmetric objects.
