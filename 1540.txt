Abstract—In electronic manufacturing system, the design of
the robotic hand with sufﬁcient dexterity and conﬁguration is
important for the successful accomplishment of the assembly
task.Duetothegrowingdemandfromhigh-mixmanufacturing
industry, it is difﬁcult for the traditional robot to grasp a large
number of assembly parts or tools having cylinder shapes with
correct postures. In this research, a novel jaw like gripper with
human-sized anthropomorphic features is designed for in-hand
precise positioning and twisting online. It retains the simplicity
feature of traditional industrial grippers and dexterity features
of dexterous grippers. It can apply a constant gripping force on
assembly parts and performs reliable twisting movement within
limited time to meet the industrial requirements. Manipulating
several cylindrical assembly parts by robot, as an experimental
case in this paper, is studied to evaluate its performance.
The effectiveness of proposed gripper design and mechanical
analysis is proved by the simulation and experimental results.
I. INTRODUCTION
During the past tens of year, the development in manu-
facturing industry has been divided into three main streams:
Massive Production, Medium Production and Small produc-
tion. Small production, usually fully using robots, cannot
keep in step with the growing social demanding for High-
Mix, Low-Volume manufacturing. For the manufacturing
fully with human workers, the labor cost is also increasing
rapidly. When addressing this problem, it is important to
build more ﬂexible systems to improve the dexterity and
reconﬁgurability of current manufacturing system by con-
sidering combining and coordinating the above two respects,
considering their trade-off and improving the overall as-
sembly effectiveness and efﬁciency [1]. From our research,
if we can provide the robot with sufﬁcient ﬂexibility in
reconﬁguration, it can help the factory boosting the product
quality and meanwhile reducing the cost [2].
Currently in robotic assembly cell for ﬂexible manufac-
turing, there still remain many unsolved issues for robots.
One is that the robot cannot work efﬁciently in dealing
with assembly parts with complicated shapes. They often
rely on external sensor systems to help with the assembly
work [3]. On the other side, human workers are skilled in
performing complicated tasks using their hands. In this case,
it is essential that the conventional robotic manipulator is

does.Duringthepastyearsofdevelopmentinroboticmanip-
ulators,nevertheless,thebasicappearanceofthemanipulator
has seldom changed, and it is also difﬁcult on the other hand
to modify the basic architecture of robots. Therefore, people
tend to improve the capacity of robots by designing various
functional end-effectors (hands) for robots.
In order to meet industrial application requirements, the
robotic hands must be inexpensive, compact, low weight and
robust.Italsomustbecapableofperformingsimplegrasping
and manipulation tasks, such as precision manipulation, in-
hand grasp transitions, and sufﬁciently general to manipulate
different objects and tools. Up to present, most robotic
hands in both industrial and academic worlds are either few
actuators powered jaws, or simpliﬁed human hand shape
liked multi-ﬁngered hands for certain grasping patterns. Lots
of researchers have already paid much attention to develop
such functional robotic end-effectors in the past 25 years. A
robotic gripper could be of two ﬁngers, like a jaw [3] with
two ﬁngers in our previous research, three ﬁngers [5] or four
ﬁngers [6] or even more, the same with human’s hand [7].
Parallel manipulator [8] has been already successfully
implemented in industry. They can perform and demonstrate
pick and place operations in really fast speed with high
reliability [9]. Meanwhile, it is much cheaper and simpler
than serial manipulators. It is widely adopted in high speed,
high-accuracy positioning within only limited workspace,
such as food packing and electronic parts placing.
Another novel universal grippers is developed, which
is able to pick up unfamiliar objects of widely varying

shape and surface properties [10]. Different with traditional
grippers, the individual ﬁngers are replaced by a single mass
of granular material that, when pressed onto a target object,
ﬂows around it and conforms to its shape. Upon application
of a vacuum the granular material contracts and hardens
quickly to pinch and hold the object without requiring senso-
ry feedback. However, neither parallel manipulator nor this
universal hand is able to do in-hand dexterous manipulation.
When addressing the dexterous robotic hands, DLR hand
[11], Barrett hand [12] and i-HY hand [13], which are all
human-sized anthropomorphic robotic hand, are the most
representative. Both DLR hand and Barrett hand have the
dexterity to secure target objects of different sizes, shapes,
and orientations. Furthermore, i-HY is specially designed
for passive adaptive grasp. It has also demonstrated a good
ability in in-hand object transition, such as pinch grasp to
power grasp gesture transition.
Although various grippers are designed and built for
precise picking and placing, seldom attention has been paid
to the in-hand transition problem for potential industrial
application, particularly in lots of assembly case within elec-
tronic manufacturing industry. In such industry, the assembly
parts are usually well shaped rigid ones, and therefore, the
parallel jaw like gripper is widely adopted. However, there
still remains a large number of assembly parts or tools which
are cylinder shaped made by either rigid or soft materials
[14](Fig. 2). If these parts are not ﬁxed to some positions
as people in industry always do, but are just naturally lying
on the conveyor (Fig. 2-(e)), there could be lots of possible
postures available for the robot to choose before they are
successfully grasped. Usually in such situation, the robotic
manipulator has to carefully examine them by utilizing
sensor system, and choose an appropriate gesture to pick it
up. This method is straight but not effective. It has increased
the complexity of the whole system. It also costs the robot
lotsoftimetosearchanddecidepropergesture.Ifthegripper
picks up it and adjusts its posture in-hand, it will save a
huge amount of time. As a consequence, it is essential to
design a jaw like gripper combining the advantages of both
conventional industrial gripper and dexterous robotic hands,
which can not only be used for general picking and placing
usage, but also for in-hand transition. It also needs to be able
to work under very extreme working conditions, including
high velocity and acceleration, little time consumption but
high accuracy requirements, and so on.
The main contribution of this research is that we de-
velop a novel jaw gripper with human-sized anthropomor-
phic features especially suitable for precise in-hand posture
transitions, such as twisting and re-positioning (TP). The
advantagesofthisgrippers,comparedwithtraditionalrobotic
gripper, is that it can apply a constant gripping force on
cylinder shaped assembly parts with various surface material
(Table I) and can perform positioning and twisting with
relatively high speed. Therefore, it can guarantee a trade-
off between the effectiveness of parallel manipulator and
dexterity of human-sized anthropomorphic robotic hands. It

This paper is organized as follows. In Section II, after a
brief introduction of the design requirements and assump-
tions, mechanical design of TP gripper is discussed. In Sec-
tion III, the mechanical behavior study is carried out. Also
an initial task analysis is presented. In Section IV, we carry
out the simulation according to the mechanical analysis,
and test the gripper under practical industrial environment.
Conclusions and future works are presented in Section V.
II. MECHANICAL DESIGN
A. Problems, Requirements and Assumptions
Small production has to keep step with the growing social
demandingforHigh-Mix,Low-Volumemanufacturing,ithas
to adopt various robotic manipulators with different end-
effectors to carry out different assembly tasks. A typical
small production shown in Fig. 1 can be divided into
three parts: 1) Feeding system. It is usually constructed by
conveyors. 2) Robotic manipulators. The key point for this
part is to design various functional end-effectors, or grippers.
3) The assembly zone. The basic assembly action is: picking,
ﬁxing, placing, mating, and so on.
The basic assumption in this research is that the general
shape of the assembly parts is cylinder, and with different
surface materials. Usually when this kind of assembly parts
lie on the conveyor, there could be several possible postures
(Fig. 2-(e)). However, due to the design of the assembly
system (Fig. 1), only limited number of postures are ﬁtting
for correctly assembly. If the posture is already ﬁt enough,
what leaves for the gripper is just to grasp it and perform the
predesigned assembly action. If the posture is not ﬁt, there
remainssomepossiblesolutions:1)changethepostureofthe
assembly parts before they are grasped by the manipulator,
or 2) adjust the posture of the assembly parts after they
are grasped. There are a lot of related researches about
how to estimate the postures of the assembly parts related

Motor Function
DC Motor 1 Control the stable contact on assembly parts
between two inner grippers
DC Motor 2 Control the distance between two outer ﬁngers
Linear DC Motor Control the twisting movement in vertical direction
using the inner ﬁngers
with the ﬁrst solution by using some speciﬁc sensor systems
and estimation algorithms, and then robotic manipulator
grasp them from appropriate direction. There are also special
machines designed to support adjusting the posture of the
assembly parts with external force, like using vibration. Due
to some technical difﬁculties, seldom of these researches
have ever considered adjusting the posture of the gripper
online using the second solution. The second solution is very
adaptive and reliable, and it can cope with more situations
than the ﬁrst solution.
Inspired by human being’s hands (Fig. 3-(b)), it is better
the traditional parallel jaw like gripper which can do the
twist action by sliding one ﬁngertip on the surface of another
ﬁnger. A twisting action refers to the action grasp of an
object in a human hand, which adjust its posture by twisting
the ﬁngers. It is easier to do so if a complete human-sized
anthropomorphic robotic hand is built. It is difﬁcult to apply
this technology on hand shape like robotic hands, but it is
relatively easier to make a jaw shape like robotic gripper to
do so but only if it is equipped with additional movement
freedom.Therefore,Itisimportanttodesignaroboticgripper
not only reserve the simplicity of jaw like gripper but also
keep some feature like dexterous manipulation. One key
issue in designing such a gripper is how to guarantee a
constant and reliable twisting movement by the two ﬁngers
without dropping the gripped assembly parts.
B. TP Gripper Mechanical Design
In this paper, we design a robotic gripper for positioning
and twisting to meet some industrial assembly requirements.
The architecture of this TP gripper is shown in Fig. 3. A
typical TP gripper (just half shown in Fig. 3-(a)) is driven by
four motors (two DC motors and two linear DC motors). The
functions of these motors are shown in Table II. Compare
with the conventional gripper, this 4-DOF TP gripper can not
only do open and close for positioning, but also do twisting
for effective assemble cylindrical parts (Fig. 3-(d))).
A TP gripper also includes inner ﬁngers and outer ﬁngers
(Fig. 3-(c))). With the help of DC motor 2, this TP gripper is
suitable for almost every diameter of the cylindrical shaped
electronic assembly parts by adjusting the distance between

line). The center of the motor can be considered coincident. The arrows

its outer ﬁngers. The inner ﬁngers, driven by the linear mo-
tors, can slide on the track inside the outer ﬁngers. DC motor
1 can adjust the contact point upon the object and guarantee
a constant gripping force applied on the assembly parts.
It provides sufﬁcient friction force with which the cylinder
assembly parts can be twisted by two inner gripper ﬁngers.
Both of the linear motors drive the inner ﬁnger movement
with independent velocity. In this case, the rotation angle can
be precisely controlled by both inner and outer ﬁngers.
III. KINEMATICS ANALYSIS
In order to control the position of the object precisely, it is
necessary to know the precise ﬁngertip position. As shown
in Fig. 4, the ﬁnger structure is the composition of two four-
bar-linkages. The analytical solution is to ﬁnd out the point
position D

C. Task Analysis
It is assumed that the robot can always grasp the object at
orclosetothecentreofgravity,sowedonothavetoconsider
the misalignment of the object along y-axis. A typical grasp
with in-hand transition process is divided into four phase
(Fig. 5-(b)): (1) approaching, (2) grasping, (3) picking up,
and (4) twisting with an angle theta or repositioning with
a desired distance. During the second phase (b?2), how in
deep (d) the gripper can grasp the object will determine how
the gripper will do the twisting. If d is very large, most of
the twisting case will take place upon the inner ﬁngers. If d
is very small, which means the TP gripper only grasps the
object close to the end of the ﬁngertip (b?3). In this case,
if a large rotational angle ? is required, the TP gripper has
to twist the objects upon the outer ﬁnger (b?4).
D. Twisting Dynamic
For simplicity, it is also assumed that the cross section of
the gripped object is a perfect circle with a radius of R. So
during the twisting phase, the dynamic analysis is shown in
Fig. 5-(a). According to Newton law, we have

During the assembly process, the object has to suffer from
high acceleration via the horizonal direction. It also equals
to the robotic end-effector movement acceleration. Because

B. Gripper test for twisting and repositioning
The generic application on different objects are carried out
in Fig. 7. The twisting on inner ﬁngers and outer ﬁngers as
described in Section III-C is also studied. One may notice
that there is an alignment displacement on the two ﬁngers
after twisting, which may prevent the gripper from moving
down towards the assembly area. The solutions are mainly
two, 1) drop the assembly parts to the assembly slots when
the gripper is getting close enough, or 2) adjust the posture
of the robot gripper, and make one part of the assembly part
touch the slot. The assembly part will slide into the slot due
to its compliance structure when it is released.
C. Gripper test for high speed assembly
We also test the gripper performance within high ac-
celeration and high speed movement by attaching it to an
industrial robotic manipulator. Fig. 8 shows the basic three
phases within a complete twisting movement. According to
the experimental results (table III), it costs less than 0.6s
to accomplish twisting by rotating within 180 degrees. The
