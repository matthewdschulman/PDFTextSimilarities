Resonance-driven dynamic manipulation: dribbling and juggling with
elastic beam.
Alexander Pekarovskiy, Kunal Saluja, Rohan Sarkar and Martin Buss
AbstractÑ This paper presents a new device and a method
for dynamic manipulation. The device consists of a planar
robotic arm and an elastic beam as an end-effector. Using it
the elastic end-effector will tend to increase performance and
energy efÞciency while executing dynamic and repetitive tasks.
Through the control of the beam vibration and resonant modes,
we modify the state of manipulated objects. For lightweight
objects the control is provided through the intermittent contacts
without changing dynamics of the beam. However, we show that
by using proper synchronization technique continuous-phase
contacts are also possible. Juggling and dribbling of a ball are
considered to be an alternating non-prehensile catching and
throwing task. Such alternating decelerating and accelerating
impacts on the ball and the curvature of the beam at the time
of impact will stabilize the cyclic orbit of the ball. By proper
analysis of continuous-time contact and dynamics of the beam
we establish a rhythmic movement of the system. With the
variation of frequency and amplitude of the beam it is possible
to switch between different dynamic actions such as juggling,
dribbling, throwing, catching and balancing.
I. INTRODUCTION
Most of the robotic tasks are related to maximizing the
rigidity of an end-effector to increase the performance of the
robot. To increase the throughput of the manipulation tasks
it is common to damp the vibration of the ßexible structures
to a reasonable level.
We are chasing the same goal, but by introduction of
elasticity in the end-effector. At the same time we aim to
get speciÞed repeatability and accuracy in handling an object,
especially for periodic manipulation tasks like dribbling and
juggling. With such an end-effector, the vibration at high
speeds is not being damped but is rather being controlled to
obtain the prescribed properties for steady state. It is desir-
able to handle the widest possible range of objects with the
robot end-effector. This minimizes changeover requirements,
reduces costs for multiple tools and addresses weight and size
considerations. Besides, the intrinsic elasticity increases the
performance and energy efÞciency while performing such
dynamic and repetitive tasks.
In manufacturing processes there are various manipulative
tasks with deformable linear objects (DLOs). Multiple works
reported the results on manipulation of DLOs and the sub-
sequent usage of sensory systems to reach a particular goal.

Khalil [1] presented the usage of intelligent multi-sensory
systems that combine vision data with force and tactile mea-
surements to achieve proper interaction between the robotic
manipulator and the deformable object. Yue and Henrich [2]
carried out a research on the vibration of deformable objects
and the task of inserting them in a hole by fast manipulation
with a 6 DOF force/torque sensor mounted at the wrist of
the robot arm.
Walking, running and jumping are some of the various
rhythmic tasks performed by humans in their daily lives.
These are of great importance in robotics, which aim to
emulate such a periodic behavior. The knowledge of various
dribbling or juggling models provide a theoretical basis for
many complex tasks. Juggling is a rhythmic yet conÞned op-
eration which involves sensomotoric coordination and several
phase-locking relationships between the juggled object and
the end-effector.
In robotics juggling has been attributed to be a challenging
and dexterous task and was a benchmark tool for the Þeld
of dynamic manipulation for many years. The Þrst juggling
robot in print was presented in the work of Aboaf et al. [3],
where they discussed learning algorithm for juggling. Rizzi
and Koditchek [4] implemented a stable system for ping-
pong ball juggling using stereo vision and 3 DOF robot.
Schaal and Atkeson [5] investigated an open-loop control
applied to different dynamical manipulation tasks. Buehler et
al. [6], [7] analyzed the class of repeating robot-environment
interactions, including discontinuities caused by the impact.
They introduced a feedback law called the mirror algorithm
that deÞnes the trajectory of the paddle as it is mirrored about
the desired impact height and also a scaled version of the
ball trajectory. Consequently, this requires constant tracking
of the ball position. They showed that the apex height of the
ball is stabilized. Interestingly, the resulting paddle trajectory
is controlled by accelerating at impact, which contrasts the
result of Schaal and Atkeson [5] who analyzed the stabilizing
property of a decelerating paddle for an open-loop bouncing
ball system.
A number of papers dealt with the spatial elastic dribbling.
For example, Baetz and Mettin et al. [8], [9] discussed
continuous-time control of the task. Haddadin et al. [10]
investigated potential energy storage of the elastic plate using
passive compliance of the hand to facilitate blind dribbling
task. Reist and DÕAndrea [11] designed a juggling robot
that is able to vertically bounce a completely unconstrained
ball without any sensing in all the 3 dimensions. They took
the impact time measurements as feedback and proved that
the closed-loop performance is only marginally improved

as compared to open-loop control. An aluminum paddle of
a particular Þxed curvature was decelerated at the time of
impact to stabilize the impact. Haddadin et al. [10] also con-
sidered only the bending of the elastic material. Modeling of
elastic structures was done by Barnoski [12] who discussed
the response of elastic beam to the base excitation.
However, most of the work done on juggling and dribbling
is using a rigid paddle but no work has been done as to how
a continuously changing curvature of the elastic material can
affect the stability. The use of resonant modes of an elastic
material would be an entirely new approach in this direction.
Various dynamic tasks use different end-effector design in
each case suited to the particular task to be achieved. By
exciting the elastic beam, see Fig. 1, with proper amplitudes
and frequency, we can use the same end-effector to perform
a variety of dynamic tasks like dribbling, balancing, batting,
juggling and catching.
Fig. 1: End-effector as an elastic beam.
The paper is organized as follows: In Section II the
modeling of the elastic beam as an end-effector, the beam
and part dynamics, the resonance conditions and the collision
model are described. In Section III motion planning and
control of the beam are investigated. In Section IV the
simulation veriÞcation of hybrid dynamics task is provided.
Finally, in Section V our results are concluded and future
work is discussed.
II. MODELING
Several assumptions are assumed for proper modeling:
A1 The object is modeled as a rigid ball.
A2 There is no air-friction.
A3 The end-effector is modeled as a uniform elastic beam.
A4 The collision is elastic with coefÞcient of restitution c
r
.
A5 The damping in the beam is omitted.
The presented end-effector broadens the dynamic capabil-
ity of the periodic manipulation tasks. The main advantages
are energy storage due to elastic nature of the beam and
large contact area for manipulation of multiple objects.
Intermittent and continuous-time juggling is possible by
proper control of relative velocities, curvature and contact
properties between the object and the beam. Since the beam
is represented as a long thin stick, it can be modeled as a
cantilever beam. To excite different modes of vibration the
beam is clamped from one side and free from another, hence
the beam undergoes free vibrations.
A. Model of the elastic beam as an end-effector
The slender beam has a high length to breadth ratio. The
shear deformation and rotary inertia effects are neglected
based on the Euler-Bernoulli beam assumptions. The Euler-
Bernoulli beam is subjected to the translationy(t) of its base
in the transverse direction. Deformations of the geometrically
uniform thin beam are assumed to be small.

Equation (11) describes the complete behavior of the beam
at every point in time. It is a convergent sequence that tends
to a particular solution.
D. Vibration modes conditions
Different excitation frequencies and amplitudes of the
robot tip point result in various standing waves. Four differ-
ent modes of vibration are presented in Fig. 3. The described

modes are achieved only with the excitation of resonant
frequencies.
E. Part dynamics
Collisions between the objects are assumed to be partially
elastic such that the time period between successive colli-
sions is sufÞcient for the beam to regain its vibration mode.
The mass of the object is considered to be negligible to cause
any disturbance to the current mode of beam vibration.

III. CONTROL DESIGN AND MOTION PLANNING
Through the continuous sinusoidal excitation of the beam
it becomes possible to generate modes of vibration. The idea
for this object manipulation is to fulÞll some periodic goal.
The classical goal for the vertical juggling is to support
constant maximum height of the ball. Or to keep stable
dribling for some predeÞned end-effector height above the
ßoor. In control terms it means that the limit cycle of the task
has to converge to some equilibrium point. Since the object
gets in contact with the beam, the system transforms to a
hybrid one with transient conditions. In this paper we limit
ourselves only to discussion about juggling and dribbling in
the vicinity of the beam antinodes.
A. Ball trajectory determination for juggling
Juggling task requires initialization procedure to obtain the
ball trajectory. Position and velocity data can be obtained
directly using tracking system.
The data needed can be also indirectly achieved with a
force/torque measurements. The ball is released from some
height h and longitudinal distance from the base r. The
robot holds the beam in a horizontal plane without any
vibration at any instant of time. For this measurement we
make an assumption that the beam is rigid. Afterwards we
read measurements from the two consecutive collisions

B. Motion planning for periodic reference trajectory
To be able to control the periodic contact we have to
synchronize vibration of the beam with the period of the
ball. The conditions for synchronization are as follows

Fig. 6: Five possible cases of ball-beam contact in the antinodes, solid for
juggling and dashed for dribbling. First, antinode is higher than the base
line and decelerating, Second, higher than the base line and accelerating,
Third, lower than the base line and decelerating, Fourth, higher than the
base line and accelerating, and Þnally that it is exactly at the base line
and acceleration is zero. All contacts for dribbling are symmetrical to the
juggling.
946
For our elastic beam manipulation we would like to
discuss two intrinsically different juggling scenarios one with
intermittent and another with continuous-time contact, see
Fig 6.
C. Intermittent contact
In this scenario the ball is periodically hitting the beam
in the antinode. There are Þve possible cases. Case one is
marginally stable but practically becomes unstable because
of any disturbance. From [13] it is known that one of the
required conditions for the stable limit cycle is the non-
positive acceleration of the batting point, therefore second
and third cases are leading to instability. The Þfth case is the
vertical collision that happens only when the beam deßection
is zero, i.e. the beam crosses the base line. Collision with
the horizontal line where ¬ y(x,t) = 0 works for all modes
but even in the ideal case we can guarantee only marginal
periodic stability. Finally, case four will be discussed in the
following section.
D. Continuous-time contact
We can show more complex behavior with continuous-
time phase for ¬ y(x,t) < 0, ú y(x,t) < 0. By matching the
velocities at some predeÞned height h
c
, the beam catches
the ball and decelerates till ú y(x,t) = 0. At the minimum
point for juggling and maximum for dribbling the switching
between catching and throwing occurs. The beam carries
the object and releases it exactly at the base line, since
acceleration changes its sign there.
An important feature of such manipulation is that in case
of small perturbations in position or/and velocity the catching
and throwing phases will tend to passively balance the ball to
the antinode due to the beam convexity before the release.
Of course, it is also possible to use these continuous-time
phases for updating and improving feedback control policies,
however it is not within the scope of this paper.
E. Hybrid dynamics
Hybrid dynamics transition presented here is similar to [8]
for underactuated continuous-time system, see Fig. 7. State
of the system is described as

F . Local stability

hybrid system, state space dynamic equations (20) have to
be linearized around equilibrium point, see e.g. [13]. If for

IV. SIMULATION
The derived model for the system with continuous contact
is tested in a simulation. This results in a particular scenario
of alternating ball catching and throwing to perform juggling
and dribbling as discussed in Sec. III.D. In case of juggling
the ball is released from a particular height and then caught
at the instance when the velocity of the beam and the ball are
equal, ensuring smooth catching of the last. The beam then
moves back to its initial position, imparting velocity to the
ball which then rises back to its maximum height. The same
holds for dribbling, but only with additional impact with the
ground instead of going to prescribed height. The simulation
results are presented in Fig. 9 and 10.
V. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
This paper presented design and analysis of an elastic end-
effector for active juggling of a ball. The dynamics of an
elastic beam clamped at one end with a 3 DOF robotic arm
was analyzed. This method is used for dribbling and juggling
a ball by the proper excitation and control of the beam.
The simulations show how a variety of tasks like catching,
throwing and juggling can be achieved by a single end-
effector. Although the juggling experiment was sensitive to
initial conditions, our theory with an actual implementation

of dribbling showing very high repeatability and robustness
was experimentally justiÞed.
In the future, juggling techniques with lateral ball move-
ments like shower, waterfall and cascade for juggling mul-
tiple balls will be implemented. Moreover, the investigation
on the variation of amplitudes, frequencies and accelerations
at impact are responsible for switching between various
dynamic actions is planned.
