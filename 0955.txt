Abstract—This paper describes the design and implemen-
tation of a robust position tracking control scheme for an
Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV). The proposed con-
troller does not require knowledge of the vehicle’s dynamic
parameters and guarantees prescribed transient and steady
state performance despite the presence of external disturbances
acting on the vehicle. The resulting scheme is of low complexity
and computational cost and thus can be easily integrated
to an embedded control platform of an AUV. The proposed
control scheme has analytically guaranteed stability and con-
vergence properties, while its applicability and performance
are experimentally veriﬁed using the Girona500 AUV into
two different missions: a) navigation and stabilization to a
speciﬁc conﬁguration, b) meandrus-like trajectory tracking.
In both cases the vehicle was under the inﬂuence of time-
varying external disturbances caused by a high-pressure water
jet installed on the Girona500 manipulator.
I. INTRODUCTION
During the last few decades underwater vehicles are being
extensively used for complex operations and dexterous tasks
such as surveillance and mapping of underwater structures,
ship hull inspection, handling of underwater equipment (e.g
control panels, valves), search and rescue missions, etc. In
most of these cases, the vehicles operate under the inﬂuence
of strong external disturbances caused from ocean currents
and waves. Moreover, the vehicle’s dynamic parameters are
likely to change, because different types of sensors and tools
are utilized, depending on the requirements of each mission,
for the AUV state estimation as well as the perception of the
environment. Thus, the motion control scheme of an AUV
should be robust against external disturbances and up to a
certain extent, independent from the vehicle’s dynamics.
The motion control problem for autonomous underwater
vehicles has been an active research ﬁeld for the past
two decades and continues to pose considerable challenges
to control designers especially when the vehicles exhibit
large model uncertainty and are affected by environmental
disturbances. A typical motion control problem is trajectory
tracking which is concerned with the design of control laws
that force a vehicle to reach and follow a reference trajectory.

Classical approaches such as local linearization and input-
output decoupling have been used in the past to design
tracking controllers for underactuated vehicles [1]. Neverthe-
less, the aforementioned methods yielded poor closed loop
performance and the results were local, around only certain
selected operating points. Alternative approaches involved
output feedback linearization combined with PID control,
linear quadratic optimal control and H
∞
control [2]–[4],
which, however, was not always possible. Finally, based
on a combined approach involving Lyapunov theory and
the backstepping technique various nonlinear model–based
trajectory tracking controllers have been reported during the
last two decades [5]–[11]. However, these schemes demand a
very accurate knowledge of the vehicle dynamic parameters
which in most cases is quite difﬁcult to obtain.
Despite the recent progress in the tracking control for
underwater vehicles, certain issues still remain open. Notice
that even in case the actual vehicle model is considered
accurately known, external disturbances affect severely the
tracking performance thus making the problem of guarantee-
ing prescribed performance difﬁcult or impossible in certain
situations. The term prescribed performance actually means
that the tracking error should converge to a predeﬁned arbi-
trarily small residual set with convergence rate no less than
a prespeciﬁed value. The tracking performance deterioration
becomes more intense when uncertainty in the vehicle model
is also present.

control scheme for an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle is
presented. The proposed controller does not utilize the vehi-
cle’s dynamic model parameters and guarantees prescribed
transient and steady state performance despite the presence
of external disturbances. Moreover, through the appropriate
selection of certain performance functions, the proposed
scheme can also guarantee the satisfaction of motion and
performance constraints imposed by the desired task. In this
work, the applicability and performance of the proposed
scheme are depicted using the Girona500 AUV (Fig. 1) oper-
ating in two different tasks: a) navigation and stabilization to
a speciﬁc conﬁguration, b) meandrus-like trajectory tracking.
In order to prove the robustness of the system, a water
jet equipment was installed on the Girona500 manipulator.
During the experiments, the manipulator was moving in
different directions with the water jet running, imposing
strongtime-variantandmultidirectionalexternaldisturbances
on the vehicle.
II. PRELIMINARIES
A. AUV Kinematics and Dynamics
In this work, we consider the Girona500 autonomous
underwater vehicle (see Fig. 1). A simpliﬁed 3D dynamic
model (in surge, sway, heave and yaw) of the vehicle is
presented in this subsection in accordance to the standard
underwater vehicle modeling properties [12]. The roll and
pitch degrees of freedom are neglected for the clarity of
the presentation and owing to page limitations. It will be
mentioned in the sequel, however, that the stability of both
degrees of freedom can be secured owing to their Input to
State Stability (ISS) properties, without compromising the
achievedresults.Inthisrespect,considerthevehiclemodeled
as a rigid body subject to external forces and torques. Let
{I} be an inertial coordinate frame and {B} a body-ﬁxed
coordinate frame, whose origin O
B
is located at the center of
mass of the vehicle. Furthermore, let (x;y;z) be the position
of O
B
in{I} and? denote the yaw angle. Let (u;v;w) be the
longitudinal (surge), transverse (sway) and vertical (heave)
velocities of O
B
with respect to {I} expressed in {B} and r
be the vehicle’s angular speed (yaw) around the vertical axis.
Thus, the kinematic equations of motion for the considered
vehicle can be written as:
˙ x=ucos??vsin?+?
x

˙ y=usin?+vcos?+?
y
(t) (2)

where ?

rents. Neglecting the motion in roll and pitch, the simpliﬁed

to produce the desired motion of the body ﬁxed frame.
B. Navigation Module
The navigation module is responsible for estimating the
state feedback for the control scheme and more speciﬁc the
vehicle position and velocity vector. The linear positions
([x y z]) and velocities ([u v w]) are estimated using a Vision
EKF SLAM algorithm, while the angular positions ([? ? ?])
and velocities ([p q r]) are directly measured using an
inertial measurement unit (IMU). The Vision EKF SLAM
algorithm provides simultaneously estimation updates for the
visual landmarks and the linear positions and velocities of
the vehicle.
The augmented system model (vehicle and landmarks)
consists of a constant velocity kinematic model for the
vehicleandaconstanttimemodelforthelandmarks.Regard-
ing the measurement models, position and velocity sensors
are available. A global positioning system (GPS) measures
the vehicle position in (x; y) plane when the vehicle is
not submerged and a pressure sensor transforms pressure
values into depth measurements (z). The velocity updates are
providedbyadopplervelocitylog(DVL).Thissensorisable
to measure linear velocities with respect to the sea bottom or
the water around the vehicle. The pose and velocity updates
are direct measurements of the state vector.
If only these two updates are available, the navigation
module is a dead reckoning algorithm that drifts over time.
However, if landmarks are detected in the environment, the
navigation module is able to keep its position covariance
bounded. A visual detection algorithm, gives information
about the relative position of a landmark with respect to
the vehicle. This information not only updates the detected
landmarks position but also the vehicle’s. The visual detec-
tion algorithm uses an a priori known template to identify
and compute the relative position of these landmarks. During
the experiments an underwater panel was used as the main
landmark. The mathematical description of the navigation
module and the Vision EKF SLAM algorithm are out of the
scope of this paper and thus are omitted.
C. Prescribed Performance
It will be clearly demonstrated in Subsection III-A, that
thecontroldesignisconnectedtotheprescribedperformance
notion that was originally employed to design neuro-adaptive
controllers for various classes of nonlinear systems [13]–
[15], capable of guaranteeing output tracking with prescribed
performance. In this work, by prescribed performance, it
is meant that the tracking error converges to a predeﬁned
6530
arbitrarily small residual set with convergence rate no less
than a certain predeﬁned value. For completeness and com-
pactness of presentation, this subsection summarizes prelimi-
nary knowledge on prescribed performance. Thus, consider a
generic scalar error e(t). Prescribed performance is achieved
if e(t) evolves strictly within a predeﬁned region that is
bounded by decaying functions of time. The mathematical
expression of prescribed performance is given, ?t ≥ 0, by
the following inequalities:
??(t)<e(t)<?(t) (9)
where ?(t) is a smooth, bounded, strictly positive and de-
creasing function of time satisfying lim
t?∞
?(t)>0, called
performance function [13]. Hence, for an exponentially de-
creasing performance function ?(t) = (?
0
??

)e
?lt
+?

with ?
0
, ?
∞
, l, the constant ?
0
=?(0) is selected such that
?
0
>|e(0)|, the constant ?
∞
= lim
t?∞
?(t) represents the
maximum allowable size of the tracking error e(t) at the
steady state and ﬁnally the decreasing rate of ?(t), which
is affected by the constant l in this case, introduces a lower
bound on the required speed of convergence of e(t).

without incorporating any information regarding the vehicle
model, such that: a) it tracks the desired trajectory with the
desired orientation via bounded closed loop signals and b) it
achieves prescribed transient and steady state performance,
despite the presence of exogenous disturbances representing
ocean currents and waves.

Remark 1: The proposed control scheme does not incor-
porate the vehicle’s dynamic model parameters or knowledge
of the external disturbances. Furthermore, no estimation (i.e.,
adaptive control) has been employed to acquire such knowl-
edge. Moreover, compared with the traditional backstepping-
like approaches, the proposed methodology proves signif-
icantly less complex. Notice that no hard calculations are
required to output the proposed control signals thus making
its implementation straightforward.
B. Stability Analysis
The main results of this work are summarized in the
followingtheoremwhereitisproventhattheaforementioned

(11)-(12). The proposed control scheme (13)-(15) guarantees

that the vehicle tracks the desired trajectory and orientation
with prescribed transient and steady state performance.

and the overall closed loop system state vector as:

.
Differentiating the normalized errors with respect to time
and substituting (1)-(8) as well as (13)-(15), we obtain in
a compact form, the dynamical system of the overall state
vector:
˙
? =h(t;?) (18)
where the function h(t;?) includes all terms found at the
right hand side after the differentiation of ?. Let us also
deﬁne the open set:
?
?
=(?1;1)?···?(?1;1)
| {z }
8-times
.
The proof proceeds in two phases. First, the existence of
a maximal solution ?(t) of (18) over the set ?
?
for a
time interval [0;?
max
) (i.e., ?(t) ? ?
?
, ?t ? [0;?
max
)) is
ensured. Then, we prove that the proposed control scheme
guarantees, for all t ? [0;?
max
): a) the boundedness of all
closed loop signals as well as that b) ?(t) remains strictly
within a compact subset of?
?
, which subsequently will lead
by contradiction to ?
max
=∞. Hence, from (16), we may
conclude that:
??
x

for all t≥0 and consequently that tracking with prescribed
performance is achieved as stated at the beginning of the
section.
Phase A. The set ?

is nonempty and open. Moreover,
owing to the selection of the performance functions ?
i

(i.e., |e

that ?(0)??

is also deduced. Finally, differentiating (13) and (14) with

Remark 2: From the aforementioned proof, it is worth
noticing that the proposed control scheme achieves its
goals without residing to the need of rendering

the actual tracking performance, which is determined by the
performance functions ?

isolated against model uncertainties thus extending the ro-
bustness of the proposed control scheme.
Remark 3: In this work, neglecting the pitch and roll
degrees of freedom, we considered a simpliﬁed underwater
vehicle model for the clarity of the presentation and owing
to page limitations. However, due to the passivity of pitch
and roll degrees of freedom, it can be easily deduced
followingastandardInputtoStateStability(ISS)framework,
that a complete model with all 6 DOFs can be handled,
without altering the proposed control scheme. Actually, the
aforementioned statement will be veriﬁed by the following
experimental results with the Girona500 AUV.
IV. EXPERIMENTS
To illustrate the performance of the proposed control
scheme, two experimental procedures were carried out: a)
navigation and stabilization to a speciﬁc conﬁguration, b)
meandrus-like trajectory tracking. The experiments took
place inside a water tank using the Girona500 AUV. A
panel consisting of valves and handles located inside the
pool was used as the visual target during the experiments
and the navigation module described in subsection II-B was
responsible for providing the state feedback to the closed
loop system in both experiments. In order to create strong
external disturbances to the system, a water jet mechanism
was installed on the AUV 4 DoFs robotic manipulator. The
water jet was installed on the second rotational DoF of the
manipulator which was moving constantly in both experi-
ments in order to create time-varying and multidirectional
external disturbances, as shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. 5.
A. Navigation and Stabilization towards a speciﬁc conﬁgu-
ration (control panel)
In this experiment, the vehicle starts from an arbitrary
initial conﬁguration in order to navigate and stabilize to-
wards a speciﬁc conﬁguration (in front of a control panel).
During the motion, the vehicle is constantly under the effect
of time-varying and multidirectional external disturbances
caused by the water jet mechanism. The required transient
and steady state speciﬁcations, (that is, maximum steady
state position errors 0.05m, maximum steady state orien-
tation error 5
o
and exponential convergence e
?0:1t
), are
described by the following performance functions: ?
x

?0:1t

y

?
w

r

Finally, the control gains were chosen as follows: k

z

u

The tracking error evolution is depicted in Fig. 2. The
red lines indicate the desired performance bounds and the
blue lines indicate the evolution of the tracking errors e
x
(t),
e
y
(t), e
z
(t) and e
?
(t) respectively. All the errors have met
the transient and steady state speciﬁcations imposed by the
previously selected performance functions. As it can be seen
from the results, the control objective has been achieved
under the inﬂuence of external disturbances.
B. Meandrus-like Trajectory Tracking
In this experiment, the vehicle starts from an arbitrary
initial conﬁguration in order to perform a meandrus-like
trajectory tracking under the effect of time-varying and
multidirectional external disturbances. The required transient
and steady state speciﬁcations are the same with the previous
experiment. Therefore, we employed the same performance
functions and control gains in the control scheme.
The tracking error evolution during the steady state is
depicted in Fig. 4. The red lines indicate the desired perfor-
mance bounds and the blue lines indicate the evolution of the
tracking errors e
x
(t), e
y
(t), e
z
(t) and e
?
(t) respectively. As
it is demonstrated by the experiments and predicted from the
theoretical analysis, the control objective has been achieved
in the presence of external disturbances.
V. CONCLUSIONS
This paper describes the design and implementation of a
novel trajectory tracking control scheme for an Autonomous
Underwater Vehicle (AUV). The proposed control scheme
does not utilize the vehicle’s dynamic model parameters
and guarantees prescribed transient and steady state perfor-
mance despite the presence of external disturbances. The
proposed scheme is of low complexity and has analytically
guaranteed stability and convergence properties, while its
applicability and performance were experimentally veriﬁed
using the Girona500 AUV operating under time-varying
external disturbances towards two missions: a) navigation
