  
Abstract—Tracking accuracy in ground vehicle path 
following is an important topic addressed by vehicle steering 
control. While several controllers exist, this controller aims to 
provide improved path following while cornering on sloped 
terrain. Towards this goal, this work develops a new kinematic 
controller that considers the effect of slip and a new dynamic 
controller that better compensates modelling error and actuator 
disturbances. The kinematic controller uses a new kinematic 
model and applies backstepping architecture with variable 
structure control manifolds to assure smooth and graceful yaw 
rate commands.  The dynamic controller is also based upon 
backstepping, but introduces integrator states to the 
architecture and derives a new controller to improve yaw rate 
tracking.  Simulations and field experiments demonstrate 
resulting performance improvements, which are compared to 
prior work to highlight contributions of this work. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
RACEFUL and robust steering control of full size ground 
vehicles is critical for passenger comfort and safety, 
which impacts both Automated Ground Vehicle (AGV) and 
driver assistance technology. Numerous steering controllers 
have been developed, but many of them are focused on 
sensor-based navigation, such as DARPA Urban Challenge 
vehicles [1] or Google Car [2], or kinematic control [3]. 
Although sensor-based navigation can consider driving safety 
from a planning perspective, it does not consider vehicle 
response while applying the steering commands. On the other 
hand, kinematic-based steering control can work at low 
speeds, but it is inappropriate for high speeds and varying 
conditions. Vehicle side slip determines dynamic interactions 
between the vehicle and ground, which must be considered in 
order to allow vehicles to respond appropriately to their 
environment. Control of slip is critical for vehicle 
maneuverability, accurate path following, and graceful 
motion. Thus, a combined kinematic and dynamic controller 
is necessary to consider steering commands, vehicle yaw rate, 
and side slip.   
This paper presents a novel steering controller to improve 
path following accuracy. Fig 1 presents the architecture of this 
steering controller and the symbol definitions refer to Sec II 
and III.  Since slip is typically a major source of tracking error, 
this work considers slip-based kinematics in order to derive 
yaw rate commands for path following.  A slip-yaw dynamic 
model then provides a basis for deriving steering rate 
commands and a sensor based observer provides estimates of 
slip and yaw rate for output feedback control. The kinematic 
controller is based upon a backstepping approach where 
lateral tracking error is first regulated by heading. 
Backstepping then considers simultaneous regulation of 
heading and lateral tracking error using yaw rate commands.  
Side-slip is treated as a tracking error term at this level where 
a Variable Structure Control (VSC) approach is used to derive 
graceful and robust yaw rate commands that drive tracking 
error to zero despite slip and external disturbances.   
The dynamic controller then uses a backstepping approach 
where yaw-rate tracking is considered first in order to derive 
steering angles while considering side-slip. Integral control is 
added to compensate modelling errors, external disturbances, 
and actuator backlash for improved tracking. Steering angle 
references are then backstepped into a steering rate controller 
so that the steering actuator provides concurrent tracking of 
both yaw rate and steering angle while considering the effect 
of side-slip and the actuator dynamics.  Integral control is 
added to compensate actuator tracking error caused by 
actuator servo loops and loads acting on the actuator.  An 
observer from [4-6] provides estimates of side slip and yaw 
rates in order to achieve sensor based output feedback control. 
While many researchers have examined AGV control from 
a kinematics perspective, a limited number have considered 
dynamics with kinematics, and some just consider dynamics. 
For example, Stanford has relied heavily upon kinematic 
control, but has provided some consideration of dynamics.  In 
[7], they consider tire slip angle and cornering stiffness to 
determine discrete sets of feasible steering angles which 
planning algorithms then select from. They achieved good 
accuracy in off-road trajectory-tracking, but did not consider 
graceful motion nor active control of vehicle dynamics. 
Werling [3] provides a tighter integration by using a 
longitudinal dynamic model in addition to a standard bicycle 
kinematic model, but slip is not considered.  This improves 
tracking capability where speed variations are small, but it 
may cause a vehicle to become unstable at higher speeds 
under varying conditions. Others consider dynamic control, 
but only provide simulation results [8, 9]. 
Only a few researchers [10, 11] have considered kinematic 
and dynamics models similar to our own in [4-6], and results 
from these works are limited. Wang et al [10] uses a similar 
control structure, but basic PD control for kinematics and 
SMC for dynamics, where steering angle is used as the control 
input. PD control results in sensitivity to initial conditions and 
limited ability to reject disturbances and compensate for slip.

Likewise, vehicle handling capability and actuator limitations 
are not considered, and the tire-ground model used in their 
dynamic controller would be difficult to implement in a full-
size vehicle. Lastly, only simulation results are provided and 
hence practicality of this approach is not demonstrated. Raffo 
et al [11] uses an architecture and slip-yaw model similar to 
our own, but uses more sophisticated predictive control 
compared to [10]. Experimental results are also provided, but 
the platform is a smaller Mini-baja vehicle, and side slip and 
steering dynamics are ignored due to computational 
limitations.  As a result, the vehicle operates at low speeds (1 
to 2.77 m/s) to maintain stability and tracking accuracy, and 
slip is ultimately ignored in their results. 
This paper shares some features and approaches with our 
prior work [4-6], such as the multi-tiered control architecture, 
the VSC approach in the kinematic controller, and the 
backstepping approach in the dynamic controller. However, 
[4-6] do not consider the effect of side slip in the vehicle 
kinematics, whereas this paper does. As a result, this paper 
presents new kinematic models considering slip and their new 
controllers. Our prior work used either Sliding Mode Control 
(SMC) [4, 5] or VSC [6] to design the kinematic controller, 
but this did not consider possible model error in this manifold 
coupling. This paper uses a backstepping approach to better 
assure sequential convergence of lateral error and heading 
error despite possible modelling error. This paper applies 
similar VSC manifolds from [6] to achieve smooth and 
graceful motion, but the resulting controller is new.  Our prior 
work [5, 6] also used a backstepping approach in the dynamic 
controller to realize reference yaw rates, but this work adds 
integral terms to improve tracking and results in a new 
backstepping controller. This paper and our prior work both 
use the same high gain observer to estimate slip and yaw rate. 
The structure of the paper is as follows.  Section II provides 
the revised kinematic model and the dynamic model that form 
the basis of the controllers.  The new kinematic controller is 
presented in Section III and the new dynamic controller is 
presented in Section IV.  Simulation and experimental results 
highlighting resulting performance improvements are shown 
in Sections V and VI, respectively.  Concluding remarks are 
provided in Section VII. 
II. MODELING 
A. Kinematic Model 
As in [4-6], the vehicle kinematics are 
demonstrated as Fig 2. Likewise, the 
vehicle kinematic model is described by 
a classic non-slip bicycle model as: 
 cos xV ? ?  (1) 
 sin yV ? ? (2) 
( / ) tan V L r ?? ? ? ?  (3) 
 ?? ?  (4) 
where P a = [x, y, ?] is the posture of the 
vehicle. The vehicle heading angle is ?, 
and its time derivative is yaw rate, r. The 
front steering angle is ?, while its time 
derivative is steering rate, ?. The 
longitudinal and lateral positions in the global frame XOY are 
x and y. The vehicle forward speed is V.  
The lateral tracking error, y e is defined as the closest 
distance from P a to the reference path. The reference yaw rate 
is /
ref
V V R ?? ?? , where ? is the reference path curvature 
and a reciprocal of radius of path, R.  
Because the longitudinal motion is insignificant to path 
following motion, we thus neglect (1) and only consider (2)
~(4) in this paper. (4) describes the steering actuator dynamics 
and steering capability and is split from kinematics and added 
to dynamics as augmented dynamic states. The kinematic 
model expressed in tracking error form is: 
 
e
rV ?? ??  (5) 
 sin
ee
yV ? ?  (6) 
where 
e
? is the heading error, and 
e ref
? ? ? ?? .  
(5) and (6) do not consider the impact of side slip to 
kinematics, which is a critical reason to cause lateral tracking 
error in our prior work. Thus, we modify the kinematic model 
to become a slip-based kinematic model by including the side 
slip disturbance term as:

where 
e
? is a nominal heading error; ? is a side slip 
disturbance term. The actual heading error is 
e
? . The new 
slip-based kinematic model is applied for the kinematic 
controller design. 
B. Dynamic Model 
Likewise, the vehicle dynamic model is approximated by a 
slip and yaw based bicycle model as in Fig 3, where we 
introduce a cornering stiffness model to describe side slip, ?, 
yaw rate, r, and lateral dynamics. 
Unlike prior work, we now can consider the kinematic 
velocity, V = v, which reduces the uncertainty that existed 
between kinematic and dynamic models in [4-6]. The 
variation of vehicle velocity is small and slow and treated as 
uncertainty, which is an appropriate assumption to common 
high-speed or low-speed driving. By including the steering 
actuator dynamics (4), the vehicle dynamic model is 
described as:

where C f  and C r are the actual cornering stiffness of front and 
rear tires and defined as: C f  = µ C f0 and C r = µ C r0 where µ is 
road coefficient. C f0 and C r0 are cornering stiffness on an ideal 
road (i.e. µ = 1). m and J are mass and inertia. a and b are 
distances from CG location to front and rear axle center. Note 
that the vehicle velocity is assumed positive, v > 0. In order to 
start from rest where v = 0, the vehicle needs to be driven for 
a while before the controller and observer are engaged. (10) ~ 
(12) are represented in a simplified form:

III. KINEMATIC CONTROLLER 
The goal of the kinematic controller is to provide yaw rate 
commands that drive lateral and heading tracking error to zero 
gracefully. However, due to the simplification of side slip in 
describing vehicle kinematics, accurate tracking performance 
cannot be sufficiently achieved. We thus remodel the vehicle 
kinematics by addressing a slip-based kinematic model to 
compensate the impact of side slip to lateral tracking error.  
The yaw rate, r, still serves as the kinematic control 
command for its intuitive relation to side slip, vehicle 
steering, and graceful motion. The current kinematic model is 
restructured in a cascading form by including integrators:

LaSalle’s invariance principle [12], the origin x 1 is 
asymptotically stable. Note that a saturation function is 
applied within the arcsin term of (20) to assure it is bounded 
within [-1, 1]. 
As in Section II, the vehicle velocity in (20) is also assumed 
V > 0, while the vehicle needs to be driven to achieve the 
threshold velocity to avoid singularity before the kinematic 
controller is fully engaged. In the field experiments, the 
threshold velocity is V = 0.5 m/s

In principle, (28) is able to satisfy the request to provide 
appropriate yaw rate commands by considering the impact of 
side slip. However, based upon preliminary simulations, it has 
limited tuning capability to path manifolds for achieving 
graceful motion. Also, (28) is insufficient to provide 
robustness to uncertainties caused by the interaction of 
vehicle kinematics and dynamics. Thus, we revisit (25) and 
(28) and redesign the control law by embedding a variable 
structure control (VSC) approach for solving these two issues.

Compared to (28), (33) is more conservative but provides 
path manifold tuning ability and robustness by embedding a 
VSC approach in the backstepping control frame. 
IV. DYNAMIC CONTROLLER 
The dynamic controller generates steering commands to 
create the yaw rate specified by the kinematic controller. This 
yaw rate is defined as, r ref, according to (33). The actual yaw 
rate from the dynamics is now referred to, r. The yaw rate 
tracking error is r e,  where r e = r - r ref. 
The yaw rate tracking error models are derived as (34) and 
(35), while the desired steering angle, ? des, is the control input. 
The integral of yaw error, ?, is used to compensate steady state 
yaw rate tracking error caused by modeling error and external 
uncertainty. Despite of these uncertainty in the vehicle 
dynamics, the yaw rate command terms, r ref and its time 
derivatives are highly nonlinear. Thus, although the vehicle 
dynamic model is linearized, the robust backstepping strategy 
is applied to the dynamic controller for improving control 
performance in practice.

which can be stabilized by the robust controller.

V. SIMULATION 
The vehicle parameters maintain their definition in Section 
II. The nominal values are the same as [6]: C f = 110000 N/rad, 
C r = 110000 N/rad; a = 1.2 m, b = 1.8 m; m = 2300 kg, J = 
4500 kg.m
2
. These values are also used in observer and 
controller in simulations and field experiments.  
The simulated vehicle system is perturbed to evaluate 
robustness such that C f = 230000 N/rad, C r = 200000 N/rad; 
a = 1.3 m, b = 1.7 m; m = 2540 kg, J = 5000 kg.m

effects are simulated by drag coefficient 0.41 N/(m/s)

 and 
wind lift coefficient 0.005 N/(m/s)

nominal and simulated systems or actual vehicle systems 
create uncertainty and disturbances in the controller and 
observer. To compare the current steering controller with [6], 
all parameters are set identical to [6]: the vehicle forward 
speed V = 20 m/s, the road coefficient µ = 0.8. The initial error 
for simulation is [? ? ? ? ] = [0.0873 2]. The designated 
path is still “U” shaped with two 100-meter straight paths and 
one radius of 50-m and a 180-degree arc path.  
Fig 4 and Fig 5 demonstrate the control performance of our 
current steering controller and the prior steering controller in 
[6]. Obviously, the current steering controller based on slip-
based kinematics provides better path-following performance 
in cornering. Moreover, due to the effect of integrator states, 
the performance of side slip estimates are also improved. The 
control commands have less oscillation on the places of path 
curvature discontinuity compared with the steering control 
from [6]. These features present that the slip-based steering 
controller is capable of achieving accurate and graceful 
motion in following a given path. 
VI. EXPERIMENTS 
The testing platform and field environment are the same as 
in [4-6], where GPS is used for sensing vehicle posture. A 
digital gyroscope is used to sense vehicle yaw rate and reduce 
noise in the yaw rate and side slip estimates. Unlike [5, 6], the 
steering rate signals are made available. 
Field tests are similar to [6] and simulations. However, 
some necessary differences exist. The 10% slope of terrain is 
still added to this automated vehicle and leads to non-trivial 
gravity disturbance in the downhill and uphill driving. Due to 
the limited field (parking lot), this paper only presents 1.5 ~ 3 
m/s low-speed experimental results for validation.  
Comparing the measured yaw rate signals to the estimated 
ones, Fig 6, note that differences are very small.  This hints 
that the estimation of side slip is accurate and close to the true 
value. Similarly, the actual steering rate is close to the desired 
steering rate command from the dynamic controller.  This 
demonstrates the effectiveness of the backstepping and 
steering actuator controllers. Likewise, the steering 
commands are more easily achieved, which reduces 
overshoot. This proves the necessity of considering steering 
actuator dynamics in the steering controller design. Finally, 
heading and lateral error are driven to zero, with some sensor 
noise shown, which is a notable improvement over [6].  
VII. CONCLUSION 
This paper presents a slip-based backstepping variable 
structure steering controller for Autonomous Ground 
Vehicles. This algorithm considers the significant impact of 
side slip in improving vehicle tracking performance. The 
simulations demonstrate that the tracking error has been 
significantly reduced compared to our prior work. Field 
experiments validate simulations by demonstrating very small 
tracking error compared to prior work. Future work will 
provide a stability analysis including kinematics and 
dynamics. Experiments will be operated by applying different 
paths at different forward speeds.
