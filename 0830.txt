Abstract— Parallel surface contact between the template and
the substrate is very important in imprint lithography. In this
paper, a novel force-decoupled compound parallel alignmen-
t stage is proposed for high-resolution imprint lithography.
It mainly consists of a high-stiffness spherical air bearing
(SAB) and a multi-degree-of-freedom (multi-DOF) ﬂexure-
based mechanism that functions for both the active and passive
alignments. Apart from the function of the parallel alignment,
the proposed stage can also endure a large imprinting force
of more than 1000 N but does not cause any damage to the
delicate components, which is mainly attributed to its force-
decoupled characteristic. Through the stiffness modeling and
ﬁnite element analysis (FEA), the performance is evaluated
to satisfy the design requirement. Finally, experimental tests
are conducted on the parallel alignment stage for the hot
embossing process, and the grating patterns with linewidth of
2.5 mm are successfully transferred from the silicon template
to the polymethy methacrylate (PMMA) substrate. This result
demonstrates that the proposed stage can be used in the hot
embossing process without degrading its alignment accuracy.
I. INTRODUCTION
Nanoimprint lithography (NIL) is a new method to fab-
ricate micro/nano patterns due to its simplicity, high repli-
cation ﬁdelity, low cost and high throughput, etc, and it is
usually considered as a promising technique for the next gen-
eration lithography (NGL) [1], [2]. Unlike the conventional
photolithography and other NGL techniques, NIL mainly
relies on the physical deformation of the resist and has been
successfully utilized in the fabrication of micro/nano struc-
tures [3]-[6]. The resolution of NIL is mainly determined
by the minimum feature size on the template that can be
fabricated, thus it can achieve a very high resolution within
a few nanometers. Moreover, the parallel surface contact
between the template and the substrate is very important
for pattern ﬁdelity in NIL, whereas the nonparallel surface
contact will lead to the uneven patterns on the substrate
[7]-[9]. In this light, the parallel alignment stage is usually
utilized to compensate for this parallel error.
For the parallel alignment stages, research attentions have
been focused on three categories, namely, the passive, active
and compound alignment stages, which usually resort to the

ﬂexure-based mechanism due to the merits of no backlash, no
friction, and free lubrication [10]-[14]. The passive alignment
stage is to utilize the elastic deformation of ﬂexible elements
to passively eliminate the parallel error between the template
and the substrate, whereas the active one is to utilize the high-
resolution sensors for error detection and then to actively
eliminate it. It is conceivable that the compound alignment
stage is the combination of the above two stages. Normally,
the passive alignment stage has a simpler structure, and the
active one comes second, followed by the most complicated
compound one. Lee et al. developed a six-DOF passive
compliant stage for the complete surface contact between the
template and the substrate [15], [16]. It consisted of an inner
mechanism and an outer mechanism connected in series for
the in-plane and out-of-plane motions, respectively. Jia et al.
described a three-DOF actively controlled compliant parallel
stage utilizing ﬂexure hinges for NIL [17]. The stiffness of
the overall system was analyzed using the matrix method.
Choi et al. designed a compound parallel alignment stage
for step and ﬂash imprint lithography [18]. The orientation of
the template with respect to the substrate was ﬁrst manually
adjusted by using three differential micrometers, and then a
two-DOF passive rotational ﬂexure-based stage was utilized
to eliminate the residual parallel error.
Unfortunately, the existing techniques used in the design of
NIL alignment systems do not consider the issue of delicate
components within the imprinting force transmission loop,
thus resulting in a problem that the alignment accuracy can-
not be guaranteed especially under a large imprinting force.
To address this problem, this paper will comprehensively
analyze and study the fundamental working principle of NIL
machine and proposes a novel design approach to the parallel
alignment stage with the function of decoupling the large
imprinting force from the delicate components. It mainly
consists of a high-stiffness spherical air bearing (SAB) and
a multi-DOF ﬂexure-based mechanism. The large imprinting
force is supported by the high-stiffness SAB, whereas only
the small bending moment due to the nonuniform imprinting
force can reach the delicate ﬂexure-based mechanism. Thus,
this approach will make the alignment system able to be
used not only for the ultraviolet (UV) imprinting process, but
also for the hot embossing process. Finally, the validity and
feasibility of the research approach will be veriﬁed through
an actual experimental prototype. We believe that this re-
search will provide the theoretical and technical supports for
the development of precision NIL machines, and meanwhile
will lay a solid foundation for the research of micro/nano-
fabrication consistency and mass production.

II. MECHANICAL DESIGN
The force-decoupled compound parallel alignment stage
for NIL is developed as shown in Fig. 1. It can be seen
that the alignment stage mainly consists of a high-stiffness
SAB with a bowl-shaped stator and a hemispherical rotor,
a magnetic preload mechanism, and a multi-DOF ﬂexure-
based mechanism that functions for the active and passive
alignments. Moreover, three uniformly distributed force sen-
sors (not all shown in the ﬁgure) are utilized to measure the
imprinting force distribution over the template.
In order to achieve a frictionless two-DOF rotation of
the SAB rotor about the x- and y-axes for the parallel
alignment, the pressurized air from the air inlet is transmitted
to the stator-rotor interface to form a thin air ﬁlm through
twelve uniformly distributed tiny oriﬁces. For a good airtight
condition, two O-shaped seal rings are placed at the inner and
outer sides of the annular groove, respectively. Moreover,
the template center O coincides with the spherical center
of the SAB stator or rotor to avoid the lateral motion of
the template due to its tilt. Two sets of annular permanent
magnets are mounted in the stator and the rotor, respectively,
to balance the gravity of the rotor and provide a preload to
the air ﬁlm for maximizing its stiffness and maintaining a
constant thickness [19]. The material of the stator and the
rotor is magnetic stainless steel with high permeability to
avoid the magnetic ﬂux leakage.
For the multi-DOF ﬂexure-based mechanism, it mainly
consists of an outer stage and an inner stage. The outer stage
is a decoupled parallel XY stage with a two-layer stacked
structure. Its in-plane translations are driven by two high-
precision linear actuators. The inner stage attached to the
output end of the outer stage is a serial combination of a
serial XY stage and a three-DOF (i.e., q
x
, q
y
and z) out-of-
plane stage. Moreover, the inner stage is connected to the
SAB rotor through a connecting link. It is known that the
SAB can provide the three-DOF rotational motions, but only
the rotational motions about the x- and y-axes are required
for the parallel alignment in NIL. However, the ﬁve-DOF
structure design of the inner stage can effectively restrict the
undesired self-rotation (q
z
) of the SAB rotor.
As shown in Fig. 2(a), the initial parallel error q
0
between
the template and the substrate is inevitable due to the
manufacturing and assembly errors. During the imprinting
process, thez-axis actuator ﬁrst brings the template in contact
with the substrate until a small imprinting force can be
detected as shown in Fig. 2(b). However, the parallel error
will cause the different results of three force sensors. These
force signals will be sent to the control system to further
drive the outer stage through two linear actuators and then
actively adjust the tilt of the template as shown in Fig. 2(c).
After the active alignment, most of the parallel error can
be eliminated, but there still remains a small parallel error
q
0
due to the limited precision of the adopted actuators and
force sensors. Subsequently, assuming the contact position
“A” between the template and the substrate, as the imprinting
force F continues to increase, it can be transformed into a
vertical force F acting on the template center and a bending
moment M as shown in Fig. 2(d). The vertical force F is
supported by the high-stiffness air ﬁlm, whereas the bending
moment M drives the inner stage to passively adjust the tilt
of the template until eliminating the residual parallel error
q
0
. This also further realizes the function of decoupling the
large imprinting force from the delicate components.
III. ANALYSIS AND MODELING FOR THE PARALLEL
ALIGNMENT STAGE
A. Adjusting Angle Analysis
According to the pseudo-rigid-body model (PRBM) ap-
proach, the parallel XY stage (i.e., the outer stage) and the
serial XY stage can be equivalent to an active prismatic joint

Fig. 3. Simpliﬁed model of the parallel alignment stage for (a) the active
and (b) passive alignments
1 and a passive prismatic joint 2 along the x- or y-axis,
respectively. Similarly, the three-DOF out-of-plane stage can
be also equivalent to a passive universal joint and a passive
prismatic joint 3 along the z-axis, which are connected in
series, and their motion axes intersect at one point P. It is
noticed that the “active” joint means that it is directly driven
by the actuator and conversely it is a “passive” joint. Thus,
it is obvious that only the prismatic joint 1 is the active
one. Due to the symmetric structure, the parallel alignment
stage has the identical performance along the x- and y-axes.
Further, its simpliﬁed model along the x-axis is obtained as
shown in Fig. 3, where K
i
represents the stiffness of the
corresponding equivalent joint.
For the active alignment as shown in Fig. 3(a), the template
actively generates a tilting angle q around its center O
under the input force/displacement (F
in
/d
in
) from the x-
actuator. Considering the distance d of the point P deviating
from the template center O, for a small tilting angle q,
its displacements along the x- and z-axes can be obtained,
respectively, as follows

Moreover, during the initial surface contact between the
template and the substrate, the small imprinting force as the
feedback signal has a small inﬂuence on the deformation
of the ﬂexure-based components. Thus, according to the
conservation of energy, the following equation is obtained
as

Whereas, during the passive alignment process, the active-
ly controlled actuators do not generate any outputs, thus the
output end of the parallel XY stage is ﬁxed as shown in
Fig. 3(b). The large imprinting force F can be transformed
into a vertical force F acting on the template center O and
a bending moment M given by M =

B. Stiffness Modeling
For the parallel XY stage, it consists of four ﬂexure
modules A for the bottom layer and four ﬂexure modules B
for the top layer. After the assembly of the bottom and top
layers, it forms four parallel kinematic chains that connect
the output end to the ﬁxed base, each of which has two
serially connected modules A and B. Moreover, in order to
kinematically decouple the output motions along the x- and
y-axes in the maximum extent, any two adjacent chains are
orthogonal to each other [20], [21]. Similarly, the serial XY
stage includes two ﬂexure modules C connected in parallel in
the x or y direction. It can be seen that although each module
has different numbers of ﬂexure beams, each module utilizes
the secondary stage to increase the motion of the primary
stage, where the former only moves half of the latter, as
shown in Fig. 4.
According to the force analysis of a single ﬂexure beam,
the stiffness of the ﬂexure modules A, B and C can be
obtained, and the detailed stiffness modeling can be found
in [20]. Further, the stiffness of the parallel and serial XY

As shown in Fig. 1, the three-DOF out-of-plane stage is
composed of a tapered split ﬂexure clamp and an annular

IV. FINITE ELEMENT ANALYSIS
In order to evaluate the performance of the parallel align-
ment stage, the ﬁnite element analysis is performed with
commercial software ANSYS 11.0. Based on the geometrical
model as shown in Fig. 1, the ﬁnite element model is
established and then meshed using a three-dimensional 20-
node solid element named SOLID 95. This kind of solid
element is very suitable to model the irregular shapes such
as ﬂexure elements. Moreover, the geometrical parameters of
ﬂexure elements are given as: l
A
= 21 mm, b
A
= 16 mm, t
A
= 0.6 mm, l
B
= 21 mm, b
B
= 16 mm, t
B
= 0.6 mm, l
C
=
12 mm, b
C
= 10 mm, t
C
= 0.5 mm, R = 10 mm, b = 6 mm,
and t = 0.6 mm. AL7075-T651 is selected as the material of
all ﬂexure stages due to its high strength, high elasticity and
light mass. Moreover, the meshes are reﬁned at the ﬂexure
elements with respect to the remaining parts to guarantee the
simulation accuracy.
In the case of the single-axis drive, an input force F
in
of 150 N is applied at the input end of the parallel XY
stage to adjust the template orientation. The simulation result
indicates that the template can generate a tilting angle of
about 5.3 mrad, which meets the design requirement for the
active alignment. Nevertheless, in the case of the double-axis
drive, the tilting angles of the template about the x- and y-
axes are 4.9 mrad and 5.1 mrad, respectively. The deviation
from the single-axis drive is attributed to the coupling effect
between the two drive axes. The resulting maximum stress
within the ﬂexure elements is 152.5 MPa and far less than
the yield strength of the material. Moreover, the template
strictly rotates about its surface center, which beneﬁts from
the coincidence between the template center and the spherical
center of the SAB rotor.
V. EXPERIMENTAL TESTS
During the imprinting experiment, the alignment accuracy
of most of the existing alignment stages cannot be guaranteed
especially in the hot embossing process due to the large
imprinting force. Moreover, the force-decoupled character-
istic of the developed alignment stage for the UV imprinting
process will be not obvious due to its small imprinting force.
Thus, we will only conduct the hot embossing process to
validate the performance of the developed alignment stage.
The ﬁnal experimental apparatus setup is shown in Fig.
6. The NIL machine is mounted on a heavy marble base
with a thin rubber cushion attached to its bottom to reduce
the external vibration disturbances on the pattern transfer
between the template and the substrate. A z-axis actuator and
a preloaded ball screw are employed to realize the vertical
imprint motion, where four precision cylinders are to guide
this motion. Two actuators in the xy plane are utilized to
implement the active alignment between the template and
the substrate. The substrate temperature can be accurately
controlled by the thermal control unit that consists of several
cartridge heaters and thermocouples embedded within the
substrate stage. Aluminum alloy is selected as the material of
the substrate stage to achieve the high thermal conductivity.
Three high-precision force sensors are utilized to measure

the imprinting force distribution over the template for the
closed-loop feedback during the active alignment. Moreover,
an air compressor is required to provide the pressurized air
for the SAB.
It is known that the minimum feature size on the substrate
is mainly determined by that on the template that can be
fabricated. Further, considering the ﬁnal manufacturing cost,
a series of 2.5 mm wide grating patterns with a 3.5 mm period
are fabricated on the silicon template using the electron-
beam process. Polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) is used
as the substrate material due to its small thermal expansion
coefﬁcient of about 6:0 10
 5
per

C and glass transition
temperature (T
g
) of about 105

C. After accomplishing the
imprint process, in order to carefully examine the grating
patterns on the PMMA substrate using the scanning electron
microscope (SEM), a thin Au ﬁlm with thickness of a few
nanometers is ﬁrst uniformly deposited onto its entire sur-
face. Fig. 7 shows the ﬁnal SEM image of the grating patterns
on the substrate surface, where the substrate temperature and
imprinting force used in this experiment are about 145

C
and 1200 N, respectively. It can be seen that the grating
patterns on the substrate are very uniform in a large area.
But the 3.269 mm width and 2.534 mm period of the grating
patterns are a little smaller than the corresponding values
of the template, which is mainly attributed to the PMMA
shrinkage resulting from the temperature drop during the
demolding process. However, this shrinkage can be relieved

strates that the proposed alignment stage can be used in the
hot embossing process. In the next research, we will conduct
the nano-level pattern transfer between the template and the
substrate to verify the deep performance of the proposed
alignment stage.
VI. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
This paper presents the development of a force-decoupled
compound parallel alignment stage to guarantee the align-
ment accuracy especially under a large imprinting force for
the hot embossing NIL. It consists of a high-stiffness SAB
and a delicate multi-DOF ﬂexure-based mechanism. The
template center coincides with the spherical center of the
SAB stator or rotor to avoid the coupled lateral motion of
the template due to its tilt. The large imprinting force is
supported by the high-stiffness SAB, whereas only the small
bending moment due to the nonuniform imprinting force can
reach the ﬂexure-based mechanism. The alignment capacity
of the parallel alignment stage is mainly determined by the
stiffness of the multi-DOF ﬂexure-based mechanism along
the different motion directions. Finite element analysis has
been utilized to investigate the performance of the parallel
alignment stage and examine the accuracy of the established
models. The NIL machine is constructed and tested for the
hot embossing process. The 2.5 mm wide grating patterns
with a 3.5 mm period are successfully transferred from
the silicon template to the PMMA substrate. The substrate
temperature and imprinting force used in this experiment are
about 145

C and 1200 N, respectively.
The addressed parallel alignment problem in this paper
is mainly aimed at the hard plate-to-plate based NIL, and
does not exist on the gas press and soft-template based NIL.
But all of them are only restricted to the small-size template
due to their own disadvantages. In contrast, the roll-to-roll
NIL can achieve a large-size imprint with high efﬁciency.
However, the resolution of the latter is more lower that that
of the former. In the further research, we hope that the
proposed force-decoupled concept can be extended to the
structure design of the roll-to-roll NIL to further improve its
resolution.
