Abstract— A dragline-forming technology has been previ-
ously proposed to enable locomotion through an open-space
where no solid surfaces present. The technology is intended for
situations where payload requirements are unanticipated. In
those situations, variability in dragline’s diameter can minimize
the use of material hence increase self-sufﬁciency of the robot.
In a previous study, a robot was designed, prototyped and
proven to be able to descend through an open-space by forming
a thermoplastic dragline with a diameter range of 1.1-4.5 mm.
However, the speed of locomotion was rather low due to the
lack of an adequate control method for thermoplastic dragline
formation. In this paper, models of mass ﬂow and thermody-
namics along dragline formation pathway are presented. The
models are validated in a newly prototyped robot which forms
a dragline continuously. Experiment results show that, when
compared to the previous prototype and control method which
consists of repeated sequences of discrete events, the speed of
descending locomotion is signiﬁcantly increased and reaches
12.0 cm/min.
I. INTRODUCTION
Previously a spider-inspired mobile technology has been
proposed, where a robot may form draglines from onboard
source material to assist its locomotion in an open-space [1].
Compared to climbing technologies, the proposed technology
enables mobility through a space where no solid surface
presents except the ones at the boundary, e.g. between a
ceiling and a ground, or two vertical walls, or two poles,
etc. Compared to ﬂying technologies, it could provide a
higher payload fraction from dragline assistance. Compared
to using an existing cable and a winch [2], [3], it gives
variation of dragline thickness, which means that given the
same volume of dragline/cable material the length could
be adapted without sacriﬁcing the payload need. Hence
the proposed technology is suitable for unanticipated task-
environments where self-sufﬁciency is vital. In a previous
study, a 300-gram mobile robot has demonstrated descending
locomotion from the solid surface of a hanging structure
through an open-space without any support other than the
dragline formed by itself. The robot was able to form
draglines with a diameter range of 1.1-4.5 mm from onboard
thermoplastic material, implying a payload range of 0.2-7.7
kg that could be carried [1].
While the demonstration has proven the concept, there
remains some technical challenge. One of the biggest chal-
lenge is the speed of locomotion being rather low at 0.73
cm/min. That was partially due to the controller being based

on repetitions of a sequence of discrete events including
supply, deformation and phase transition of the thermoplastic
material. It was also because of the choice of design param-
eters and imprecision in prototyping.
The paper tackles the challenge by showing continuous
dragline formation in an improved prototype of the mobile
robot. With continuous dragline formation, the sequential
events could be carried out in parallel and continuously, and
together with mathematical models describing mass ﬂow and
thermodynamics, faster locomotion should be achieved. The
models are validated in the new prototype which is more
precise, lighter and with onboard battery capability. Exper-
iment of descending with continuous dragline formation is
carried out to evaluate the performance of the technique.

mobile robot. Section III describes mathematical models

II. A DRAGLINE-FORMING MOBILE ROBOT
A robot (see Fig. 1) is prototyped as an improvement
from the one reported in [1]. The improved robot weighs
ca. 185 gram and has an overall dimension of 5318 cm
3
(width, thickness, height). The mechanical structure of the
robot is inspired by the silk production pathway in spiders
[4], [5] and mainly consists of two parts i.e. a material
extrusion mechanism and a coupled deformation-locomotion
mechanism.
The material extrusion mechanism contains solid TPA
(GG02, Dremel, USA) in a cylindrical shape (diameter 7
mm length 10 cm). As shown in Fig. 1, the solid TPA stick
is linearly delivered through a heating cavity and pushed out
of a nozzle. Linear delivery is converted from a DC gear
motor’s rotation through a ball screw ﬁxed with a TPA stick
clutch. The clutch is constrained in linear motion by a linear
track, the end of which is rigidly connected with the DC
gear motor (motor 1, 250:1 gear ratio, Pololu, USA) and
the heating cavity. The heating cavity lies in a cylindrical
aluminium block and has an opening of 7 mm in diameter
at one end and a nozzle with an inner diameter of 4 mm
and an outer diameter of 6 mm at the other end. The cavity
is heated by six 10-
 power resistors connected in parallel
and inserted in the block around the cavity. The TPA stick is
held by the clutch at one end and inserted into the aluminium
cavity at the other end through a silicone tube for leakage
prevention.
The deformation-locomotion mechanism consists of two
geometrically identical cylindrical wheels with a diameter of
12 mm, which are contained in a box. One of the wheels is
ﬁxed on the output shaft of a second DC gear motor (motor
2, 1000:1 gear ratio, Pololu, USA), and the shaft is ﬁxed
on two opposite walls of the containing box. The second
wheel is attached around a second shaft which can move
linearly on a track with a ﬁxed length on the two walls.
The end points of the latter wheel’s shaft are attached to the
box with springs, which pull the wheel towards the centre
of the mechanism. The track constraints this wheel to move
along a linear route while springs allow it to passively adjust
to the variable diameter of the formed dragline. The spring
force is in a linear relation with the distance between the two
wheels, or in other words with the diameter of the formed
dragline. The force gives the normal force which generates
the friction between the formed dragline and the wheels,
enabling the robot to hold onto the formed dragline when
being static. During movement, the mechanism enables the

robot to elongate extruded material as well as moving along
a formed dragline.
The two parts are arranged in such a way that the
deformation-locomotion mechanism is on the upper body
of the robot, and the material extrusion mechanism is on
the lower body. They are connected by a rigid piece so
that the exit of the extrusion nozzle is placed at a distance
of 4 cm under the bottom of the deformation-locomotion
mechanism. A fan is attached to the connecting piece so that
forced convection for cooling is possible when needed. An
electronics unit includes two motor drivers (Dual MC33926,
Pololu, USA), a microcontroller board (Arduino Pro Mini,
Italy), and a USB adapter. The robot could be powered by
external power source, or by two Lithium-Polymer batteries
(ICP543759PMT, Renata, Switzerland). A summary of the
robot and its comparison to the previous prototype is detailed
in Table I.
III. MATHEMATICAL MODELS FOR
CONTINUOUS DRAGLINE FORMATION
To realize continuous dragline formation, the material ﬂow
and thermodynamics of the dragline forming process needs to
be carefully modelled. On the one hand, the material inﬂow
rate and outﬂow rate determine the thickness of a dragline
segment and hence its surface areas, which will have an effect
on thermodynamics. On the other hand, thermodynamics
determines cooling which sets constraints on the highest
possible temperature of a dragline segment before it gets
grabbed by the robot as a support. Since the system couples
locomotion with deformation, the constraints also have an
effect on the speed of the motor for locomotion hence the
material outﬂow rate.
To model the mass ﬂow of material and thermodynam-
ics of the dragline formation process, lumped capacitance
4230
method [6] is used because it is simple, sufﬁcient and compu-
tationally inexpensive for numerical simulation. Speciﬁcally,
by denoting the distance between the exit of the nozzle (point
A in Fig. 2) and the middle contact point on the wheels
(point B) as L
AB
, the dragline between the nozzle and the
two wheels can be represented byN lumps. That means the
lumps are ﬁxed relative to the robot. All lumps have the same
length along the axis of the dragline, therefore the length of
each lump is L = L
AB
=N. In this section, the mass ﬂow
model and the thermodynamics model are described.
A. Mass Flow Model
Mass ﬂow is modelled with the inﬂow and outﬂow of
material within a certain reservoir that is geometrically
overlapped with the very ﬁrst lump just above the nozzle.
It is assumed that the dragline after the mass reservoir has
a constant crosssection diameter D
fd
. At a certain time t,
the mass ﬂow m(t) through the sole mass reservoir is the
integral of mass ﬂow rate over time:

B. Thermodynamics Model
Each lump is a thermal reservoir which is a thermody-
namic open system [7]. By assuming no ﬂow work or shaft
work and a single temperature for each thermal reservoir,
as shown in Fig. 2 for the i-th reservoir from the nozzle
(i=1,2,...,N), its change in internal energy obeys the ﬁrst
law of thermodynamics, and the changing rate of the internal

IV. EXPERIMENT AND RESULTS
To validate the above models and evaluate the performance
of continuous dragline formation, simulation and real-world
experiments have been carried out. Speciﬁcally, the following
aspects were looked into: the diameter range, the locomotion
speed, and the repeatability of a dragline.
A. Simulation
To systematically study the relation between constant
motor speed and dragline diameter, numerical simulation was
implemented in Matlab Simulink based on the above two
mathematical models. In the simulation, design parameters of
the robot and realistic physical parameters of the TPA and the
environment were used (see Table II). More speciﬁcally, six
lumps were constructed (N=6). The speeds of the two motors
f
M1
andf
M2
were set for different values but constant over
each run. Various initial conditions of mass ﬂow rate _ m(0)

constant motor speeds.

and temperature of each lump T
i
(0) were simulated. The
simulation under each conditions was run for 500 seconds
with variable time steps.
Fig. 3 shows the change of the diameter of a dragline
over time during simulation with motor speed f
M1
=0.6 rps
and f
M2
=0.05 rps. The diameter of a dragline reaches an
equilibrium state after some time, and that is because the
mass ﬂow in (5) has stabilized. Simulation with various
initial conditions of mass ﬂow rate from 810
 7
kg/s to
710
 3
kg/s indicates that the diameter of the dragline at the
equilibrium state does not depend on the initial conditions.
Fig. 4 shows the thermodynamics of all the lumps during
simulation with motor speedf
M1
=0.6 rps andf
M2
=0.05 rps.
From an initial temperature that is higher than T
amb
, each
lump decreases temperature until an equilibrium state has
been reached. The important lump here is lump 6, which is
the lump just below the two wheels where the dragline is
grabbed. The criteria for a successful formation requires that
the temperature of lump 6 should be below bond formation
temperatureT
bf
[8], under which TPA is no longer adhesive
thus it won’t stick onto the wheels. It is assumed here this
criteria is always reached in the thermodynamics model and
simulation.

It is worth mentioning that, signiﬁcantly different initial
conditions have been simulated and no change in the above
relation has been found.
It can be also seen from the above relation that, given a
target D
fd
, the speed of motor 1 can be adjusted such that
the speed of motor 2 is the highest possible at that target
D
fd
. That is important to ﬁnd the maximal locomotion speed
of the robot. Interestingly, the maximal locomotion speed
(derived from that of motor 2) depends on D
fd
. As shown
by the theoretical result in Fig. 6, given a range of possible
motor speeds (in this casef
M1
0-2 rps andf
M2
0-0.33 rps),
the maximal locomotion speed decreases with the increase of
target dragline diameter. This feature did not present in the
previous dragline forming method that was based on discrete
events [1], and it is due to coupling between mass ﬂow and
thermodynamics in continuous dragline formation.
B. Real-World Experiment
Real-world experiment of vertical descending was con-
ducted with the physical robot. The robot started by holding
onto the lower tip of a TPA string with a diameter of 2
mm clamped at a height. The robot was externally powered
with 6.8 W so that the TPA extrusion temperature could be
maintained at 70

C. The two DC motors were controlled by
PWM signals in different duty cycles in a pre-programmed
feed-forward controller. Speciﬁcally, twelve trials were made
under different conditions of motor speed, where the duty
cycles for motor 1 ranged 50%-100% corresponding to a
speed from 0.3 to 0.6 rps and for motor 2 ranged 25%-30%
corresponding to a speed from 0.05 to 0.07 rps (less duty
cycle resulted in a too low voltage to drive motor 2).
The robot succeeded in holding onto the dragline formed
by itself and descending with it in ten trials. The diameter
of resulting draglines was between 1.2 mm and 3.2 mm
(mean of ten sampling locations along each dragline), and
the maximal length of the draglines was 66 cm. Fig. 7 shows
snapshots of the ﬁrst 35 seconds in one of the trials (Trial
ID 5, also see a multimedia video). In the trial, motor 1 was
given a signal of a 100% duty cycle (0.6 rps) and motor 2
a 30% duty cycle (0.07 rps). As a result, a dragline with a
mean diameter of 3.1 mm was formed and it reached 36 cm
until the solid TPA stick had to be manually replaced. It can
be seen from the ﬁgure that the robot descended 7 cm in
35 seconds, indicating a locomotion speed of 12.0 cm/min,
which is 16 times as fast as the speed reported in [1].
Fig. 5 plots the dragline diameters of the ten trials, indi-
cated by circle markers. It can be seen that the diameters of
the formed draglines are slightly smaller than the simulation

results. That is probably due to the fact that TPA accumulated
in an irregular shape after being extruded at the exit of the
nozzle, as shown in the insets in Fig. 7. The cone shape made
the dragline thinner than the one if TPA were accumulated
in a cuboid shape.
Regarding the repeatability of dragline formation, which
was measured in relative deviation between dragline diame-
ters and predicted values, the relative deviation using contin-
uous dragline formation is 5-20% which has improved from
the method previously used. The reason of improvement is
that the motors did not have to stop and start from time
to time but rather operated continuously. Fig. 8 shows the
resulting draglines from ﬁve of the successful trials, which
further visualizes the fairly consistent proﬁle of formed
draglines. Failure occured in two out of the twelve trials
in which initial TPA supply was not stable resulting too thin
a segment of the dragline.
A summary about the performance of continuous dragline
formation from the experiment with the physical robot is
given in Table III.
V. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
The paper presents modelling of continuous dragline
formation based on thermoplastics material for the use of
a mobile technology in an open-space with unanticipated
payload requirements. Mathematical models are established
on mass ﬂow of thermoplastics source material and thermo-
dynamics along the dragline formation pathway. Numerical
simulation has been conducted based on the models, and
a physical robot containing TPA has been constructed with
improvement over the previous prototype. Simulation results
suggest the theoretical relation between motor speeds and
dragline diameter, and that maximal locomotion speed is
inversely correlated to the target dragline diameter. Real-
world descending experiment results validate the models and
show that the 185-gram robot could move 16 times as fast as
with the old prototype and discrete control method previously
proposed, reaching 12.0 cm/min. It is worth mentioning that,
a recent study [9] using the new prototype and the previous
control method also conﬁrms the contribution of continuous
dragline formation in doubling the locomotion speed.
Future work includes studying other methods to further
increase the locomotion speed and improve the repeatability
for practical applications. There are at least three possible
ways to further increase the locomotion speed. Firstly, design
parameters such as the distance between the wheels and the
nozzle could be made larger. Secondly, better active cooling
method than a fan can be implemented to increase the heat
transfer coefﬁcient. Thirdly, other types of TPA with a lower
softening point may be helpful. Other interesting scientiﬁc
questions worth investigation are related to the exploration of
other types of thermoplastics as well as the initialization of
the dragline formation from a solid structure. For example,
questions such as how stronger thermoplastics affects the
speed and power consumption, or how adhesion with the
boundary surfaces affects repeatability of a dragline, could
also widen the applications of the technology.
